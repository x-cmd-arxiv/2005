  cooling","Accepted by A&A. 21 pages, 16 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20053649",,"astro-ph",,"  Radio emission models of colliding wind binaries (CWBs) have been discussed
by Dougherty et al. (2003). We extend these models by considering the temporal
and spatial evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic electrons as
they advect downstream from their shock acceleration site. The energy spectrum
evolves significantly due to the strength of inverse-Compton (IC) cooling in
these systems, and a full numerical evaluation of the synchrotron emission and
absorption coefficients is made. We have demonstrated that the geometry of the
WCR and the streamlines of the flow within it lead to a spatially dependent
break frequency in the synchrotron emission. We therefore do not observe a
single, sharp break in the synchrotron spectrum integrated over the WCR, but
rather a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum towards higher frequencies. We
also observe that emission from the wind-collision region (WCR) may appear
brightest near the shocks, since the impact of IC cooling on the non-thermal
electron distribution is greatest near the contact discontinuity (CD). We show
that the thermal emission from a CWB can mimic a thermal plus non-thermal
composite spectrum if the thermal emission from the WCR becomes comparable to
that from the unshocked winds, and obtain a number of insights relevant to
models of closer systems such as WR140. Finally, we apply our new models to the
very wide system WR147. The acceleration of non-thermal electrons appears to be
very efficient in our models of WR147, and we suggest that the shock structure
may be modified by feedback from the accelerated particles. (Abridged).

accumulation of ~1000-km ``planetary embryos'' and a swarm of billions of 1-10
km ``planetesimals.'' During this process, water-rich material is accreted by
the terrestrial planets via impacts of water-rich bodies from beyond roughly
2.5 AU. We present results from five high-resolution dynamical simulations.
These start from 1000-2000 embryos and planetesimals, roughly 5-10 times more
particles than in previous simulations.
  Each simulation formed 2-4 terrestrial planets with masses between 0.4 and
2.6 Earth masses. The eccentricities of most planets were ~0.05, lower than in
previous simulations, but still higher than for Venus, Earth and Mars. Each
planet accreted at least the Earth's current water budget.
  We demonstrate several new aspects of the accretion process: 1) The feeding
zones of terrestrial planets change in time, widening and moving outward. Even
in the presence of Jupiter, water-rich material from beyond 2.5 AU is not
accreted for several millions of years. 2) Even in the absence of secular
resonances, the asteroid belt is cleared of >99% of its original mass by
self-scattering of bodies into resonances with Jupiter. 3) If planetary embryos
form relatively slowly, following the models of Kokubo & Ida, then the
formation of embryos in the asteroid belt may have been stunted by the presence
of Jupiter. 4) Self-interacting planetesimals feel dynamical friction from
other small bodies, which has important effects on the eccentricity evolution
and outcome of a simulation.

assume that water-rich material is accreted by terrestrial planets via impacts

analysis of water delivery and planetary habitability in five high-resolution
simulations containing about ten times more particles than in previous
simulations (Raymond et al 2006a, Icarus, 183, 265-282). These simulations
formed 15 terrestrial planets from 0.4 to 2.6 Earth masses, including five
planets in the habitable zone. Every planet from each simulation accreted at
least the Earth's current water budget; most accreted several times that amount
(assuming no impact depletion). Each planet accreted at least five water-rich
embryos and planetesimals from past 2.5 AU; most accreted 10-20 water-rich
bodies.
  We present a new model for water delivery to terrestrial planets in
dynamically calm systems, with low-eccentricity or low-mass giant planets --
such systems may be very common in the Galaxy. We suggest that water is
accreted in comparable amounts from a few planetary embryos in a ""hit or miss""
way and from millions of planetesimals in a statistically robust process.
Variations in water content are likely to be caused by fluctuations in the
number of water-rich embryos accreted, as well as from systematic effects such
as planetary mass and location, and giant planet properties.

type I migration -- due to the asymmetric torques produced by the interior and
exterior wakes raised by the body (Goldreich & Tremaine 1980; Ward 1986). This
presents a challenge for standard oligarchic approaches to forming the
terrestrial planets (Kokubo & Ida 1998) as the timescale to grow the progenitor
objects near 1 AU is longer than that for them to decay into the Sun. In this
paper we investigate the middle and late stages of oligarchic growth using both
semi-analytic methods (based upon Thommes et al. 2003) and N-body integrations,
and vary gas properties such as dissipation timescale in different models of
the protoplanetary disc. We conclude that even for near-nominal migration
efficiencies and gas dissipation timescales of ~1 Myr it is possible to
maintain sufficient mass in the terrestrial region to form Earth and Venus if
the disc mass is enhanced by factors of ~2-4 over the minimum mass model. The
resulting configurations differ in several ways from the initial conditions
used in previous simulations of the final stages of terrestrial accretion (e.g.
Chambers 2001), chiefly in (1) larger inter-embryo spacings, (2) larger embryo
masses, and (3) up to ~0.4 Earth masses of material left in the form of
planetesimals when the gas vanishes. The systems we produce are reasonably
stable for ~100 Myr and therefore require an external source to stir up the
embryos sufficiently to produce final systems resembling the terrestrial
planets.

SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) lines in a 0.9kpcx1.3kpc region around the nucleus of
IC342. The bulk of the line emission comes from a 290pc spiral arm and a r~80pc
nuclear ring. The distribution of SiO clouds is mostly anticorrelated with the
continuum emission at 87GHz, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung. The
SiO/H13CO+ intensity ratio increases by an order of magnitude from the nuclear
ring to the spiral arm. Furthermore the gas kinematics show significant
differences between SiO and H13CO+ over the spiral arm, where the linewidths of
SiO are 2 times larger than that of H13CO+. The average abundance of SiO in the
inner r~320pc, X(SiO)>2x10^{-10}, evidences that shock chemistry is at work in
IC342. We have compared the emission of SiO with another tracer of molecular
shocks: the emission of methanol (CH3OH). The significant difference of the
X(SiO) measured between the spiral arm (~a few 10^{-9}) and the nuclear ring
(~10^{-10}) is not echoed by a comparable variation in the SiO/CH3OH intensity
ratio. This implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in both
regions. In contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should be 5-7 times
larger in the spiral arm (up to ~10% of the available molecular gas mass over
the arm region) compared to the nuclear ring. We conclude that the large-scale
shocks revealed by the SiO map of IC342 are mostly unrelated with star
formation and arise instead in a pre-starburst phase. Shocks are driven by
cloud-cloud collisions along the potential well of the IC342 bar. The general
implications for the current understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.

not have any influence on the correlation, because the contribution of an

evolving the dynamical variables from the point of view of a local observer is
presented. No assumptions are made about the background metric and the design
is ready to be coupled with methods solving the full Einstein equations. In the
second part of the thesis important results concerning the understanding of
collisionless shocks, obtained from experiments with a relativistic charged
particle code, are presented. Relativistic collisionless shocks are important
in a range of astrophysical objects; in particular in gamma ray burst
afterglows and other relativistic jets. It is shown that a strong small scale,
fluctuating, and predominantly transversal magnetic field is unavoidably
generated by a two-stream instability. The magnetic energy density reaches a
few percent of equipartition. A new acceleration mechanism for electrons in
ion-electron collisionless shocks is proposed. The mechanism is capable of
creating a powerlaw electron distribution in a collisionless shocked region.
The non-thermal acceleration of the electrons is directly related to the ion
current channels generated by the two-stream instability and is local in
nature. Thus the observed radiation field may be tied directly to the local
conditions of the plasma and could be a strong handle on the physical
processes. (abridged)

difficult to explain within our current theoretical paradigm for planet
formation. Current data reveal that at least 25% of these planets, including
some with particularly high eccentricities, are orbiting a component of a
binary star system. The presence of a distant companion can cause significant
secular perturbations in the orbit of a planet. At high relative inclinations,
large-amplitude, periodic eccentricity perturbations can occur. These are known
as ""Kozai cycles"" and their amplitude is purely dependent on the relative
orbital inclination. Assuming that every planet host star also has a (possibly
unseen, e.g., substellar) distant companion, with reasonable distributions of
orbital parameters and masses, we determine the resulting eccentricity
distribution of planets and compare it to observations? We find that
perturbations from a binary companion always appear to produce an excess of
planets with both very high (e>0.6) and very low (e<0.1) eccentricities. The
paucity of near-circular orbits in the observed sample implies that at least
one additional mechanism must be increasing eccentricities. On the other hand,
the overproduction of very high eccentricities observed in our models could be
combined with plausible circularization mechanisms (e.g., friction from
residual gas) to create more planets with intermediate eccentricities

sequence, we study the color dependence of the composite spectra. Bluer
galaxies on the red sequence are found to have more young stars than red

by passive evolution of an old stellar population than by a model consisting of

J-Ks>1.5 mag and H-Ks>0.4 mag in the LMC, SMC, M31, and M33 from 2MASS data.
  Methods.The data were taken from the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalogue
archive. We used Virtual Observatory tools and took advantage of its
capabilities at various stages in the analysis.
  Results. It is well known that stars with the colors we selected correspond
mainly to carbon stars. Although the most luminous AGBs detected here contain a
large number of carbon stars,they are not included in existing catalogues
produced from data in the optical domain, where they are not visible since they
are dust-enshrouded. A comparison of the AGB stars detected with combined near
and mid-infrared data from MSX and 2MASS in the LMC shows that 10% of the
bright AGB stars are bright carbon stars never detected before and that the
other 50% are OH/IR oxygen rich stars, whereas the 40% that remain were not
cross-matched.
  Conclusions. The catalogues of the most luminous AGB stars compiled here are
an important complement to existing data. In the LMC, these bright AGB stars
are centrally located, whereas they are concentrated in an active
star-formation ring in M31. In the SMC and M33, there are not enough of them to
draw definite conclusions, although they tend to be centrally located. Their
luminosity functions are similar for the four galaxies we studied.

framework of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and within the framework of

reveal the inability of our numerical method to accommodate the equatorial
current sheets of pulsar magnetospheres and raise a question mark over the
robustness of this approach. On the other hand, the MHD approach allows to make
a significant progress. We start with a nonrotating magnetically dominated
dipolar magnetospheres and follow its evolution as the stellar rotation is
switched on. We find that the time-dependent solution gradually approaches the
steady state that is very close to the stationary solution of the Pulsar
Equation found by Contopoulos et al.(1999). This result suggests that other
stationary solutions that have the y-point located well inside the light
cylinder are unstable. The role of the particle inertia and pressure on the
structure and dynamics of MHD magnetospheres is studied in details, as well as
the potential implications of the dissipative processes in the equatorial
current sheet. We argue that pulsars may have differentially rotating
magnetospheres which develop noticeable structural oscillations and that this
may help to explain the nature of the sub-pulse phenomena.

has a number of globular clusters with bluer optical colors than expected for
their red optical to near-infrared colors and an old age. The only known way to
explain these colors is with a significant population of intermediate-age (2-8
Gyr) clusters in this elliptical galaxy. In contrast, NGC 1399 reveals no such
population. Our result for NGC 1399 is in agreement with previous spectroscopic
work that suggests that its clusters have a large metallicity spread and are
nearly all old. In the literature, there are various results from spectroscopic
studies of modest samples of NGC 4365 globular clusters. The spectroscopic data
allow for either the presence or absence of a significant population of
intermediate-age clusters, given the index uncertainties indicated by comparing
objects in common between these studies and the few spectroscopic candidates
with optical to near-IR colors indicative of intermediate ages. Our new near-IR
data of the NGC 4365 GC system with much higher signal-to-noise agrees well
with earlier published photometry and both give strong evidence of a
significant intermediate-age component. The agreement between the photometric
and spectroscopic results for NGC 1399 and other systems lends further
confidence to this conclusion, and to the effectiveness of the near-IR
technique.

characterized by peaks superposed on a slowly evolving pedestal, which in some
cases becomes less apparent at higher energies. We describe this behaviour with
the presence of two components (slow and fast) having different variability
time scales. We modelled the time evolution of slow components by means of an
analytical function able to describe asymmetric rising and decaying profiles.
The residual light curves, after the subtraction of the slow components,
generally show structures more similar to the original curves in the highest
energy band. Spectral study of these two components was performed evaluating
their hardness ratios, used also to derive photon indices. Slow components are
found generally softer than the fast ones suggesting that their origin is
likely different. Being typical photon indices lower than those of the
afterglows there is no evidence that the emission processes are similar.
Another interesting possibility is that slow components can be related to the
presence of a hot photosphere having a thermal spectrum with kT around a few
keV superposed to a rapid variable non-thermal emission of the fast component.

on the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed in the local

consistent with observations. The most successful models are all predicting a
peak of SN explosions soon after star formation and an extended tail in the

The full-Sun spectrum has a spectral resolution which allows an investigation

spectra as obtained, e.g. with FUSE or STIS/HST. The full-Sun spectrum shows
enhanced emission in the wings, and is well described by a double Gaussian fit

due to structures on the solar surface, especially those related to the

luminous cool stars shows that the line asymmetries of these stars might also
be a surface structure effect and not or only partly due to opacity effects in
their cool dense winds. These comparisons show the potential of high quality
full-Sun VUV spectra and their value for the study of solar-stellar
connections. As an example, this study proposes that alpha Cen A has a
considerably higher amount of magnetic flux concentrated in the chromospheric

magnetic field at the solar surface do not account for the radial structure and
the volume diffusion of the magnetic field. When considering the long-term
evolution of magnetic flux, this omission can lead to an unrealistic long-term
memory of the system and to the suppression of polar field reversals. In order
to avoid such effects, we propose an extension of the flux transport model by a
linear decay term derived consistently on the basis of the eigenmodes of the
diffusion operator in a spherical shell. A decay rate for each eigenmode of the
system is determined and applied to the corresponding surface part of the mode
evolved in the flux transport model. The value of the volume diffusivity
associated with this decay term can be estimated to be in the range 50--100
km^2/s by considering the reversals of the polar fields in comparison of flux
transport simulations with observations. We show that the decay term prohibits
a secular drift of the polar field in the case of cycles of varying strength,

boosted to finite velocity by a Galilei transformation. We discuss the dynamics
of the pattern formation and, briefly, the superimposed linear modes.
Implementing the stochastic interpretation we discuss kinetic transitions and
in particular the properties in the pair mode or dipole sector. We find the
Hurst exponent H=(3-d)/(4-d) for the random walk of growth modes in the dipole

we show that the upper critical dimension is d=4 in the sense that growth modes
cease to exist above this dimension.

LAr TPC with those provided by a magnetic field has been considered in the past
and has been shown to open new physics opportunities, in particular in the
context of a neutrino factory. The experimental operation of a magnetized 10 lt
LAr TPC prototype has been recently demonstrated. From basic proof of
principle, the main challenge to be addressed is the possibility to magnetize a
very large volume of Argon, corresponding to 10 kton or more, for future
neutrino physics applications. In this paper we present one such conceptual
design.

neutrino mass texture with a single phase parameter \delta that describes
maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and Dirac CP violation due to the presence
of \delta. The Majorana phase associated with the third massive neutrino turns
out to be identical to the Dirac phase while other Majorana phases vanish. The
nonvanishing reactor neutrino mixing angle \theta_{13} is induced by a \mu-\tau
symmetry breaking effect. Flavor neutrino masses that supply the \mu-\tau
symmetry breaking terms become pure imaginary for \delta=\pm \pi/2, leading to
maximal CP violation. There is a parameter denoted by \eta, which is either
O(\sqrt{\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_{atm}}) in the normal mass hierarchy, or
O(\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_{atm}) in the inverted mass hierarchy. In the
inverted mass hierarchy, the contribution of O(\sin^2\theta_{13}) is found to
be significant and cannot be neglected. Our texture also leads to quasi
degenerate neutrinos with masses of O(\sqrt{\Delta m^2_{atm}}), which serves as
the scale for the effective neutrino mass in (\beta\beta)_{0\nu}-decay. This
texture does not include \eta, and \Delta m^2_\odot naturally arises from
contributions of O(\sin^2\theta_{13}) to give \Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta
m^2_{atm}\sim\sin^2\theta_{13}, yielding the prediction of
\sin^2\theta_{13}=O(10^{-2}).

Ue(1)xUg(1) containing, one vector gauge field 'A' (photon) and one
pseudo-vector gauge field 'C' (pseudo-photon). By choosing a particular
solution of the equations of motion we obtain a functional description of
either field in terms of the other one. In this way we obtain non-trivial
configurations 'C=C(A)' or 'A=A(C)' such that, in the effective broken theories
containing only one gauge field, the usual field discontinuities in the
presence of both electric and magnetic monopoles are absent. These fields
regularity is achieved through corrections, inherited from the unbroken theory,
to the standard definitions of electromagnetic fields and four-currents. Based
in these results we also demonstrate non-triviality of the unbroken theory, in
the presence of both electric and magnetic four-currents, there are no trivial
solutions compatible with the equations of motion for both fields. Moreover we
demonstrate that, although in complete agreement with the Maxwell equations,
extended 'Ue(1)xUg(1)' electromagnetism is not equivalent to the standard
variational 'U(1)' Maxwell electromagnetism. We further show that the unbroken
theory is invariant under a combination of Hodge dualities that has as
self-dual point the field configuration corresponding to the zero-field
equation. In addition this condition has the particularity of being the only
configuration compatible with the mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking
proposed here that is also gauge invariant in the unbroken theory. These

found to decay with the Hubble constant ($H$) as, $\Lambda\propto H^4$. In this
scenario the cosmological constant varies quadratically with the energy density

a two-component cosmic fluid in the Universe. One of the component accelerated
the Universe in the early era, and the other in the present era. The scale

corrections to the BMN spectrum in an effective Landau-Lifshitz (LL) model
match with the results from the one-loop gauge theory, provided one chooses an
appropriate regularization. In this paper we continue this study for the
conjectured Bethe ansatz for the long range spin chain representing
perturbative planar N=4 Super Yang-Mills in the SU(2) sector, and the ``quantum
string"" Bethe ansatz for its string dual. The comparison is carried out for
corrections to BMN energies up to 3rd order in the effective expansion
parameter $\tl=\lambda/J^2$. After determining the ``gauge-theory'' LL action
to order $\tl^3$, which is accomplished indirectly by fixing the coefficients
in the LL action so that the energies of circular strings match with the
energies found using the Bethe ansatz, we find perfect agreement. We interpret
this as further support for an underlying integrability of the system. We then
consider the ``string-theory'' LL action which is a limit of the classical
string action representing fast string motion on an S^3 subspace of S^5 and
compare the resulting $\tl^3/J^2$ corrections to the prediction of the
``string'' Bethe ansatz. As in the gauge case, we find precise matching. This
indicates that the LL Hamiltonian supplemented with a normal ordering
prescription and zeta-function regularization reproduces the full superstring
result for the $1/J^2$ corrections, and also signifies that the string Bethe
ansatz does describe the quantum BMN string spectrum to order $1/J^2$. We also
comment on using the quantum LL approach to determine the non-analytic
contributions in $\lambda$ that are behind the strong to weak coupling
interpolation between the string and gauge results.

study on null polynomials is helpful to reduce congruences of higher degrees

functions over Z_m={0, ..., m-1} generated by integer polynomials. The most
well-known null polynomial is f(x)=x^p-x modulo a prime p.
  After pointing out that null polynomials modulo a composite can be studied by
handling null polynomials modulo each prime power, this paper mainly focuses on
null polynomials modulo p^d (d>=1). A typical monic null polynomial of the
least degree modulo p^d is given for any value of d>=1, from which one can
further enumerate all null polynomials modulo p^d. The most useful result
obtained in this paper are Theorem 32 in Sec. 4.4 and its derivative -- Theorem
34 in Sec. 4.5. The results given in Sec. 4.3 form a basis of the induction
proofs given in Sec. 4.4. However, if you do not care how the proofs in Sec.
4.4 were established, you can simply skip Sec. 4.3. Theorems 28 and 31 are very
important for the proof of Theorem 32 and should be paid more attention.

effective field theory of the nuclear many-body problem. Earlier work with this
effective theory exhibited EM couplings that are correct only to lowest order
in both the pion fields and the electric charge. The Lorentz-invariant
effective field theory contains nucleons, pions, isoscalar scalar (\sigma) and
vector (\omega) fields, and isovector vector (\rho) fields. The theory exhibits
a nonlinear realization of SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R chiral symmetry and has three
desirable features: it uses the same degrees of freedom to describe the
currents and the strong-interaction dynamics, it satisfies the symmetries of
the underlying QCD, and its parameters can be calibrated using
strong-interaction phenomena, like hadron scattering or the empirical
properties of finite nuclei. It has been verified that for normal nuclear
systems, the effective lagrangian can be expanded systematically in powers of
the meson fields (and their derivatives) and can be truncated reliably after
the first few orders. The complete EM lagrangian arising from minimal
substitution is derived and shown to possess the residual chiral symmetry of
massless, two-flavor QCD with EM interactions. The uniqueness of the minimal EM
current is proved, and the properties of the isovector vector and axial-vector
currents are discussed, generalizing earlier work. The residual chiral symmetry

corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC), both based on the log-likelihood function but also including a
penalty term that takes into account the number of independent observations and
of free parameters of each model. We compared the performance of different
models by varying the starting time Ts and the minimum magnitude threshold Mmin
for each sequence. We found that Omori-type models including parameter c are
preferable to those not including it, only for short Ts and low Mmin while the
latters generally perform better than the formers for Ts longer than a few
hours and Mmin larger than the main shock magnitude Mm minus 3 units. This
clearly indicates that a value of parameter c different from zero does not
represent a general property of aftershock sequences in California and Italy
but it is very likely induced in most cases by catalog incompleteness in the
first times after the main shock. We also considered other models of aftershock
decay proposed in the literature: the Stretched Exponential Law in two forms
(including and not including a time shift) and the band Limited Power Law
(LPL). We found that such models perform worse than the Modified Omori Model

allows to get the temporal dependance of the equations of motion of the
oscillator as a function of the non-linear coupling term. These equations are
the basis for the analysis of the stability. One find that the branch
associated to frequencies larger than the resonance is always stable whereas
the branch associated to frequencies smaller than the resonance exhibits two
stable domains and one unstable. This feature allows to re-interpret the
instabilities appearing in Tapping mode and may help to understand the reason

exploiting a coarse grained operation that gives the temporal dependence of the
nonlinear coupled equations of motion in amplitude and phase of the oscillator.
Stability criterions for the resonance peak are deduced and predict a stable
behavior of the oscillator in the vicinity of the resonance. The numerical
approach is based on results obtained with a virtual NC-AFM developped in our
group. The effect of the size of the stable domain in phase is investigated.
These results are in particularly good agreement with the theoretical
predictions. Also they show the influence of the phase shifter in the feedback

water film is always present on silica surfaces. If the surface is investigated
with a scanning probe method in Contact mode, this causes the formation of a
meniscus between the tip and the surface. This liquid neck generates additional
capillary forces between the nano-tip and the surface. In dynamic mode, due to
the action of the oscillating tip on the surface, the mechanical response of
the adsorbed water layers can induce additional dissipation that is probed
through the phase variations of the oscillator. In the present work, we analyze
by dynamic force microscopy the growth of a water film on a silica surface as a
function of time. The silica sample is first cleaned and heated at
$420^\circ$C, then is exposed to dry conditions. The influence of the water
film is checked with the dynamic mode by using intermittent contact and
noncontact situations. To describe the experimental observations, additional
dissipation is taken into account when the tip approaches the surface. The
results of the fits allow the evaluation of the dissipation induced by the
attractive interaction between the tip and the silica surface related to the
adsorption of water molecules on surface as a function of time. Results are
compared to previous tribological studies performed in Contact mode and
infra-red spectroscopy measurements on the silica for which the key parameter
was the surface temperature instead of time. The two experimental results are
in good agreement.

widely used in the field of scanning force microscopy. The aim of the present
work is to get analytical expressions describing the nonlinear dynamical
properties of the oscillator in noncontact and intermittent contact situations
in the tapping mode. Three situations are investigated: the pure attractive
interaction, the pure repulsive interaction, and a mixing of the two. The
analytical solutions obtained allow general trends to be extracted: the
noncontact and the intermittent contact show a very discriminate variation of
the phase. Therefore the measurement of the phase becomes a simple way to
identify whether or not the tip touches the surface during the oscillating
period. It is also found that the key parameter governing the structure of the
dynamical properties is the product of the quality factor by a reduced
stiffness. In the attractive regime, the reduced stiffness is the ratio of an
attractive effective stiffness and the cantilever one. In the repulsive regime,
the reduced stiffness is the ratio between the contact stiffness and the
cantilever one. The quality factor plays an important role. For large values of
the quality factor; it is predicted that a pure topography can be obtained
whatever the value of the contact stiffness. For a smaller quality factor, the
oscillator becomes more sensitive to change of the local mechanical properties.
As a direct consequence, varying the quality factor, for example with a vacuum
chamber, would be a very interesting way to investigate soft materials either
to access topographic information or nanomechanical properties.

propagation becomes ambiguous. Also, infinite bandwidth signals cannot
propagate through any real physical medium (whose transfer function is
therefore finite) without pulse distortion, which also leads to ambiguities in
determining propagation velocity during the tunneling process. In this
manuscript, we appoint some incompatibilities with the application of the
method of stationary phase in deriving tunneling times which, eventually, can
ruin the {\em superluminal} interpretation of transition times.
