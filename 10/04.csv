star has been observed with the ELODIE fiber-fed spectrograph as one of the
targets in our planet-search programme biased toward high-metallicity stars,
on-going since March 2004 at the Haute-Provence Observatory. An analysis of the
spectroscopic line profiles using line bisectors revealed no correlation
between the radial velocities and the line-bisector orientations, indicating
that the periodic radial-velocity signal is best explained by the presence of a
planet-mass companion. A linear trend is observed in the residuals around the
orbital solution that could be explained by the presence of a second companion
in a longer-period orbit. We also present here our orbital solution for another
slightly evolved star in our metal-rich sample, HD149143, recently proposed to
host a 4-d period Hot Jupiter by the N2K consortium. Our solution yields a
period P=4.09 days, a marginally significant eccentricity e=0.08 and a
planetary minimum mass of 1.36MJup. We checked that the shape of the spectral

begin by using the RXTE Slew Survey of the sky at |b|>10 to construct an X-ray
luminosity function (XLF) of nearby X-ray sources in the range
10^30<Lx(erg/s)<10^34 (where Lx is the luminosity over 2-10 keV), occupied by
coronally active binaries (ABs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs). We then extend
this XLF down to Lx~10^27.5 erg/s using the Rosat All-Sky Survey in soft X-rays
and available information on the 0.1-10 keV spectra of typical sources. We find
that the local cumulative X-ray (2-10 keV) emissivities (per unit stellar mass)
of ABs and CVs are (2.0+/-0.8)x10^27 and (1.1+/-0.3)x10^27 erg/s/Msol,
respectively. In addition to ABs and CVs, representing old stellar populations,
young stars emit locally (1.5+/-0.4)x10^27 erg/s/Msol. We finally attach to the
XLF of ABs and CVs a high luminosity branch (up to ~10^39 erg/s) composed of
neutron-star and black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), derived in
previous work. The combined XLF covers ~12 orders of magnitude in luminosity.
The estimated combined contribution of ABs and CVs to the 2-10 keV luminosity
of the Milky Way is ~2x10^38 erg/s, or ~3% of the integral luminosity of LMXBs
(averaged over nearby galaxies). The XLF obtained in this work is used
elsewhere (Revnivtsev et al.) to assess the contribution of point sources to
the Galactic ridge X-ray emission.

consists of two spatial components which can be identified with the bulge/bar
and the disk of the Galaxy. The parameters of these components determined from
X-ray data are compatible with those derived from near-infrared data. The
inferred ratio of X-ray to near-infrared surface brightness I(3-20 keV) (1e-11
erg/s/cm2/deg2)/I_(3.5micron)(MJy/sr)=0.26+/-0.05, and the ratio of X-ray to
near-infrared luminosity L_(3-20 keV)/L_(3-4 micron)=(4.1+/-0.3)e-5. The
corresponding ratio of the 3-20 keV luminosity to the stellar mass is
L_x/M_Sun=
  (3.5\pm0.5) 10^{27} erg/s, which agrees within the uncertainties with the
cumulative emissivity per unit stellar mass of point X-ray sources in the Solar
neighborhood, determined in an accompanying paper (Sazonov et al.). This
suggests that the bulk of the GRXE is composed of weak X-ray sources, mostly
cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries. The fractional
contributions of these classes of sources to the total X-ray emissivity
determined from the Solar neighborhood data can also explain the GRXE energy
spectrum. Based on the luminosity function of local X-ray sources we predict
that in order to resolve 90% of the GRXE into discrete sources a sensitivity
limit of ~10^{-16} erg/s/cm2 (2--10 keV) will need to be reached in future

relating to the evolution of galaxies. All of these results are consistent with
the ""downsizing"" concept of galaxy formation and evolution, i.e., that the
active periods of star formation moved progressively from very massive galaxies
at high redshift to much lower mass galaxies at the present epoch. Spectra of
massive red galaxies at z ~ 1.7 demonstrates that they contain old stellar
populations and hence must have formed their stars in the first ~3 Gyr of
cosmic history; indicators of star formation activity show that the star
formation rate in the most massive galaxies was much higher at z = 2 than
today, that the activity in intermediate mass galaxies peaked near z ~ 1.5,
while, since z ~ 1 the activity is primarily confined to lower mass galaxies.
The GDDS also uncovered a relatively high percentage of post-starburst galaxies
at z ~ 1, a result that is anticipated given all the activity seen at higher
redshifts. Measurements of the strengths of metal lines of a subsample of the
GDDS and CFRS galaxies at z ~ 0.7 reveal that, at a given mass, they had lower
metallicities than at present. The evolution in the mass-metallicity relation
is consistent with a model in which star formation lasts longest in less
massive galaxies, again an expected result in the downsizing scenario.

implementation of the so-called entrainment effect, whereby the flow of one
fluid imparts momentum in the other and vice versa. The mutual friction follows
by balancing the Magnus force that acts on the quantised neutron vortices with
a resistive force due to the scattering of electrons off of the magnetic field
with which each vortex core is endowed. We derive the form of the macroscopic
mutual friction force which is relevant for a model based on smooth-averaging
over a collection of vortices. We discuss the coefficients that enter the
expression for this force, and the timescale on which the two interpenetrating
fluids in a neutron star core are coupled. This discussion confirms that our
new formulation accords well with previous work in this area.

Despite of the large uncertainties in the latter selection method, the temporal

associated with SNe are found to predominantly (in $\sim$ 80% of the cases)
have single-peaked light curves, a softer spectrum (i.e. low energy power law
index $\alpha \sim$ --1.5) and tend not to follow the Lag-Luminosity and

properties point toward the existence of a significant number of

observational point of view -- a tail or a separate class with respect to the

typical parameters of classical T-Tauri stars, $\epsilon$ needs to be between a
few and a few tens of percent. In this scenario, efficient braking of the star

flares. Of the twelve light-curves examined, nine are beta-class and three are
alpha-class following the scheme of Belloni et al. (2000). In most cases, the
QPO frequency is most strongly correlated to the power law flux, which
partially contradicts some earlier claims that the strongest correlation is
between QPO frequency and blackbody flux. Seven beta-class curves are highly
correlated to blackbody features. In several cases, the QPO evolution appears
to decouple from the spectral evolution. We find that beta-class light-curves
with strong correlations can be distinguished from those without by their
``trigger spike'' morphology. We also show that the origin and strength of the
subsequent infrared flare may be causally linked to the variations in QPO
frequency evolution and not solely tied to the onset of soft x-ray flaring
behavior. We divide the twelve alpha- and beta-class light-curves into three
groups based on the evolution of the QPO, the morphology of the trigger spike,
and the infrared flare strength. An apparent crossover case leads us to
conclude that these groups are not unique modes but represent part of a
continuum of accretion behaviors. We believe the QPO behavior at the initiation
of the hard dip can ultimately be used to determine the terminating x-ray
behavior, and the following infrared flaring behavior.

favored viewing angle so as to cover the X-ray source but not the broad

limitations of the low S/N \chandra data. The new results strengthen our
earlier conclusions that the observed X-ray continua of red AGN are unusually
hard at energies >2 keV. Their observed spectra are consistent with
contributing significantly to the missing hard/absorbed population of the

constructed from emission-weighted mean temperature and intracluster medium
mass, X-ray luminosity, isophotal size, or near-IR luminosity show a separation
between cool core (CC) and non-cool core (NCC) clusters. We attribute this
partially to a temperature bias in CC clusters, and partially to other cool
core-related structural changes. We attempt to minimize CC/NCC separation in
scaling relations by applying a uniform scale factor to CC cluster temperatures
and determining the scale factor for each relation that minimizes the
separation between CC and NCC populations, and by introducing central surface
brightness as a third parameter in relations. The latter approach reduces
scatter in relations more than temperature scaling. We compare the scatter
within subsamples split by CC/NCC and morphological merger indicators. CC
clusters and clusters with less substructure generally exhibit higher scatter
about relations. The larger structural variations in CC clusters exit well
outside the core, suggesting that a process more global than core radiative
instability is at work. Simulations without cooling mechanisms also show no
correlation between substructure and larger scatter about relations, indicating
that any merger-related scatter increases are subtle. The results indicate that
cool core related phenomena, not merging processes, are the primary contributor
to scatter in scaling relations. Our analysis does not appear to support the
scenario in which clusters evolve cool cores over time unless they experience
major mergers. (Abridged)

compares their simulated light curves and combined colors with the

one needs to search, and allows one to determine the components' masses, radii

method in an automated program using published theoretical isochrones and
limb-darkening coefficients. Since it is easy to automate, this method lends
itself to systematic analyses of datasets consisting of photometric time series

angular momentum transfer in gaseous disks with finite thickness by a rotating
external potential. The disk is assumed to be isothermal in the vertical
direction and has no self-gravity. The disk perturbations are decomposed into
different modes, each characterized by the azimuthal index m and the vertical
index n, which specifies the nodal number of the density perturbation along the
disk normal direction. The n=0 modes correspond to the two-dimensional density
waves previously studied by Goldreich & Tremaine and others. In a
three-dimensional disk, waves can be excited at both Lindblad resonances (for
modes with n=0,1,2...) and vertical resonances (for the $n\ge 1$ modes only).
The torque on the disk is positive for waves excited at outer Linblad/vertical
resonances and negative at inner Lindblad/vertical resonances. While the n=0
modes are evanescent around corotation, the $n\ge 1$ modes can propagate into
the corotation region where they are damped and deposit their angular momenta.
We have derived analytical expressions for the amplitudes of different wave
modes excited at Lindblad and/or vertical resonances and the resulting torques
on the disk. It is found that for $n\ge 1$, angular momentum transfer through
vertical resonances is much more efficient than Lindblad resonances. This
implies that in some situations (e.g., a circumstellar disk perturbed by a
planet in an inclined orbit), vertical resonances may be an important channel
of angular momentum transfer between the disk and the external potential. We
have also derived new formulae for the angular momentum deposition at
corotation and studied wave excitations at disk boundaries.

characterized by very high star-formation rates (SFR>500 Msun/yr), and some of

star-formation activity is differential with assembled stellar mass and

first star clusters in a Lambda CDM cosmology under an isotropic UV background
radiation field, parametrized by J_21. We have investigated the problem in two
ways: a global radiation background and local radiative feedback surrounding
the first star clusters.
  Cooling in the first halos at high redshift is dominated by molecular
hydrogen, H_2 - we call these Generation 1 objects. At lower redshift and
higher virial temperature, T_vir > 10^4K, electron cooling dominates - we call
these generation 2. Radiation fields act to photo-dissociate H_2, but also
generate free electrons that can help to catalyse its production. At modest
radiation levels, J_{21}/(1+z)^3 ~ 10^{-12}-10^{-7}, the nett effect is to
enhance the formation of Generation 1 star-clusters. At higher fluxes the
heating from photo-ionisation dominates and halts their production. With a
realistic build-up of flux over time, the period of enhanced H_2 cooling is so
fleeting as to be barely discernable and the nett effect is to move primordial
star cluster formation towards Generation 2 objects at lower redshift. A
similar effect is seen with local feedback. Provided that enough photons are
produced to maintain ionization of their host halo, they will suppress the
cooling in Generation 1 halos and boost the numbers of primordial star clusters
in Generation 2 halos. Significant suppression of Generation~1 halos occurs for
specific photon fluxes in excess of about 10^{43} ph s^{-1} Msun^{-1}.

scale magnetic fields in fully convective objects like low-mass stars, brown
dwarfs and possibly gaseous planets. The dynamo process is of alpha^2 type and
thus differs from the shell-dynamo at work in more massive stars.The alpha^2
dynamo becomes supercritical for Rossby numbers Ro\la 10. It generates a
large-scale, non-axisymmetric, steady field that is symmetric with respect to
the equatorial plane. Saturation of the alpha^2-generated field at the
equipartition yields strengths of several kGauss, in agreement with
observations of active M dwarfs, and provides a qualitative explanation for the
observed activity saturation in late M stars. For brown dwarfs with a
conductive core, as occurs at the center of the most massive and oldest of
these objects, we have also studied an alpha^2-Omega dynamo, i.e. the effect of
differential rotation. In this case the field is predominantly toroidal,
axisymmetric and oscillatory, like the solar field. The topology of the field
in the fully convective objects exhibits a high order multipole character that
differs from the aligned dipole field generated by the alpha-Omega dynamo. The
strong reduction of the dipolar component due to the field non-axisymmetry
should considerably reduce the Alfven radius and thus the efficiency of
magnetic braking, providing an appealing explanation for the decreasing angular
momentum loss rate observed in low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. This may have
also implications for cataclysmic variables below the period gap. In spite of
this large-scale field, the decreasing conductivity in the dominantly neutral
atmosphere of these objects prevents the current generation necessary to
support a chromosphere and thus activity. (Abridged)

from quiescent to starburst cases. For four edge-on spiral galaxies, namely
NGC3044, NGC3221, NGC4634, and NGC5775, we present the first published high
resolution/sensitivity detections of extended soft X-ray halos. EPIC X-ray
contour maps overlaid onto Halpha imaging data reveals that in all cases the
presence of X-ray halos is correlated with extraplanar Diffuse Ionized Gas.
Moreover, these halos are also associated with non-thermal cosmic ray halos, as
evidenced by radio continuum observations. Supplemental UV-data obtained with
the OM-telescope at 210nm show Diffuse Ionized Gas to be well associated with
UV emission originating in the underlying disk. Beside NGC891, NGC4634 is the
second non-starburst galaxy with a diffuse soft X-ray halo (|z|<4kpc). In case
of NGC3877, for which we also present the first high resolution X-ray imaging

diffuse X-ray emission are extracted at different offset positions from the
disk, giving evidence to a significant decrease of gas temperatures, electron
densities, and gas masses with increasing distance to the plane. A comparison
between dynamical and radiative cooling time scales implies that the outflow in

emission by hot dust and by the presence of strong emission features generally
ascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, is the most
strongly affected by the heating processes associated with star formation
and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Following the detailed observational
characterization of galaxies in the MIR by ISO, we have updated the modelling
of this spectral region in our spectro-photometric model GRASIL (Silva et al.
1998). In the diffuse component we have updated the treatment of PAHs according
to the model by Li & Draine (2001). As for the dense phase of the ISM
associated with the star forming regions, the molecular clouds, we strongly
decrease the abundance of PAHs as compared to that in the cirrus, basing on the
observational evidences of the lack or weakness of PAH bands close to the newly
formed stars, possibly due to the destruction of the molecules in strong UV
fields. The robustness of the model is checked by fitting near infrared to
radio broad band spectra and the corresponding detailed MIR spectra of a large
sample of galaxies (Lu et al. 2003), at once. With this model, we have analyzed
the larger sample of actively star forming galaxies by Dale et al. (2000). We
show that the observed trends of galaxies in the ISO-IRAS-Radio color-color
plots can be interpreted in terms of different evolutionary phases of star
formation activity, and the consequent different dominance in the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the diffuse or dense phase of the ISM.

($0<\alpha\le 2$) focusing on the digital filtering of white noise. We detail
the formalism to conceive an efficient random number generator (white outside
some bounds) in order to generate very long streams of noise without an
exhaustive computer memory load. For $\alpha=2$ it is shown why the process is
equivalent to a random-walk and can be obtained simply by a first order
filtering of white noise. As soon as $\alpha<2$ the problem becomes non linear
and we show why the exact digital filtering method becomes inefficient.
Instead, we work out the formalism of using several 1/f^2 filters spaced
logarithmically, to approximate the spectrum at the percent level. Finally,
from work on logistic maps, we give hints on how to design generators with
$\alpha>2$. The software is available from

central radian since 2003, with the goal of both extracting a catalog of
sources and gaining insight into the Galactic diffuse emission. This paper
concentrates on the estimation of the total point sources emission
contribution. It is now clear that unresolved point sources contribute to the
observed diffuse emission; the increasing sensitivity of instruments with time
has lead to a steady decrease in estimates of this ``diffuse emission''.
  We have analysed the first year data obtained with the spectrometer and
imager SPI on board INTEGRAL. First, a catalog of 63 hard X-ray sources
detected, time-averaged, during our 2003 Galactic plane survey, is derived.
Second, after extracting the spectra of the sources detected by SPI, their
combined contribution is compared to the total (resolved and unresolved)
emission from the Galactic ridge. The data analysis is complex: it requires us
to split the total emission into several components, as discrete sources and
diffuse emission are superimposed in SPI data. The main result is that point
source emission dominates in the hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray domain, and
contributes around 90 % of the total emission around 100 keV, while above 250
keV, diffuse electron-positron annihilation, through its three-photon
positronium continuum with a positronium fraction $\sim$ 0.97 and the 511 keV
electron-positron line, dominates over the sources.

distinct from a perturbation series in the interparticle interactions. Some
generic properties of the wave function are studied, and its parameters in the

between the molecule and substrate laterally to a nanoscale region
significantly smaller in size than the molecule. The tip-molecule coupling and

used, coupling a single electronic level to a local phonon, forming polaron

formulation allows to derive rate equations. Assuming asymmetric tunneling
rates, and in the absence of the half-shuttle coupling, negative differential

the power and frequency bandwidth of THz radiation emitted from these devices
as a function of bias voltage, pump pulse duration and pump pulse location. We
show that the mechanisms limiting the THz power emitted from photoconductive
switches fall into two regimes: when illuminated with short duration (<40 fs)
laser pulses the energy distribution of the Gaussian pulses constrains the
emitted power, while for long (>40 fs) pulses, screening is the primary
power-limiting mechanism. A discussion of the dynamics of bias field screening
in the gap region is presented. The emitted terahertz power was found to be
enhanced when the exciting laser pulse was in close proximity to the anode of
the photoconductive emitter, in agreement with experimental results. We show
that this enhancement arises from the electric field distribution within the
emitter combined with a difference in the mobilities of electrons and holes.

was launched which replaces the infinite number of Hamiltonian constraints by a
single Master constraint. The MCP is designed to overcome the complications
associated with the non -- Lie -- algebra structure of the Dirac algebra of
Hamiltonian constraints and was successfully tested in various field theory
models. For the case of 3+1 gravity itself, so far only a positive quadratic
form for the Master Constraint Operator was derived. In this paper we close
this gap and prove that the quadratic form is closable and thus stems from a
unique self -- adjoint Master Constraint Operator. The proof rests on a simple
feature of the general pattern according to which Hamiltonian constraints in
LQG are constructed and thus extends to arbitrary matter coupling and holds for
any metric signature. With this result the existence of a physical Hilbert
space for LQG is established by standard spectral analysis.

resummed at next-to-leading-log accuracy. A matching condition for the crossing
of the bottom threshold in evolution is also implemented at next-to-leading

choices of a non-perturbative correction to the fixed-order initial condition
for the evolution, the data from CLEO and BELLE can be fitted with remarkable
accuracy. The fitted fragmentation function, when evolved to LEP energies, does
not however represent fairly the D* fragmentation spectrum measured by ALEPH.

However, the existence of a non-exact electromagnetic field always implies the
quantization of charges. Another consequence of the theory for spacetimes with
torsion is the fact that it gives rise to two natural quantization units that
could be identified with the electric quantization unit (realized inside the
quarks) and with the electron charge. In this framework the color charge can
have a topological origin, with the number of colors being related to the order
of the torsion subgroup. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the

the branes can naturally be trapped at a metastable minimum of the potential.
As branes tunnel out of this minimum, the shape of the potential changes to
make the minimum shallower. Eventually the minimum disappears and the remaining
branes roll slowly because the potential is nearly flat. I show that even with
a small number of branes, there is a good chance of getting enough inflation.
Running of the spectral index is correlated with the tilt in such a way as to
provide a test of the model by future CMB experiments.

dense in $C$. A complex-valued bounded function $f$ on $G$ is a Hartman

sections may be considered a many-channel many-resonance generalization of
Fano's original work on resonance lineshapes [Phys. Rev 124, 1866 (1961)].
  A statistical (random matrix) model is then introduced. It allows to describe
chaotic scattering systems with tunable couplings to the decay channels. We
focus on the autocorrelation function of the total (photo) cross section, and
we find that it depends on the same combination of parameters, as the
Fano-parameter distribution. These combinations are statistical variants of the
one-channel Fano parameter. It is thus possible to study Fano interference
(i.e. the interference between direct and indirect decay paths) on the basis of
the autocorrelation function, and thereby in the regime of overlapping
resonances. It allows us, to study the Fano interference in the limit of
strongly overlapping resonances, where we find a persisting effect on the level
of the weak localization correction.

dynamical equation derived in [J. Phys. A v.32, 5657 (1999)]. This equation
extends quantum dynamics to describe the time evolution in the case of
nonlocal-in-time interactions. We show that the use of the generalized
dynamical equation, which allows one to take into account that effective
actions in quantum field theory, arising after integrating out certain degrees
of freedom, are generally nonlocal, provides a new way to formulate the
effective theory of nuclear forces. In this way we construct the most general
possible operator describing the short-range part of the NN interaction in the
1S0 channel. In particular, this operator can be incorporated into the chiral
potential model. This is shown to provide an extension of the standard chiral
approach. Being equivalent to the chiral potential model for some values of the
constants characterizing the short-range of the NN interaction this approach
allows the solutions that cannot be reproduced by any potential model. In this
way we find that for certain values of the constants inconsistent with
potentials models the effect of the short-range forces on the half off-shell 2N
T-matrix with high off-shell momenta grows in magnitude rapidly as the kinetic
energy of outgoing protons decreases at laboratory energies below 15 MeV. We
show that this effect may be the origin of the existing discrepancy between the

applications, cannot be fullfilled with standard industrial processes (e.g. the
IBM C4 process), an in-house bump bond process using reflown indium bumps was
developed at PSI as part of the R&D for the CMS-pixel detector.
  The bump deposition on the sensor is performed in two subsequent lift-off
steps. As the first photolithographic step a thin under bump metalization (UBM)
is sputtered onto bump pads. It is wettable by indium and defines the diameter
of the bump. The indium is evaporated via a second photolithographic step with
larger openings and is reflown afterwards. The height of the balls is defined
by the volume of the indium. On the readout chip only one photolithographic
step is carried out to deposit the UBM and a thin indium layer for better
adhesion. After mating both parts a second reflow is performed for self
alignment and obtaining a high mechanical strength.
  For the placement of the chips a manual and an automatic machine was
constructed. The former is very flexible in handling different chip and module
geometries but has a limited throughput while the latter features a much higher
grade of automatisation and is therefore much more suited for producing
hundreds of modules with a well defined geometry.
  The reliability of this process was proven by the successful construction of
the PILATUS detector. The construction of PILATUS 6M (60 modules) and the CMS
pixel barrel (roughly 800 modules) will start in 2005.

researchers in bioinformatics often measure information using

decision-theoretic measures, such the value of information, which assess the
worth of information to a decision maker. Here we show that these two kinds of
measures are intimately related in the context of biological evolution. We
present a simple model of evolution in an uncertain environment, and calculate
the increase in Darwinian fitness that is made possible by information about
the environmental state. This fitness increase -- the fitness value of
information -- is a composite of both Shannon's mutual information and the
decision-theoretic value of information. Furthermore, we show that in certain
cases the fitness value of responding to a cue is exactly equal to the mutual
information between the cue and the environment. In general the Shannon entropy

systems with two degrees of freedom of which one degree of freedom is canonical
and the other a spin. Systems in this category include those involving
spin-orbit interactions and the Jaynes-Cummings model in which a single
electromagnetic mode interacts with many independent two-level atoms. We
construct a path integral representation for the propagator of such systems and
derive its semiclassical limit. As special cases we consider separable systems,
the limit of very large spins and the case of spin 1/2.

problems is presented, which is useful in situations where the evolution of the
Hamiltonian is slow. The state of a system which starts in an instantaneous
eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian is written as a power series which has a
straightforward diagrammatic representation. Each term of the series
corresponds to a sequence of ""adiabatic"" evolutions, during which the system
remains in an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, punctuated by
transitions from one state to another. The first term of this series is the
standard adiabatic evolution, the next is the well-known first correction to
it, and subsequent terms can be written down essentially by inspection.
Although the final result is perhaps not terribly surprising, it seems to be
not widely known, and the interpretation is new, as far as we know. Application
of the method to the adiabatic approximation is given, and some discussion of
the validity of this approximation is presented.

Specifically, in this paper, we investigate SARG04 with two-way classical
communications and SARG04 with decoy states. In the first part of the paper, we
show that SARG04 with two-way communications can tolerate a higher bit error
rate (19.4% for a one-photon source and 6.56% for a two-photon source) than
SARG04 with one-way communications (10.95% for a one-photon source and 2.71%
for a two-photon source). Also, the upper bounds on the bit error rate for
SARG04 with two-way communications are computed in a closed form by considering
an individual attack based on a general measurement. In the second part of the
paper, we propose employing the idea of decoy states in SARG04 to obtain
unconditional security even when realistic devices are used. We compare the
performance of SARG04 with decoy states and BB84 with decoy states. We find
that the optimal mean-photon number for SARG04 is higher than that of BB84 when
the bit error rate is small. Also, we observe that SARG04 does not achieve a
longer secure distance and a higher key generation rate than BB84, assuming a
typical experimental parameter set.

A73 (2006) 022328","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.022328",,"quant-ph",,"  We examine the problem of simulating lattice gauge theories on a universal
quantum computer. The basic strategy of our approach is to transcribe lattice
gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formulation into a Hamiltonian involving only
Pauli spin operators such that the simulation can be performed on a quantum
computer using only one and two qubit manipulations. We examine three models,
the U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) lattice gauge theories which are transcribed into a
spin Hamiltonian up to a cutoff in the Hilbert space of the gauge fields on the
lattice. The number of qubits required for storing a particular state is found
to have a linear dependence with the total number of lattice sites. The number
of qubit operations required for performing the time evolution corresponding to
the Hamiltonian is found to be between a linear to quadratic function of the
number of lattice sites, depending on the arrangement of qubits in the quantum
computer. We remark that our results may also be easily generalized to higher
SU(N) gauge theories.

quantum diffusion with one dimensional continuous observation is considered.The
a posteriori quantum state difusion in this case is reduced to a linear quantum
stochastic filter equation of Kalman-Bucy type and to the operator Riccati

describing a continuous collase to the stationary solution of the linear

outlined. It includes KMS processes in wide sense like the equilibrium finite
temperature quantum noise given by the Planck's spectral formula. It is shown
that for each stationary noise there exists a natural output process output
process which is identical to the noise in the infinite temperature limit, and
flipping with the noise if the time is reversed at finite temperature. A
canonical Hilbert space representation of the quantum noise and the fundamental
output process is established and a decomposition of their spectra is found. A
brief explanation of quantum stochastic integration with respect to the
input-output processes is given using only correlation functions. This provides
a mathematical foundation for linear stationary filtering transformations of
quantum stochastic processes. It is proved that the colored quantum stationary
noise and its time-reversed version can be obtained in the second order theory
by a linear nonadapted filtering of the standard vacuum noise uniquely defined
by the canonical creation and annihilation operators on the spectrum of the
input-output pair.

tantamount to a compression of the original image. The resulting algorithm can
be improved adding a discrete Fourier transform preprocessing and a further
entropic lossless compression.
