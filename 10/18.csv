of galaxies of different morphological type in presence of dust, we present our
description of the dust both in the diffuse ISM and the molecular clouds. Our
model for the dust takes into account three components, i.e. graphite,
silicates and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We consider and adapt to our
aims two prescriptions for the size distribution of the dust grains and two
models for the emission of the dusty ISM. We cross-check the emission and
extinction models of the ISM by calculating the extinction curves and the
emission for the typical environments of the Milky Way and the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds and by comparing the results with the observational data. The
final model we have adopted is an hybrid one which stems from combining the
analysis of Guhathakurta et al (1989) for the emission of graphite and
silicates and Puget et al. (1985) for the PAH emission, and using the
distribution law of Weingartner et al. (2001a) and the ionization model for
PAHs of Weingartner et al. (2001b). We apply the model to calculate the SED of
SSPs of different age and chemical composition, which may be severely affected
by dust in young, massive stars while they are still embedded in their parental
MCs. We use the ""Ray Tracing"" method to solve the problem of radiative transfer
and to calculate libraries of SSP SEDs. Particular care is paid to model the
contribution from PAHs, introducing different abundances of C in the population
of very small carbonaceous grains (VSGs) and different ionization states in
PAHs. The SEDs of young SSPs are then compared with observational data of star
forming regions of four local galaxies successfully reproducing their SEDs from
the UV-optical regions to the mid and far infrared.

distinguishing thin-disk, thick-disk, and halo populations. This is the largest
homogeneous sample of white dwarfs for which 3D space motions have been
determined. Since the percentage of old stars among white dwarfs is higher than
among main-sequence stars, they are presumably valuable tools in studies of old
populations, such as the halo and the thick disk. Radial velocities and
spectroscopic distances were combined with our measurements of proper motions
to derive 3D space motions. Galactic orbits were computed. Our kinematic
criteria for assigning population membership were deduced from a sample of F
and G stars, for which chemical criteria can be used to distinguish between a
thin-disk, a thick-disk and a halo star. Our kinematic population
classification scheme is based on the position in the U-V-velocity diagram, the
position in the Jz-eccentricity diagram, and the Galactic orbit. We combined
this with age information and found seven halo and 27 thick-disk white dwarfs
in this brightness limited sample. Correspondingly 2% of the white dwarfs
belong to the halo and 7% to the thick disk. The mass contribution of the
thick-disk white dwarfs is found to be substantial, but is insufficient to

decorrelation bandwidth of 160 MHz) of the observed variations jointly imply
that the component of the source exhibiting this scintillation must possess a
brightness temperature well in excess of the inverse Compton limit. A specific
model in which both the source and scintillation pattern are isotropic implies
a brightness temperature 0.5 x 10^13 z_{pc} K, where previous estimates place
the distance to the scattering medium in the range z_{pc}=4-12pc, yielding a
minimum brightness temperature >20 times the inverse Compton limit. An
independent estimate of the screen distance using the 21cm scintillation

which already reproduces the majority of observational constraints. We confirm
that barium is a neutron capture element mainly produced in the low mass AGB
stars during the thermal-pulsing phase by the 13C neutron source, in a slow
neutron capture process. However, in order to reproduce the [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
as well as the Ba solar abundance, we suggest that Ba should be also produced
as an r-process element by massive stars in the range 10-30 solar masses. On
the other hand, europium should be only an r-process element produced in the
same range of masses (10-30 solar masses), at variance with previous
suggestions indicating a smaller mass range for the Eu producers. As it is well
known, there is a large spread in the [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios at low
metallicities, although smaller in the newest data. With our model we estimate
for both elements (Ba and Eu) the ranges for the r-process yields from massive
stars which better reproduce the trend of the data. We find that with the same
yields which are able to explain the observed trends, the large spread in the
[Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios cannot be explained even in the context of an
inhomogeneous models for the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. We therefore
derive the amount by which the yields should be modified to fully account for
the observed spread. We then discuss several possibilities to explain the size
of the spread. We finally suggest that the production ratio of [Ba/Eu] could be
almost constant in the massive stars.

cusp can regrow at the center of a galaxy via energy exchange between stars
moving in the gravitational field of the single, coalesced hole. We illustrate
this process via high-accuracy N-body simulations. Regeneration requires
roughly one relaxation time and the new cusp extends to a distance of roughly
one-fifth the black hole's influence radius, with density rho ~ r^{-7/4}; the
mass in the cusp is of order 10% the mass of the black hole. Growth of the cusp
is preceded by a stage in which the stellar velocity dispersion evolves toward
isotropy and away from the tangentially-anisotropic state induced by the
binary. We show that density profiles similar to those observed at the center
of the Milky Way and M32 can regenerate themselves in several Gyr following
infall of a second black hole; the presence of density cusps at the centers of
these galaxies can therefore not be used to infer that no merger has occurred.
We argue that Bahcall-Wolf cusps are ubiquitous in stellar spheroids fainter

been detected outside of the Local Group since their angular sizes are less

background of speckles, a particular problem when detecting faint stellar
companions at small angular separations. Knowing the distribution of the
speckle intensities at a given location in the image plane is important for
understanding the noise limits of companion detection. The speckle noise limit
in a long-exposure image is characterized by the intensity variance and the
speckle lifetime. In this paper we address the former quantity through the
distribution function of speckle intensity. Previous theoretical work has
predicted a form for this distribution function at a single location in the
image plane. We developed a fast readout mode to take short exposures of
stellar images corrected by adaptive optics at the ground-based UCO/Lick
Observatory, with integration times of 5 ms and a time between successive
frames of 14.5 ms ($\lambda=2.2$ $\mu$m). These observations temporally
oversample and spatially Nyquist sample the observed speckle patterns. We show,
for various locations in the image plane, the observed distribution of speckle
intensities is consistent with the predicted form. Additionally, we demonstrate
a method by which $I_c$ and $I_s$ can be mapped over the image plane. As the
quantity $I_c$ is proportional to the PSF of the telescope free of random
atmospheric aberrations, this method can be used for PSF calibration and
reconstruction.

-8.3 to -8.8 dex, with HI column densities varying from 3-6x10^20 cm^-2. For
Magellanic Bridge gas, the values of A are 0.5 dex higher, ranging from -7.8 to

6cm wavelength were made with the Urumqi 25m telescope. The 6cm map is analysed
together with recently published maps from the Effelsberg 100m telescope at
21cm and 11cm. The integrated flux density of the Cygnus Loop at 6cm is
90+/-9Jy, which implies a spectral index of -0.40+/-0.06 being consistent with
that of Uyaniker et al. (2004) in the wavelength range up to 11cm. This rules
out any global spectral steepening up to 6cm. However, small spectral index
variations in some regions of the source are possible, but there are no
indications for any spectral curvature. The linear polarization data at 6cm
show percentage polarizations up to 35% in some areas of the Cygnus Loop,
exceeding those observed at 11cm. The Rotation Measure is around -21rad/m^2 in
the southern area, which agrees with previous observations. However, the
distribution of Rotation Measures is rather complex in the northern part of the
Cygnus Loop, where the 21cm emission is totally depolarized. Rotation Measures
based on 11cm and 6cm data are significantly larger than in the southern part.
The difference in the polarization characteristic between the northern and
southern part supports previous ideas that the Cygnus Loop consists of two
supernova remnants.

C2H2 in LMC carbon stars, suggestive of high carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios
at the low metallicity in the LMC. The low initial metallicity is also likely
to have resulted in less abundant HCN and CS. The sample of IR carbon stars
exhibits a range in C2H2:HCN abundance ratio. We do not find strong
correlations between the properties of the molecular atmosphere and

shapes of the absorption bands can be explained by differences in excitation
temperature. High mass-loss rates and strong pulsation would then be seen to be
associated with a large scale height of the molecular atmosphere.

identify three closely spaced periods around 4.810 hrs and a splitting of
+/-3%. The velocity - phase diagrams of the line-profile variations for the
distinct periods reveal characteristic prograde non-radial pulsation patterns
of high order corresponding to pulsation modes with l and m in the range 6-10.
The three pulsation modes have periods clearly shorter than the characteristic
pulsation time scale and show small horizontal velocity fields and hence are
identified as p-modes. The beating of the three pulsation modes leads to a
retrograde beat pattern with two regions of constructive interference
diametrically opposite on the stellar surface and a beat period of 162.8hrs
(6.8days). This beat pattern is directly observed in the spectroscopic time
series of the photospheric lines. The wind-sensitive lines display features of
enhanced emission, which appear to follow the maxima of the photospheric beat
pattern.

model parameters to be no larger than ~20% (disk scales) and ~10% (thick disk
normalization). While generally consistent with the above model, the density
distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations.
We detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at (R, Z) ~ (6.5, 1.5)kpc

Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and
may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging
with the Milky Way. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining

following preheating, the energy density associated with back-reaction is
sub-dominant and behaves as a tracker during the radiation era. At the onset of
matter domination, however, the effects of back-reaction begin to grow relative
to the matter density and the associated equation of state quickly approaches
that of a cosmological constant. Using standard values for the preheating

considered here is composed of two identical spatially-periodic saw-tooth-like

Such a behavior persists also in situations when the external force averages
out to zero. We demonstrate that the physics behind this phenomenon stems from
a particular behavior of fluctuations in random force: upon reaching a certain
level, random fluctuations exercise a locking function creating points of
irreversibility which the particle can not overpass. Repeated (randomly) in
each cycle, this results in a saltatory unidirectional drift. This mechanism
resembles the work of an escapement-type device in watches. Considering the

the interest brought in statistical mechanics of irreversible processes by the

based on the Helfand moment in order to calculate the viscosity properties in

the simplest system in which viscosity already exists: the two-hard-disk model.
The escape-rate formalism, establishing a direct relation between chaotic

logistic and generalized logistic map: the Feigenbaum attractor at the end of
the period doubling bifurcations; the tangent bifurcation at the border of the
period three window; the transition to chaos in the generalized logistic with
inflection 1/2 ($x_{n+1} = \mu x_{n}^{1/2}$), in which the main bifurcation
cascade, as well as the bifurcations generated by the periodic windows in the
chaotic region, collapse in a single point. The occupation number and the
Tsallis entropy are studied. The different regimes of convergence to the
attractor, starting from two kinds of far-from-equilibrium initial conditions,
are distinguished by the presence or absence of log-log oscillations, by
different power-law scalings and by a gap in the saturation levels. We show
that the escort distribution implicit in the Tsallis entropy may tune the
log-log oscillations or the crossover times.

the gel correlation length. In particular, extended fractal correlations may
occur during desorption, indicating the existence of a ramified cluster of

spanning from materials characterization to new devices like reading heads for
magnetically recorded media. A contrasted room temperature surface scan of a
100 microns wide 400 microns long bridge patterned into LSMO film provided
preliminary information about the film homogeneity. Then the temperature was
varied between 240 and 400 K, i.e. through the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic
transition. A clear relation between the MOR signal measured as function of the
temperature and the relative derivative of the resistivity up to the Curie
temperature was observed. This relationship is fundamental for the MOR
technique and its mechanism was explored in the particular case of LSMO.
Analysis in the framework of the Drude model showed that, within certain
conditions, the measured MOR signal changes are correlated to changes in the
charge carrier concentration.

model ontological knowledge (upstream of formal representation). The
methodology relies on a set of rigorously-defined modelling primitives and
principles. Its application leads to the elaboration of a semi-informal
ontology, which is independent of knowledge representation languages. We
recently enriched the OntoSpec methodology by endowing it with a new resource,
the DOLCE top-level ontology defined at the LOA (IST-CNR, Trento, Italy). The
goal of this integration is to provide modellers with additional help in
structuring application ontologies, while maintaining independence
vis-\`{a}-vis formal representation languages. In this report, we first provide
an overview of the OntoSpec methodology's general principles and then describe
the DOLCE re-engineering process. A complete version of DOLCE-OS (i.e. a

  To be able to handle such a highly dynamical situation in a simple manner we
make one significant physical restriction, that of spherical symmetry, and two
technical mathematical restrictions: (1) We choose to slice the spacetime in
such a way that the space-time foliations (and hence the horizons) are always
spherically symmetric. (2) Furthermore we adopt Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates
(which are well suited to the problem because they are nonsingular at the
horizon) in order to simplify the relevant calculations.
  We find particularly simple forms for surface gravity, and for the first and
second law of black hole thermodynamics, in this general evolving horizon
situation. Furthermore we relate our results to Hawking's apparent horizon,
Ashtekar et al's isolated and dynamical horizons, and Hayward's trapping
horizons. The evolving black hole model discussed here will be of interest,

study of neutrino physics to take stock of where the field is at the moment and
where it is going in the near and far future. Several working groups looked at
various aspects of this vast field. The summary was published as a main report
entitled ``The Neutrino Matrix'' accompanied by short 50 page versions of the
report of each working group. Theoretical research in this field has been quite
extensive and touches many areas and the short 50 page report provided only a
brief summary and overview of few of the important points. The theory
discussion group felt that it may be of value to the community to publish the
entire study as a white paper and the result is the current article. After a
brief overview of the present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and some
popular ways to probe the new physics implied by recent data, the white paper
summarizes what can be learned about physics beyond the Standard Model from the
various proposed neutrino experiments. It also comments on the impact of the
experiments on our understanding of the origin of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry of the Universe and the basic nature of neutrino interactions as well
as the existence of possible additional neutrinos. Extensive references to
original literature are provided.

critically reexamine aspects of neutrino equilibration and provide arguments to
suggest that neutrinos may equilibrate as mass eigenstates in the temperature
regime \emph{prior} to flavor equalization. We assume this to be the case, and
that neutrino mass eigenstates are in equilibrium with different chemical
potentials. Charged lepton self-energies are obtained to leading order in the
electromagnetic and weak interactions. The upper bounds on the neutrino
asymmetry parameters from CMB and BBN without oscillations, combined with the
fit to the solar and KamLAND data for the neutrino mixing angle, suggest that
for the two generation case there is resonant \emph{charged lepton} mixing in
the temperature range $T \sim 5 \mathrm{GeV}$. In this range the charged lepton
oscillation frequency is of the same order as the electromagnetic damping rate.

scalar multiplets supplemented by two Higgs fields in (1,3,1) and (1,1,3)

cosmologies with horizons, such as de Sitter space, or of eternal black holes,

vector theories in 2+1 dimensions. Specifically we examine a generalized
self-dual (GSD) model where a Maxwell term is added to the self-dual model. A
gauge embedding procedure applied to the GSD model leads to a
Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory with higher derivatives. We show that the
latter contains a ghost mode contrary to the original GSD model. On the other
hand, the same embedding procedure can be applied to $N_f$ fermions minimally
coupled to the self-dual model. The dual theory corresponds to $N_f$ fermions
with an extra Thirring term coupled to the gauge field via a Pauli-like term.
By integrating over the fermions at $N_f\to\infty$ in both matter coupled
theories we obtain effective quadratic theories for the corresponding vector
fields. On one hand, we have a nonlocal type of the GSD model. On the other
hand, we have a nonlocal form of the MCS theory. It turns out that both
theories have the same spectrum and are ghost free. By figuring out why we do
not have ghosts in this case we are able to suggest a new master action which
takes us from the local GSD to a nonlocal MCS model with the same spectrum of
the original GSD model and ghost free. Furthermore, there is a dual map between
both theories at classical level which survives quantum correlation functions
up to contact terms. The remarks made here may be relevant for other
applications of the master action approach.

multidimensional cut-off technique for calculating the Casimir energy of
massless scalar fields in $d$-dimensional rectangular spaces with $q$ large
dimensions and $d-q$ dimensions of length $L$ and generalize the technique to
arbitrary lengths. We explicitly evaluate the multidimensional remainder and

to obtain. Most importantly, we show that the division between analytical and
remainder is not arbitrary but has a natural physical interpretation. The
analytical part can be viewed as the sum of individual parallel plate energies
and the remainder as an interaction energy. In a separate procedure, via
results from number theory, we express some odd-dimensional homogeneous Epstein
zeta functions as products of one-dimensional sums plus a tiny remainder and
calculate from them the Casimir energy via zeta function regularization.

an infinite discrete group, having finite cyclic, dihedral, symmetric, and
other subgroups. Set of generators and generating relations of the group are
identified. Eigenvectors of regular honeycombs have been studied, and some of
them shown to correspond to Schlafli symbols of known integer regular polytopes
in 3 and 4 dimensions. It was discovered that group of all regular honeycombs
comprises subsets having eigenvectors inducing a metric of the (p, q)
signature, and in particular, (+---). These eigenvectors can be interpreted as
self-reproducing generalized regular polytopes (eigentopes).

terms of transfer properties of their classifying spaces. More precisely, we
consider the question posed by Haynes Miller, whether an equivalent theory can
be obtained by studying triples (f,t,X), where X is a p-complete, nilpotent
space with finite fundamental group, f is a map from the classifying space of a
finite p-group, and t is a stable retraction of f satisfying Frobenius
reciprocity at the level of stable homotopy. We refer to t as a retractive
transfer of f and to (f,t,X) as a retractive transfer triple over S.
  In the case where S is elementary abelian, we answer this question in the
affirmative by showing that a retractive transfer triple (f,t,X) over S does
indeed induce a p-local finite group over S with X as its classifying space.
  Conversely, we show that for a p-local finite group over any finite p-group
S, the natural inclusion of BS into the classifying space of the p-local finite
group has a retractive transfer t, making the triple consisting of the
inclusion, the retractive transfer and the classifying space of the p-local
finite group a retractive transfer triple over S. This also requires a proof,
obtained jointly with Ran Levi, that the classifying space of a p-local finite
group is a nilpotent space, which is of independent interest.

measuring the meshedness coefficient and counting short cycles (of three, four

cost. As normalization graphs, we consider both minimal spanning trees (MST)

$H(t)$ will likely violate those conditions.

of separable states follows the result that if a system is entangled at thermal
equilibrium for some temperature, then it presents a phase transition (PT)
where entanglement can be viewed as the order parameter. However, analyzing
different entanglement measures in the 2-qubit context, we see that different
entanglement quantifiers can indicate different orders for the same PT.
Examples are given for different Hamiltonians. Moving to the multipartite
context we show necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of
entanglement monotones to attest quantum phase transitions.

transitions, the stability of the ground state and the position-momentum
commutation relation [x,p]=ih, can only be explained by introducing radiation
reaction and vacuum electromagnetic fluctuation forces. Here we consider the
simple case of a nonrelativistic charged harmonic oscillator, in one dimension,
to investigate how to take into account the radiation reaction and vacuum
fluctuation forces within the Schrodinger picture. We consider the effects of
both classical zero-point and thermal electromagnetic vacuum fields. We show
that the zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations are dynamically related to the
momentum operator p=-ih d/dx used in the Schrodinger picture. Consequently, the
introduction of the zero-point electromagnetic fields in the vector potential
A_x(t) used in the Schrodinger equation, generates ``double counting'', as was
shown recently by A.J. Faria et al. (Physics Letters A 305 (2002) 322). We
explain, in details, how to avoid the ``double counting'' by introducing only
the radiation reaction and the thermal electromagnetic fields into the
Schrodinger equation.

positive trace increasing maps. The latter are realized by means of unitary
operators in Fock space extended by 2D vector spaces, physically identified

Further we present a different protocol called telecloning of entanglement,
which combines the many-to-many teleportation and nonlocal optimal asymmetric
cloning of an arbitrary entangled state. This scheme allows the optimal
transmission of the two nonlocal optimal clones of an entangled state to two
pairs of spatially separated receivers.
