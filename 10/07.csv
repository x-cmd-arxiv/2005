X-ray source (ULX) Holmberg II X-1, long thought to be the one of best
candidates for the missing class of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). Our
data comprises the first high quality XMM-Newton/RGS spectrum of an ULX, and an
XMM-Newton/EPIC spectrum with unprecedented signal-to-noise. A detailed timing
analysis shows that any variability on time-scales of minutes to hours is very
weak (< few per cent fractional rms), though larger amplitude variations on
much shorter time-scales could be hidden by photon counting statistics. This
result suggests that if Ho II X-1 harbours an IMBH, then we are observing this
source in a highly unusual and atypical state when compared with the known
variability behaviour of other accreting systems of large mass. Moreover unlike
Galactic X-ray binaries, our spectral analysis indicates the possible presence
of an optically-thick low temperature corona. Taken together our timing and
spectral analysis suggests that the compact companion is most-likely a high
luminosity analogue of black hole binary systems similar to GRS 1915+105, the
Galactic microquasar, harbouring a compact object of mass no greater than 100
solar masses.

assumption that there is pressure equilibrium between the radio-emitting plasma

Monte-Carlo simulation of the data led to the conclusion that there are not
enough bubbles present in the current sample to be able to determine the shape
of the population. An analysis of the ghost bubbles in our sample showed that
on the whole they have higher upper limits on k/f than the active bubbles,
especially when compared to those in the same cluster. A study of the Brightest
55 cluster sample shows that 17, possibly 20, clusters required some form of
heating as they have a short central cooling time, t_cool < 3 Gyr, and a large
central temperature drop, T_centre/T_outer< 1/2. Of these between 12 (70 per

view that the short-hard bursts arise from the merger of pairs of neutron
stars, or a neutron star merging with a stellar-mass black hole. The natural
timescales associated with these processes, however, essentially preclude an
X-ray flare lasting ~100 s. Here we show that an interaction between the GRB
outflow and a non-compact stellar companion at a distance of ~a light-minute
provides a natural explanation for the flares. In the model, the burst is
triggered by the collapse of a neutron star after accreting matter from the

distribution of delay times between formation and explosion, leading to an
association with both star-forming galaxies and old ellipticals.

pointed observations taken between early 1999 and late 2004 with RXTE and the
Ryle radio telescope. The X-ray spectra are remarkably well described by a
simple broken power law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Physically
motivated Comptonization models, e.g., compTT or eqpair, can reproduce this
simplicity. Broken power law models reveal a significant linear correlation
between the photon index of the lower energy power law and the hardening of the
power law at approximately 10keV. Comptonization models show that the
bolometric flux of a soft excess (e.g., disk component) is strongly correlated
with the compactness ratio of the Comptonizing medium. We also find that the
fraction of the time spent in low radio emission/soft X-ray spectral states has
increased from ~10% in 1996-2000 to ~34% since early 2000. Radio flares
typically occur during state transitions and failed state transitions. There is
also a strong correlation between the 10-50keV X-ray flux and the radio
luminosity of the source. We demonstrate that rather than there being
distinctly separated states, in contrast to the timing properties the spectrum
of Cyg X-1 shows variations between extremes of properties, with clear cut

value and redshift history of the equation of state parameter w, emphasizing
where these different observables are and are not complementary. Demonstrating
time-variability of w is difficult in most cases because dark energy is
dynamically insignificant at high redshift. Time-variability in which dark
energy tracks the matter density at high redshift and changes to a cosmological
constant at low redshift is {\it relatively} easy to detect. However, even a
sharp transition of this sort at z_c=1 produces only percent-level differences
in d(z) or D_1(z) over the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.8$, relative to the
closest constant-w model. Estimates of D_1(z) or H(z) at higher redshift,
potentially achievable with the Ly-alpha forest, galaxy redshift surveys, and
the CMB power spectrum, can add substantial leverage on such models, given
precise distance constraints at z < 2. The most promising routes to obtaining
sub-percent precision on dark energy observables are space-based studies of
Type Ia supernovae, which measure d(z) directly, and of weak gravitational
lensing, which is sensitive to d(z), D_1(z), and H(z).

Molecular Cloud using Bolocam at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. This
represents the largest millimeter or submillimeter continuum map of Perseus to
date. Our map covers more than 30,000 31"" (FWHM) resolution elements to a 1
sigma RMS of 15 mJy/beam. We detect a total of 122 cores above a 5 sigma point
source mass detection limit of 0.18 M_sun, assuming a dust temperature of 10 K,
60 of which are new millimeter or submillimeter detections. The 1.1 mm mass
function is consistent with a broken power law of slope -1.3 (0.5 M_sun<M<2.5
M_sun) and -2.6 (M>2.5 M_sun), similar to the local initial mass function
slope. No more than 5% of the total cloud mass is contained in discrete 1.1 mm
cores, which account for a total mass of 285 M_sun. We suggest an extinction
threshold for millimeter cores of Av~5 mag, based on our calculation of the
probability of finding a 1.1 mm core as a function of Av. Much of the cloud is
devoid of compact millimeter emission; despite the significantly greater area
covered compared to previous surveys, only 5-10 of the newly identified sources
lie outside previously observed areas. The two-point correlation function
confirms that dense cores in the cloud are highly structured, with significant
clustering on scales as large as 2e5 AU. These 1.1 mm results, especially when
combined with recently acquired c2d Spitzer Legacy data, will provide a census
of dense cores and protostars in Perseus and improve our understanding of the
earliest stages of star formation in molecular clouds.

(DNS) binary systems are a key target for the gravitational wave (GW)
interferometric detectors, such as LIGO, and the next generation detectors,
Advanced LIGO. The cumulative GW signal from DNS mergers in interferometric
data will manifest as ""geometrical noise"": a non-continuous stochastic
background with a unique statistical signature dominated by the spatial and
temporal distribution of the sources. Because geometrical noise is highly
non-Gaussian, it could potentially be used to identify the presence of a
stochastic GW background from DNS mergers. We demonstrate this by fitting to a
simulated distribution of transients using a model for the DNS merger rate and
idealized Gaussian detector noise. Using the cosmological ""probability event
horizon"" concept and recent bounds for the Galactic DNS merger rate, we
calculate the evolution of the detectability of DNS mergers with observation
time. For Advanced LIGO sensitivities and a detection threshold assuming
optimal filtering, there is a 95% probability that a minimum of one DNS merger
signal will be detectable from the ensemble of events comprising the stochastic
background during 12-211 days of observation. For initial LIGO sensitivities,
we identify an interesting regime where there is a 95% probability that at
least one DNS merger with signal-to-noise ratio > unity will occur during 4-68
days of observation. We propose that there exists an intermediate detection
regime with pre-filtered signal-noise-ratio less than unity, where the DNS
merger rate is high enough that the geometrical signature could be identified
in interferometer data.

Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECOs). The question would then arise why the
spinning BHCs do not reveal their spin pulsation unlike the spinning cold
Neutron Stars (NSs). Even for magnetized NSs with ``hard surfaces'', there may
be no observed spin pulsation if the dipole axis and spin direction are exactly
same. However, spinning ECOs do not show spin pulsation because their surface
gravitational red shift is extremely high, z >> 1 and could be in the range of
10^{7-8} for stellar mass range. In contrast NSs have z ~ 0.1 -0.3. The time
profile of periodic signals generated on the surface of a spinning MECO get
extremely distorted due to extreme general relativistic frame dragging effect
as they traverse through extremely steep gravitational field. However, if any
radiation would be formed in the ECO magnetosphere sufficiently away from the
surface like in the pulsar ``outer slots''(which may happen for isolated
spinning ECOs), it might be a pulsed one.

radius r_J, (2) an inner magnetized accretion disc below r_J driving (3) a non
relativistic self-collimated electron-proton jet surrounding, when adequate
conditions for pair creation are met, (4) a ultra relativistic
electron-positron beam. This accretion-ejection paradigm provides a simple
explanation to the canonical spectral states, from radio to X/gamma-rays, by
varying the transition radius r_J and disc accretion rate independently. Large
values of r_J and low accretion rate correspond to Quiescent and Hard states.
These states are characterized by the presence of a steady electron-proton MHD
jet emitted by the disc below r_J. The hard X-ray component is expect to form
at the jet basis. When r_J becomes smaller than the marginally stable orbit
r_i, the whole disc resembles a standard accretion disc with no jet,
characteristic of the Soft state. Intermediate states correspond to situations
where r_J ~ r_i. At large accretion rate, an unsteady pair cascade process is
triggered within the jet axis, giving birth to flares and ejection of
relativistic pair blobs. This would correspond to the luminous intermediate
state, with its associated superluminal motions.

seemingly contradictory mid-infrared spectroscopic and interferometric
observations of o Cet: the 11 micron sizes measured in the bandpass without any
salient spectral features are about twice as large as those measured in the
near-infrared. Our calculations of synthetic spectra show that the strong
absorption due to a number of optically thick H2O lines is filled in by the
emission of these H2O lines originating in the geometrically extended layers,
providing a possible physical explanation for the picture proposed by Ohnaka
(2004a) based on a semi-empirical modeling. This filling-in effect results in
rather featureless, continuum-like spectra in rough agreement with the observed
high-resolution 11 micron spectra, although the models still predict the H2O
lines to be more pronounced than the observations. The inverse P-Cyg profiles
of some strong H2O lines observed in the 11 micron spectra can also be
reasonably reproduced by our dynamical model atmospheres. The presence of the
extended H2O layers manifests itself as mid-infrared angular diameters much
larger than the continuum diameter. The 11 micron uniform-disk diameters
predicted by our dynamical model atmospheres are in fair agreement with those
observed with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI), but still somewhat
smaller than the observed diameters. We discuss possible reasons for this

series of high angular resolution (~0.1 arcsec) penumbra images. If these
motions trace true plasma motions, then we have detected converging flows that
arrange the plasma in long narrow filaments co-spatial with dark penumbral
filaments. Assuming that these flows are stationary, the vertical
stratification of the atmosphere and the conservation of mass suggest downflows
in the filaments of the order of 200 m/s. The association between downflows and
dark features may be a sign of convection, as it happens with the non-magnetic
granulation. Insufficient spatial resolution may explain why the estimated
vertical velocities are not fast enough to supply the radiative losses of
penumbrae.

stellar spheroidal components of galaxy clusters, which we call cluster
spheroids (CSphs) and which are typically one hundred times the size of normal
elliptical galaxies, lie on a ""fundamental plane"" as tight as that defined by
ellipticals (rms in effective radius of ~0.07), but that has a different slope.
The slope, as measured by the coefficient of the log(sigma) term, declines
significantly and systematically between the fundamental planes of ellipticals,
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and CSphs.We attribute this decline
primarily to a continuous change in M_e/L_e, the mass-to-light ratio within the
effective radius r_e, with spheroid scale. The magnitude of the slope change
requires that it arises principally from differences in the relative
distributions of luminous and dark matter, rather than from stellar population
differences such as in age and metallicity. By expressing the M_e/L_e term as a
function of sigma in the simple derivation of the fundamental plane and
requiring the behavior of that term to mimic the observed nonlinear
relationship between log(M_e/L_e) and log(sigma), we simultaneously fit a 2-D
manifold to the measured properties of dwarf ellipticals, ellipticals, BCGs,
and CSphs. The combined data have an rms scatter in log(r_e) of 0.114 (0.099
for the combination of Es, BCGs, and CSphs), which is modestly larger than each
fundamental plane has alone, but which includes the scatter introduced by
merging different studies done in different filters by different investigators.
This ``fundamental manifold'' fits the structural and kinematic properties of
spheroids that span a factor of 100 in sigma and 1000 in r_e. (ABRIDGED)

and baryon matter distributed in the early Universe, we advance here a
two-phase accretion scenario for forming supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with
masses around $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts $z (\gsim 6)$. The first
phase is conceived to involve a rapid quasi-spherical and quasi-steady Bondi
accretion of mainly SIDM particles embedded with baryon matter onto seed black
holes (BHs) created at redshifts $z\lsim 30$ by the first generation of massive
Population III stars; this earlier phase rapidly gives birth to significantly
enlarged seed BH masses of $M_{\hbox{\tiny BH},t_1}\backsimeq 1.4\times 10^6\
M_\odot \sigma_0/(1\hbox{cm}^2\hbox{g}^{-1})(C_s/30\hbox{km s}^{-1})^4$ during
$z\sim 20-15$, where $\sigma_0$ is the cross section per unit mass of SIDM
particles and $C_s$ is the velocity dispersion in the SIDM halo referred to as
an effective ""sound speed"". The second phase of BH mass growth is envisaged to
proceed primarily via baryon accretion, eventually leading to SMBH masses of
$M_{\hbox{\tiny BH}}\sim 10^9 M_\odot$; such SMBHs may form either by $z\sim 6$
for a sustained accretion at the Eddington limit or later at lower $z$ for
sub-Eddington mean accretion rates. We intend to account for the reported
detections of a few SMBHs at early epochs, e.g., SDSS 1148+5251 and so forth,
without necessarily resorting to either super-Eddington baryon accretion or
very frequent BH merging processes. Only extremely massive dark SIDM halos
associated with rare peaks of density fluctuations in the early Universe may
harbour such early SMBHs or quasars. Observational consequences are discussed.

of these stars in the ultraviolet generates a different photochemistry on these

longer lifetimes and higher mixing ratios than on Earth, making them
potentially observable by space-based telescopes. On the active M-star planets,
an ozone layer similar to Earth's was developed that resulted in a
spectroscopic signature comparable to the terrestrial one. The simultaneous
detection of O2 (or O3) and a reduced gas in a planet's atmosphere has been
suggested as strong evidence for life. Planets circling M stars may be good
locations to search for such evidence.

technique of wet chemical solution, have been investigated experimentally. The
sample sizes are 50 nm, 75 nm, and 150 nm with a typical length of a few
microns. The characterizations by XRD and TEM reveal that the samples consist
of Ni nano-particles forming one dimensional (1D) chain-like structure. The
magnetic properties have been investigated by FC, ZFC measurements and M-H
measurements. The results can be well explained within the context of
core-shell model. First of all, the freezing of disordered spins in the shell
layer have resulted in a peak-like structure on the ZFC curve. The peak
position occurs around TF ~ 13 K. With the 50 nm sample, the field dependent
behavior of TF(H) has been investigated in detail. It is well described by the
de Almeida-Thouless (AT) equation for the surface spin glass state. Secondly,
the shape anisotropy of 1D structure has caused a wide separation between the
FC and ZFC curves. This is mainly attributed to the blocking of the core
magnetism. Thirdly, by the M-H measurement in the low field region, the open
hysteresis loop measured at 5 K < TF is significantly enlarged in comparison
with that taken at T > TF. This indicates that a significant part of the
contribution to the magnetic irreversibility at T < TF is coming from the
disordered spins in the shell layer. Lastly, with reducing sample size, the
coercivity, HC, increases, whereas the saturation magnetization goes down
dramatically. These imply that, as the sample size reduces, the effect of shape
anisotropy becomes larger in the magnetization reversal process and the
contribution to the magnetism from the ferromagnetically ordered core becomes
smaller.

observed that around 1/8 Sr doping and independent of Nd concentration there
exists substantial disorder in the tilt pattern of the CuO_6 octahedra in both
the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases which persist down to 10 K and are
coupled to bond disorder in the cation layers. The weak magnitude of existing
charge/spin modulations in the Nd doped structure did not allow us to detect
specific Raman signatures on lattice dynamics or two-magnon scattering around

The construction is based on quasigroup string transformations. Since
quasigroups in general do not have algebraic properties such as associativity,

exponentially many readings from the lookup table that defines them (a Latin

neighbor of a query point in the high dimensional space, focusing on the
Euclidean space. The earlier approaches use locality-preserving hash functions
(that tend to map nearby points to the same value) to construct several hash
tables to ensure that the query point hashes to the same bucket as its nearest
neighbor in at least one table. Our approach is different -- we use one (or a
few) hash table and hash several randomly chosen points in the neighborhood of
the query point showing that at least one of them will hash to the bucket
containing its nearest neighbor. We show that the number of randomly chosen
points in the neighborhood of the query point $q$ required depends on the
entropy of the hash value $h(p)$ of a random point $p$ at the same distance
from $q$ at its nearest neighbor, given $q$ and the locality preserving hash
function $h$ chosen randomly from the hash family. Precisely, we show that if
the entropy $I(h(p)|q,h) = M$ and $g$ is a bound on the probability that two
far-off points will hash to the same bucket, then we can find the approximate
nearest neighbor in $O(n^\rho)$ time and near linear $\tilde O(n)$ space where
$\rho = M/\log(1/g)$. Alternatively we can build a data structure of size
$\tilde O(n^{1/(1-\rho)})$ to answer queries in $\tilde O(d)$ time. By applying
this analysis to the locality preserving hash functions in and adjusting the
parameters we show that the $c$ nearest neighbor can be computed in time
$\tilde O(n^\rho)$ and near linear space where $\rho \approx 2.06/c$ as $c$
becomes large.

background-independent formulation (the rest-frame instant form of tetrad

imply the existence of an asymptotic flat metric. By switching off the Newton

Minkowski theories. The problem of the objectivity of the space-time

proceeds via Bogoliubov transformations, and yields probabilities for final
outcomes. In our (complex) approach, we find quantum amplitudes, not just
probabilities, by following Feynman's $+i\epsilon$ prescription. Initial and
final data for Einstein gravity and (say) a massless scalar field are specified
on a pair of asymptotically-flat space-like hypersurfaces $\Sigma_I$ and
$\Sigma_F$; both are diffeomorphic to ${\Bbb R}^3$. Denote by $T$ the (real)
Lorentzian proper-time interval between the surfaces, as measured at spatial
infinity. Then rotate: $T\to{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\theta),0<\theta\leq \pi/2$.
The {\it classical} boundary-value problem is expected to be well-posed on a
region of topology $I\times{\Bbb R}^3$, where $I$ is a closed interval. For a
locally-supersymmetric theory, the quantum amplitude should be dominated by the
semi-classical expression $\exp(iS_{\rm class})$, where $S_{\rm class}$ is the
classical action. One finds the Lorentzian quantum amplitude from the limit
$\theta\to 0_+$. In the usual approach, the only possible such final surfaces
are in the strong-field region shortly before the curvature singularity. In our
approach one can put arbitrary smooth gravitational data on $\Sigma_F$,
provided that it has the correct mass $M$ -- the singularity is by-passed in
the analytic continuation. Here, we consider Bogoliubov transformations and
their possible relation to the probability distribution and density matrix in
the traditional approach. We find that our probability distribution for
configurations of the final scalar field cannot be expressed in terms of the
diagonal elements of some non-trivial density-matrix distribution.

renormalisation is given, including the cancellation of infrared divergences in
intermediate diagrams. The result was checked by evaluation in three separate
gauges and by two authors independently, showing the incredible flexibility and
power of this perturbative methodology. Our preliminary result for the two-loop
perturbative matching factor, and of systematic errors associated with
higher-orders, gives \msbar masses at a 2 GeV scale of $m_s = 87(0)(4)(4)(0)$
MeV, and $\frac12(m_u+m_d) = 3.3(0)(2)(2)(0)$ MeV, where the respective
uncertainties are from lattice statistical, lattice systematic, perturbative,
and electromagnetic and isospin effects. The perturbative errors are a factor
of two smaller than in our previous study, and we anticipate reducing this
somewhat further from additional analysis of the systematics.

necessary to determine the value of dm^2_31 with a sufficient accuracy. The
nu_mu survival events, which can be accumulated simultaneously with the nu_e
appearance events, can serve for this purpose owing to its large statistics.
Therefore, the combined analysis of nu_e appearance and nu_mu survival events
is crucial to provide a restrictive constraint on deltaCP. Taking a test
experimental setup, we demonstrate in the deltaCP-dm^2_31 plane that the
analysis of nu_e appearance events leads to less restrictive constraints on the
value of deltaCP due to the ambiguity of dm^2_31 and that the combined analysis
efficiently improves the constraints.

from the definition of SUSY. In the sfermion -> Goldstino + fermion vertex
change: 1. the spin of sparticle with discrete 1/2, 2. the Grassman superspace
with the Goldstino shift operator. 3. the spacetime as the result of extra
dimensional leap.
  The leap nature of SUSY transformations appears in the squark decay, it is
the analog definition of SUSY. The quantum leaped outgoing propagators are
determined and break locally the energy and the charge. Like to the
teleportation the entangled pairs are here the b quark and the Goldstino. The
dominant stop production is from gluons. The stop-antistop pair decay to
quantum leaped b (c or t) quark, and the decay break the color. I get for the
(color breaking) quantum leap: 10^-18 m !!! And 10^-11 m color breaking would
be needed for a color breaking chain reaction. The open question is: Are the
colliders going to produce supersymmetry charge? Because some charges in QGP
can make long color breaking and a chain reaction.
  A long color broken QGP state in the re-Big Bang theory could explain the
near infinite energy and the near infinite mass of the universe: - at first was
random color QGP in the flat space-time, - at twice the color restoration in
the curved space-time, which eats the Goldstinos, - and finally the baryon
genesis. The re Big Bang make a supernova like collapse and a flat explosion of
Universe.
  This explanation of SUSY hides the Goldstone fermion in the extra dimensions,
the Goldstino propagate only in superspace and it is a not observable dark

circle? One motivation for considering this is to give insight into the fairly
inscrutable Virtual Fibration Conjecture. For the special class of 3-manifolds
with tunnel number one, we provide compelling theoretical and experimental
evidence that fibering is a very rare property. Indeed, in various precise
senses it happens with probability 0. Our main theorem is that this is true for
a measured lamination model of random tunnel number one 3-manifolds.
  The first ingredient is an algorithm of K Brown which can decide if a given
tunnel number one 3-manifold fibers over the circle. Following the lead of
Agol, Hass and W Thurston, we implement Brown's algorithm very efficiently by
working in the context of train tracks/interval exchanges. To analyze the
resulting algorithm, we generalize work of Kerckhoff to understand the dynamics
of splitting sequences of complete genus 2 interval exchanges. Combining all of
this with a ""magic splitting sequence"" and work of Mirzakhani proves the main
theorem.
  The 3-manifold situation contrasts markedly with random 2-generator 1-relator
groups; in particular, we show that such groups ""fiber"" with probability
strictly between 0 and 1.

differential forms. But in contrast to the exterior forms, the basis of
evolutionary forms is deforming manifolds (with unclosed metric forms). Such
forms possess a peculiarity, namely, the closed inexact exterior forms are
obtained from that.
  The closure conditions of inexact exterior form (vanishing the differentials
of exterior and dual forms) point out to the fact that the closed inexact
exterior form is a quantity conserved on pseudostructure having the dual form
as the metric form. We obtain that the closed inexact exterior form and
corresponding dual form made up a conservative object, i.e. a quantity
conserved on pseudostructure. Such conservative object corresponds to the
conservation law and is a differential-geometrical structure.
  Transition from the evolutionary form to the closed inexact exterior form
describes the process of generating the differential-geometrical structures.
This transition is possible only as a degenerate transformation, the condition
of which is a realization of a certain symmetry.
  Physical structures that made up physical fields are such
differential-geometrical structures. And they are generated by material systems
(medias). Relevant symmetries are caused by the degrees of freedom of material
system.

capacity. Mutual coupling becomes more pronounced as array aperture shrinks and
is therefore a critical issue in compact array design. Two novel compact arrays
are designed and fabricated for use in MIMO enabled mobile devices. These
arrays are extremely compact yet demonstrate acceptable mutual coupling and
radiation efficiency because of the MIMO-specific criteria used during their
design. An experimental methodology is presented for fair and meaningful
characterization of MIMO arrays by field trial. This methodology addresses the
issue of capacity normalization and quantifies how well an antenna array's

from an extensive measurement campaign in which a true MIMO transceiver testbed

when separation of time scales is not well pronounced. We derive a family of

occurrence of nests in two wetlands on Lake Erie, Ohio in 1995 and 1996. The
second model was developed to predict breeding success in two marshes in
Connecticut, USA in 1969 and 1970. Independent variables were vegetation
durability, stem density, stem/nest height, distance to open water, distance to
edge, and water depth. With input variable relevances, sensitivity analyses and
neural interpretation diagrams we were able to understand how the different
models predicted nest occurrence and breeding success and compare their
differences and similarities. Both models also predicted increasing nest
occurrence/breeding success with increasing water depth under the nest and
increasing distance to edge. However, relationships for prediction differed in
the models. Generalizability of the models was poor except when the marshes had
similar values of important variables in the model. ANN models performed better
than generalized linear models (GLM) on marshes with similar structures.
Generalizability of the models did not differ in nest occurrence and breeding
success data. Extensive testing also showed that the GLMs were not necessarily
more generalizable than ANNs, suggesting that ANN models make good definitions
of a study system but are too specific to generalize well to other ecologically
complex systems unless input variable distributions are very similar.
