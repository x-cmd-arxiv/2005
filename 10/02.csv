been obtained for a sub-sample of 38 mergers and combined with previously
obtained infrared photometry to test whether mergers exhibit the same
correlations as elliptical galaxies among parameters such as stellar luminosity
and distribution, central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$$_{\circ}$), and
metallicity. Paramount to the study is to test whether mergers lie on the
Fundamental Plane. Measurements of $\sigma$$_{\circ}$ have been made using the
Ca triplet absorption line at 8500 {\AA} for all 38 mergers in the sub-sample.
Additional measurements of $\sigma$$_{\circ}$ were made for two of the mergers
in the sub-sample using the CO absorption line at 2.29 $\micron$. The results
indicate that mergers show a strong correlation among the parameters of the
Fundamental Plane but fail to show a strong correlation between
$\sigma$$_{\circ}$ and metallicity (Mg$_{2}$). In contrast to earlier studies,
the $\sigma$$_{\circ}$ of the mergers are consistent with objects which lie
somewhere between intermediate-mass and luminous giant elliptical galaxies.
However, the discrepancies with earlier studies appears to correlate with
whether the Ca triplet or CO absorption lines are used to derive
$\sigma$$_{\circ}$, with the latter almost always producing smaller values.
Finally, the photometric and kinematic data are used to demonstrate for the
first time that the central phase-space density of mergers are equivalent to
elliptical galaxies. This resolves a long-standing criticism of the merger
hypothesis.

the opacity of the boundary layer, which results in the opacity to be high in

led to unprecedented insights into the energetics of the explosion and nature
of the progenitors. Yet short of the detection of a smoking gun, like a burst
of coincident gravitational radiation or a Li-Paczynski mini-supernova, it is
unlikely that a definitive claim can be made for the progenitors. As was the
case with long--duration soft--spectrum GRBs, however, the expectation is that
a systematic study of the hosts and the locations of short GRBs could begin to
yield fundamental clues about their nature. We present the first aggregate
study of the host galaxies of short--duration hard--spectrum GRBs. In
particular, we present the Gemini--North and Keck discovery spectra of the
galaxies that hosted three short GRBs and a moderate--resolution (R~6000)
spectrum of a fourth host. We find that these short--hard GRBs originate in a
variety of low-redshift (z<1) environments that differ substantially from those
of long--soft GRBs, both on individual galaxy scales and on galaxy--cluster
scales. Specifically, three of the bursts are found to be associated with old
and massive galaxies with no current (< 0.1 Msol/hr) or recent star formation.
Two of these galaxies are located within a cluster environment. These
observations support an origin from the merger of compact stellar remnants,
such as double neutron stars of a neutron star--black hole binary. The fourth
event, in contrast, occurred within a dwarf galaxy with a star formation rate
exceeding 0.5 Msol/yr. Therefore, it appears that like supernovae of Type Ia,
the progenitors of short--hard bursts are created in all galaxy types,
suggesting a corresponding class with a wide distribution of delay times
between formation and explosion.

technique by analysing experimental data for welds in thin sheet of a nickel

prediction and the measurement results without the necessity of using iterative
solution. In practice complete characterisation of residual stress states is
often very difficult, due to limitations of facility access, measurement time

  Physics",,,,"math-ph cond-mat.stat-mech math.MP",,"  We present a mathematically rigorous analysis of the ground state of a
dilute, interacting Bose gas in a three-dimensional trap that is strongly
confining in one direction so that the system becomes effectively
two-dimensional. The parameters involved are the particle number, $N\gg 1$, the
two-dimensional extension, $\bar L$, of the gas cloud in the trap, the
thickness, $h\ll \bar L$ of the trap, and the scattering length $a$ of the
interaction potential. Our analysis starts from the full many-body Hamiltonian
with an interaction potential that is assumed to be repulsive, radially
symmetric and of short range, but otherwise arbitrary. In particular, hard
cores are allowed. Under the premisses that the confining energy, $\sim 1/h^2$,
is much larger than the internal energy per particle, and $a/h\to 0$, we prove
that the system can be treated as a gas of two-dimensional bosons with
scattering length $a_{\rm 2D}= h\exp(-(\hbox{\rm const.)}h/a)$. In the
parameter region where $a/h\ll |\ln(\bar\rho h^2)|^{-1}$, with $\bar\rho\sim
N/\bar L^2$ the mean density, the system is described by a two-dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii density functional with coupling parameter $\sim Na/h$. If
$|\ln(\bar\rho h^2)|^{-1}\lesssim a/h$ the coupling parameter is $\sim N
|\ln(\bar\rho h^2)|^{-1}$ and thus independent of $a$. In both cases
Bose-Einstein condensation in the ground state holds, provided the coupling
parameter stays bounded.

performance measures that span multiple network paths. Unfortunately, forming
such network-wide measures can be difficult, due to the issues of scale
involved. In particular, the number of paths grows too rapidly with the number
of endpoints to make exhaustive measurement practical. As a result, it is of
interest to explore the feasibility of methods that dramatically reduce the
number of paths measured in such situations while maintaining acceptable
accuracy.
  We cast the problem as one of statistical prediction--in the spirit of the
so-called `kriging' problem in spatial statistics--and show that end-to-end
network properties may be accurately predicted in many cases using a
surprisingly small set of carefully chosen paths. More precisely, we formulate
a general framework for the prediction problem, propose a class of linear
predictors for standard quantities of interest (e.g., averages, totals,
differences) and show that linear algebraic methods of subset selection may be
used to effectively choose which paths to measure. We characterize the
performance of the resulting methods, both analytically and numerically. The
success of our methods derives from the low effective rank of routing matrices
as encountered in practice, which appears to be a new observation in its own
right with potentially broad implications on network measurement generally.

second serotype leads to serious illness accompanied by greater infectivity. It
has been observed from serotype data of dengue hemorrhagic fever that outbreaks
of the four serotypes occur asynchronously. Both autonomous and seasonally
driven outbreaks were studied in a model containing ADE. For sufficiently small
ADE, the number of infectives of each serotype synchronizes, with outbreaks
occurring in phase. When the ADE increases past a threshold, the system becomes
chaotic, and infectives of each serotype desynchronize. However, certain
groupings of the primary and second ary infectives remain synchronized even in
the chaotic regime.

in the number of transactions and to a lesser extent their size, are the main
cause of clustered volatility. Under this view bursts of rapid or slow price
diffusion reflect bursts of frequent or less frequent trading, which cause both
clustered volatility and heavy tails in price returns. We investigate this
hypothesis using tick by tick data from the New York and London Stock Exchanges
and show that only a small fraction of volatility fluctuations are explained in
this manner. Clustered volatility is still very strong even if price changes
are recorded on intervals in which the total transaction volume or number of
transactions is held constant. In addition the distribution of price returns
conditioned on volume or transaction frequency being held constant is similar
to that in real time, making it clear that neither of these are the principal
cause of heavy tails in price returns. We analyze recent results of Ane and
Geman (2000) and Gabaix et al. (2003), and discuss the reasons why their
conclusions differ from ours. Based on a cross-sectional analysis we show that
the long-memory of volatility is dominated by factors other than transaction
frequency or total trading volume.

which exhibits chaotic itinerancy among the different stored patterns or

which continuously destabilize the attractor and induce irregular hopping to
other possible attractors. The nature of the resulting irregularity depends on
the dynamic details, namely, on the intensity of the synaptic noise and on the
number of sites of the network that are synchronously updated at each time
step. Varying these details, different regimes occur from regular to chaotic.
In the absence of external agents, the chaotic behavior may turn regular after
tuning the noise intensity. It is argued that a similar mechanism might be at
the origin of the self-control of chaos in natural systems.
