evolution of galaxies. In this context, X-ray deep fields provide information
about some of the most energetic cosmological objects: active galactic nuclei
(AGN). Astronomers are interested in detecting sufficient numbers of AGN to
probe the accretion history at high redshift. This talk gives an overview of
the knowledge resulting from a highly complete soft X-ray selected sample
collected with ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Chandra deep fields. The principal outcome
based on X-ray luminosity functions and space density evolution studies is that
low-luminosity AGN evolve in a dramatically different way from high-luminosity
AGN: The most luminous quasars perform at significantly earlier cosmic times
and are most numerous in a unit volume at cosmological redshift z~2. In
contrast, low-luminosity AGN evolve later and their space density peaks at
z~0.7. This finding is also interpreted as an anti-hierarchical growth of
supermassive black holes in the Universe. Comparing this with star formation
rate history studies one concludes that supermassive black holes enter the
cosmic stage before the bulk of the first stars. Therefore, first solutions of
the so-called hen-egg problem are suggested. Finally, status developments and
expectations of ongoing and future extended observations such as the XMM-COSMOS
project are highlighted.

an accretion disc wind. Indeed, whilst we cannot confirm the possibility that
the companion star is visible at certain phase combinations, it is possible
that all supergiant-like features observed thus far are produced solely in a
wind. We conclude that great care must be taken when interpreting the behaviour

projected rotational velocities for a large sample of mainly B-type stars in
young clusters to study the time evolution of the rotational properties of
massive stars. The survey is based upon moderate resolution spectra made with
the WIYN 3.5 m and CTIO 4 m telescopes and Hydra multi-object spectrographs,
and the target stars are members of 19 young open clusters with an age range of
approximately 6 to 73 Myr. We made fits of the observed lines He I 4026, 4387,
4471 and Mg II 4481 using model theoretical profiles to find projected
rotational velocities for a total of 496 OB stars. We find that there are fewer
slow rotators among the cluster B-type stars relative to nearby B stars in the
field. We present evidence consistent with the idea that the more massive B
stars (M > 9 solar masses) spin down during their main sequence phase. However,
we also find that the rotational velocity distribution appears to show an
increase in the numbers of rapid rotators among clusters with ages of 10 Myr
and higher. These rapid rotators appear to be distributed between the zero age
and terminal age main sequence locations in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram,
and thus only a minority of them can be explained as the result of a spin up at
the terminal age main sequence due to core contraction. We suggest instead that
some of these rapid rotators may have been spun up through mass transfer in
close binary systems.

a circumstellar disk. The masers further from HW2 have field strengths between
30-100 mG. In all cases the magnetic field pressure is found to be similar to
the dynamic pressure, indicating that the magnetic field is capable of
controlling the outflow dynamics around HW2. In addition to several water maser
complexes observed before, we also detect a new maser filament, ~1 arcsec (~690

to mark the transition between the magnetic field associated with the outflow

periodic (7.5 hours) brightness variation with a very small amplitude (0.07
mag). This KBO may be nearly spherical, a result that might not be unusual in
the Kuiper Belt but would be remarkable among outer Solar System satellites of
similar size. We carry out a study of possible physical states and bulk
densities under the assumptions of both fluid equilibrium and finite, non-zero
internal friction. The densities for the these KBOs are likely to be in the
range 1--2 g/cm3, and a plausible solution for 2000 FV53 is a rubble pile of
this density that is held slightly out of the minimum-energy shape by internal
friction among constituent blocks that are relatively small. Our interpretation
of 2000 FV53 as a pulverized but essentially primordial object and 2003 BF91 as

signature of this orbit was previously detected by the HIPPARCOS satellite in
the form of curvature in the proper motion components, although the period was
unknown at the time. By combining our radial velocity measurements with the
HIPPARCOS intermediate data (abscissae residuals) we are able to derive the
full three-dimensional orbit, and determine the dynamical mass of the unseen
companion as well as a revised trigonometric parallax that accounts for the
orbital motion. Given our primary mass estimate of 0.73 solar masses (mid-K
dwarf), the companion mass is determined to be 0.89 solar masses, or about 20%
larger than the primary. The likely explanation for the larger mass without any
apparent contribution to the light is that the companion is itself a closer
binary composed of M dwarfs. The near-infrared excess and X-ray emission
displayed by HIP 50796 support this. Our photometric modeling of the excess
leads to a lower limit to the mass ratio of the close binary of about q = 0.8,
and individual masses of 0.44-0.48 solar masses and 0.41-0.44 solar masses. The
new parallax (20.6 +/- 1.9 mas) is significantly smaller than the original

from homogeneous HII region, ionised stellar wind and shock ionised gas, are

region, the radius of the emitting region is constrained to be <~ 26 AU
corresponding to a temperature >~ 2,500 K, which is consistent with the
reported radio and H-alpha emission. In the ionised stellar wind picture, our
upper limit of radio emission translates to the ratio of mass loss rate and
terminal velocity, (M_dot/v_infinity) < 1.2-1.8 x 10^(-10) (M_sun/yr)/(km/s).
On the other hand, if the stellar wind shocks the dense neutral (molecular)
cloud, the radio upper limit implies that the fraction of the wind encountering
the dense obstacle is <50%. Based on a recent measurement of X-ray outburst and
later monitoring, the expected radio emission has been estimated. Using our
radio limit, the radius (<~ 36 AU) and electron density (>~ 7.2 x 10^7 cm^(-3)

aggregating particles with a steady monomer source. We emphasise the case of
low spatial dimensions where strong diffusive fluctuations invalidate the
mean-field description provided by standard Smoluchowski kinetic theory. The
presence of a source of monomers allows the system to reach a statistically
stationary state at large times. This state is characterised by a constant flux
of mass directed from small to large masses. It admits a phenomenological
description based on the assumption of self-similarity and constant mass flux
analogous to the Kolmogorov's 1941 theory of turbulence. Unlike turbulence, the
aggregation problem is analytically tractable using powerful methods of
statistical field theory. We explain in detail how these methods should be
adapted to study the far-from-equilibrium, flux-dominated states characteristic
of turbulent systems. We consider multipoint correlation functions of the mass
density. By an exact evaluation of the scaling exponents for the one and
two-point correlation functions, we show that the assumption of
self-similiarity breaks down at large masses for spatial dimensions, $d\leq2$.
We calculate non-rigourously the exponents of the higher order correlation
functions as an $\epsilon$-expansion where $\epsilon=2-d$. We show that the
mass distribution exhibits non-trivial multiscaling. An analogy can be drawn
with the case of hydrodynamic turbulence. The origin of this multiscaling is
traced to strong correlations between particles participating in large mass
aggregation events. These correlations stem from the recurrence of diffusion
processes in $d\leq2$.

the problem translates to that of passive scalars in a Burgers fluid. We study
the case of particles moving in the same direction as the surface, equivalent
to advection in fluid language. Monte-Carlo simulations on a discrete lattice
model reveal extreme clustering of the passive particles. The resulting Strong
Clustering State is defined using the scaling properties of the two point
density-density correlation function. Our simulations show that the state is
robust against changing the ratio of update speeds of the surface and

one obtains the Sinai model for random walkers on a random landscape. In this

Rutile resonators avoid these problems while retaining comparable sensitivity

in the vicinity of the moving contact line, where the interface separating two
immiscible fluids intersects the solid wall. Decades ago it was already known
that the moving contact line is incompatible with the no-slip boundary
condition, since the latter would imply infinite dissipation due to a
non-integrable singularity in the stress near the contact line. In this paper
we first present an introductory review of the problem. We then present a

boundary condition governing the moving contact line, denoted the generalized
Navier boundary condition. We have used this discovery to formulate a continuum
hydrodynamic model whose predictions are in remarkable quantitative agreement

affirm the validity of the generalized Navier boundary condition, as well as to
open up the possibility of continuum hydrodynamic calculations of immiscible

molecules. In contrast, for a broad resonance the interaction between the atoms
is approximately pointlike and microscopic molecules are irrelevant. The bosons
represent now correlated atom pairs or composite ``dressed molecules''. The low
temperature results agree with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our formalism
can treat with general inhomogeneous situations in a trap. For not too strong
inhomogeneities the detailed properties of the trap are not needed for the
computation of the fluctuation effects - they enter only in the solutions of
the field equations.

first-principles method to predict the electronic structure of solids with high
accuracy. Here we present an approach which we call the quasiparticle
self-consistent GW approximation (QpscGW). It is based on a kind of
self-consistent perturbation theory, where the self-consistency is constructed
to minimize the perturbation. We apply it to selections from different classes
of materials, including alkali metals, semiconductors, wide band gap
insulators, transition metals, transition metal oxides, magnetic insulators,
and rare earth compounds. Apart some mild exceptions, the properties are very
well described, particularly in weakly correlated cases. Self-consistency
dramatically improves agreement with experiment, and is sometimes essential.
Discrepancies with experiment are systematic, and can be explained in terms of
approximations made.

even dimensions, a massless ingoing null naked singularity emerges. In odd
dimensions, meanwhile, a massive timelike naked singularity forms. These naked
singularities can be globally naked if the ingoing null dust fluid is switched
off at a finite time; the resulting spacetime is static and asymptotically
anti-de Sitter spacetime. The curvature strength of the massive timelike naked

hierarchy (or, equivalently, of the brane-to-brane distance) can be understood
as an implementation of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This mechanism relies on
the non-trivial bulk profile of the so-called Goldberger-Wise scalar, which in
addition has fixed expectation values at the boundaries and thereby stabilizes
the size of the 5d interval. The Goldberger-Wise scalar is realized
microscopically by the continuously varying flux of the Neveu-Schwarz 2-form
potential B_2 on the S^2 cycle in the throat. Its back-reaction on the 5d

find that, for a wide range of parameters, the universal Kaehler modulus of the

specific binding site in the center of the cell. There is no need for a
straightforward simulation of this process. Instead, an alternative and exact
approach is shown to be essentially faster than explicit random-walk
simulations. The speed-up of this novel simulation technique is rapidly growing

the 64 codons (GF(64)) was recently presented. Now, in order to include
deletions and insertions (indel mutations), we have defined a new Galois field
over the set of elements X1X2X3 (C125), where Xi belong to {O, A, C, G, C}. We
have called this set, the extended triplet set and the elements X1X2X3, the
extended triplets. The order of the bases is derived from the Z64-algebra of
the genetic code -recently published-. Starting from the natural bijection phi:
GF(5^3)-> C125 between the polynomial representation of elements from GF(5^3)
and the elements X1X2X3, a novel Galois field over the set of elements X1X2X3
is defined. Taking the polynomial coefficients a0, a1, a2 belong to GF(5) and
the bijective function f: GF(5) ->{O, A, C, G, C}, where f(0) = O, f(1) = A,
f(2) = C, f(3) = G, f(4) = U, bijection phi is induced such that phi(a0 + a1x +
a2x^2) = (f(a1), f(a2), f(a0)) = (X1X2X3). Next, by means of the bijection phi
we define sum ""+"" and product ""*"" operations in the set of codons C125, in such
a way that the resultant field (C125, +, *) turns isomorphic to the Galois
Field GF(5^3). This field allows the definition of a novel N-dimensional vector
space (S) over the field GF (5^3) on the set of all 125^N sequences of extended
triplets in which all possible DNA sequence alignments of length N are
included. Here the ""classical gap"" produced by alignment algorithms corresponds
to the neutral element ""O"". It is verified that the homologous (generalized)
recombination between two homologous DNA duplexes involving a reciprocal
exchange of DNA sequences -e.g. between two chromosomes that carry the same
genetic loci- algebraically corresponds to the action of two automorphism pairs
(or two translation pairs) over two paired DNA duplexes.

mechanisms that prevent their representation as pure pairwise interactions
between a transcription factor and its target(s). These include, among others,
transcription factor activation by phosphorylation and acetylation, formation
of active complexes with one or more co-factors, and mRNA/protein degradation
and stabilization processes.
  This paper presents a first step towards the systematic, genome-wide
computational inference of genes that modulate the interactions of specific
transcription factors at the post-transcriptional level. The method uses a
statistical test based on changes in the mutual information between a
transcription factor and each of its candidate targets, conditional on the
expression of a third gene. The approach was first validated on a synthetic
network model, and then tested in the context of a mammalian cellular system.
By analyzing 254 microarray expression profiles of normal and tumor related
human B lymphocytes, we investigated the post transcriptional modulators of the
MYC proto-oncogene, an important transcription factor involved in
tumorigenesis. Our method discovered a set of 100 putative modulator genes,
responsible for modulating 205 regulatory relationships between MYC and its
targets. The set is significantly enriched in molecules with function
consistent with their activities as modulators of cellular interactions,
recapitulates established MYC regulation pathways, and provides a notable
repertoire of novel regulators of MYC function. The approach has broad
applicability and can be used to discover modulators of any other transcription
factor, provided that adequate expression profile data are available.

solution with finite-size spatio-temporal support inside which the quantum
amplitude satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation with finite {\it emergent} mass.
We then proceed to interpret the soliton wave function as describing a particle
with finite mass, energy and momentum. Inside the spatio-temporal support, the
wave function shows spatio-temporal internal vibration with angular frequency
and wave number that are determined by the energy-momentum of the particle as
firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Imposing resonance of the internal vibration
inside the spatio-temporal support leads to Planck-Einstein quantization of
energy-momentum. The first resonance mode is shown to recover the classical
energy-momentum relation developed in special relativity. We further show that
the linearity of the Schr\""odinger equation allows one to construct many
solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with
various masses, energies and momenta.

developed the concept of generalized CSs. As it can be observed the customary
three generalization methods {\it (symmetry, algebraic and dynamical)} have
never been considered in neither of them. Our intention in this work is at
first to investigate the lost ring between the customary three methods and the
recently developed ones, as possible. For this purpose it has been devised
general analytic descriptions, which successfully demonstrate how different
varieties of CSs (which are nonlinear in nature) can be obtained by two
processes, first the {\it ""nonlinear CSs""} method and second by {\it ""basis
transformations on an underlying Hilbert spaces""}. As a result, I will
systematize the recently introduced generalized CSs in a clear and concise way.
It will be clear also, that how our results can be considered as a first step
in the generation process of the mathematical physics CSs in the context of
quantum optics. Besides this, some new results emerge from our studies. I
introduce a large classes of generalized CSs, namely the {\it ""dual family""}
associated with each set of early known CSs. But, in this relation, the
previous processes for constructing the dual pair of Gazeau-Klauder CSs fail to
work well, so I outlined a rather different method based on the {\it ""temporal
stability""} requirement of generalized nonlinear CSs.
