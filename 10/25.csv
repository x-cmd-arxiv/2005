star (NS) surface modes. Simple approximations demonstrate that it depends most
strongly on the bursting NS surface temperature. This result compares well with
full integrations that include Doppler shifts from rotation and general
relativistic corrections to photon propagation. We show that the energy
dependence of type I X-ray burst oscillations agrees with that of a surface
mode, lending further support to the hypothesis that they originate from
surface waves. The energy dependence of the pulsed emission is rather
insensitive to the NS inclination, mass and radius, or type of mode, thus
hindering constraints on these parameters. We also show that, for this
energy-amplitude relation, the majority of the signal (relative to the noise)
comes in the 2-25 keV band, so that the current burst oscillation searches with
the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer are close to optimal. The critical test of the
mode hypothesis for X-ray burst oscillations would be a measurement of the
energy dependence of burst oscillations from an accreting millisecond pulsar.

gamma-ray repeaters (SGR), based on the onset of colour superconductivity in
quark stars. In this model, the bursts result from the reorganization of the
exterior magnetic field following the formation of vortices that confine the
internal magnetic field (the \mz effect). Here we extend the model by
presenting full 3-dimensional simulations of the evolution of the inclined
exterior magnetic field immediately following vortex formation. The simulations
capture the violent reconnection events in the entangled surface magnetic field
as it evolves into a smooth, more stable, configuration which consists of a
dipole field aligned with the star's rotation axis. The total magnetic energy
dissipated in this process is found to be of the order of $10^{44}
\mathrm{erg}$ and, if it is emitted as synchrotron radiation, peaks typically
at $280 \mathrm{keV}$. The intensity decays temporally in a way resembling SGRs
and AXPs (anomalous X-ray pulsars), with a tail lasting from a few to a few
hundred times the rotation period of the star, depending on the initial
inclination between the rotation and dipole axis. One of the obvious
consequences of our model's final state (aligned rotator) is the suppression of
radio-emission in SGRs and AXPs following their bursting era. We suggest that
magnetar-like magnetic field strength alone cannot be responsible for the
properties of SGRs and AXPs, while a quark star entering the ``Meissner phase''
is compatible with the observational facts. We compare our model to
observations and highlight our predictions.

these sources. Their soft thermal spectrum, believed to originate directly from
the star surface, shows evidence for a phase-varying absorption line at some
hundred eVs. The pulse modulation is relatively large (pulsed fractions in the
range ~12%-35%), the pulse shape is often non-sinusoidal, and the hard X-ray
color appears to be anti-correlated in phase with the total emission. Moreover,
the prototype of this class, RX J0720.4-3125, has been found to undergo rather
sensible changes both in its spectral and timing properties over a timescale of
a few years. All these new findings seem difficult to reconcile with the
standard picture of a cooling neutron star endowed with a purely dipolar
magnetic field, at least if surface emission is produced in an atmosphere on
top of the crust. In this paper we explore how a dipolar+quadrupolar
star-centered field influence the properties of the observed lightcurves. The
phase-resolved spectrum has been evaluated accounting for both radiative
transfer in a magnetized atmosphere and general relativistic ray-bending. We
computed over 78000 lightcurves varying the quadrupolar components and the

  The BH masses are correlated against a variety of nuclear and host-galaxy

high degree of correlation with BH mass. The excellent correlation with
line-width supports the view that the emission-line gas is in virial
equilibrium with either the BH or bulge potential. The very good emission-line
ratio correlations may indicate a change in ionizing continuum shape with BH
mass in the sense that more massive BHs generate harder spectra.
  Apart from the inclination-corrected rotational velocity, no excellent
correlations are found between BH mass and host-galaxy properties.
  Significant differences are found between the distributions of BH masses in
early-, mid- and later-type spiral galaxies in the sense that early-type
galaxies have preferentially larger central BHs. The line-width distributions
show a marked difference among the subsamples in the sense that earlier-type
galaxies have larger line widths. There are also clear differences in line
ratios between subsamples likely related to the level of ionization in the gas.

X-ray emission in neutron star X-ray binaries, use this to infer the general
properties of the disc-jet coupling in such systems, and compare the results
quantitatively with those already established for black hole systems. There are
clear qualitative similarities between the two classes of object: hard states
below about 1% of the Eddington luminosity produce steady jets, while transient
jets are associated with outbursting and variable sources at the highest
luminosities. However, there are important quantitative differences: the
neutron stars are less radio-loud for a given X-ray luminosity (regardless of
mass corrections), and they do not appear to show the strong suppression of
radio emission in steady soft states which we observe in black hole systems.
Furthermore, in the hard states the correlation between radio and X-ray
luminosities of the neutron star systems is steeper than the relation observed
in black holes by about a factor of two. This result strongly suggests that the
X-ray emission in the black hole systems is radiatively inefficient, with an
approximate relation of the form L_X \propto \dot{m}^2, consistent with both
advection-dominated models and jet-dominated scenario. On the contrary the jet
power in both classes of object scales linearly with accretion rate. This
constitutes some of the first observational evidence for the radiatively
inefficient scaling of X-ray luminosity with accretion rate in accreting black
hole systems.

generally attributed to a hot comptonizing medium, such as a corona above the
accretion disk. At smaller energies the continuum displays an excess with
respect to the extrapolation of this power law, called the ``soft X-ray
excess"". Until now it was attributed, either to reflection of the hard X-ray
source by the accretion disk, or to the presence of an additional comptonizing
medium. An alternative solution proposed by Gierli\'nski & Done (2004) is that
a single power law represents correctly both the soft and the hard X-ray
emission, and the soft X-ray excess is an artefact due to the absorption of the
primary power law by a relativistic wind. We examine the advantages and
drawbacks of the reflection versus absorption models. We argue that in the
absorption hypothesis, the absorbing medium should be in total pressure
equilibrium, to constrain the spectral distribution which otherwise would be
too strongly variable in time and from one object to the other, as compared to
observations. We conclude that some X-ray spectra, in particular those with
strong soft X-ray excesses, can be modelled by absorption in the 0.3-10 keV
range. However, due to the lack of a complete grid of models and good data
extending above 10 keV, we are not able to conclude presently that all objects
can be accommodated with such models. These absorption models imply either
strong relativistic outflowing winds with mass rates of the order of the
Eddington value (or even larger), or quasi-spherical inhomogeneous accretion
flows. Only weak excesses can be modelled by reflection, unless the primary
continuum is not directly seen. Finally, a reflection model absorbed by a
modest relativistic wind could be the best solution to the problem.

dominating leptonic radiation process anisotropy and Klein-Nishina effects may
yield spectral and variability signatures in the gamma-ray domain at or above
the sensitivity of current or upcoming gamma-ray telescopes. Analytical
formulae for the steady-state particle spectra are derived assuming diffusive
particle acceleration out of a pool of thermal wind particles, and taking into
account adiabatic and all relevant radiative losses. For the first time we
include their advection/convection in the wind collision zone, and distinguish
two regions within this extended region: the acceleration region where spatial
diffusion is superior to convective/advective motion, and the convection region
defined by the convection time shorter than the diffusion time scale. The
calculation of the Inverse Compton radiation uses the full Klein-Nishina cross
section, and takes into account the anisotropic nature of the scattering
process. This leads to orbital flux variations by up to several orders of
magnitude which may, however, be blurred by the geometry of the system. The
calculations are applied to the typical WR+OB-systems WR 140 and WR 147 to

to an inconsistency between the lepton number transfer and lab frame energy

higher surface gravity T dwarfs have lower effective temperatures and
luminosities for a given spectral type, explaining previously observed scatter
in the Teff/spectral type relation for these objects. Masses, radii and ages
are estimated for the T dwarfs in our sample using the evolutionary models of
Burrows et al.; we also determine masses and radii independently for eight T
dwarfs with measured luminosities. These two determinations are largely

for any structures that could imply a spatial or causal connection between the
nuclear activity and a circumnuclear starburst ring. No evidence is found in
the radio emission for a link between the triggering or feeding of nuclear
activity and the properties of circumnuclear star formation. Conversely, there
is no clear evidence of nuclear outflows or jets triggering activity in the
circumnuclear rings of star formation. Interestingly, the difference in the
angle between the apparent orientation of the most elongated radio emission and
the orientation of the major axis of the galaxy is on average larger in
Seyferts than in starburst galaxies, and Seyferts appear to have a larger
physical size scale of the circumnuclear radio continuum emission. The
concentration, asymmetry, and clumpiness parameters of radio continuum emission
in Seyferts and starbursts are comparable, as are the radial profiles of radio
continuum and near-infrared line emission. The circumnuclear star formation and
supernova rates do not depend on the level of nuclear activity. The radio
emission usually traces the near-infrared Br-gamma and H2 1-0 S(1) line
emission on large spatial scales, but locally their distributions are
different, most likely because of the effects of varying local magnetic fields
and dust absorption and scattering.

similar conditions, for which autocorrelation times are a few ps. Motivated by
these recent results, we study the water dipole reorientation using molecular
dynamics simulations in bulk SPC/E water for temperatures ranging from ambient
300 K down to the deep supercooled region of the phase diagram at 210 K. First,
we calculate the dipole autocorrelation function and find that our simulations
are well-described by a stretched exponential decay, from which we calculate
the {\it orientational autocorrelation time} $\tau_{a}$. Second, we define a
second characteristic time, namely the time required for the randomization of
molecular dipole orientation, the {\it self-dipole randomization time}
$\tau_{r}$, which is an upper limit on $\tau_{a}$; we find that
$\tau_{r}\approx 5 \tau_{a}$. Third, to check if there are correlated domains
of dipoles in water which have large relaxation times compared to the
individual dipoles, we calculate the randomization time $\tau_{\rm box}$ of the
site-dipole field, the net dipole moment formed by a set of molecules belonging
to a box of edge $L_{\rm box}$. We find that the {\it site-dipole randomization
time} $\tau_{\rm box}\approx 2.5 \tau_{a}$ for $L_{\rm box}\approx 3$\AA, i.e.
it is shorter than the same quantity calculated for the self-dipole. Finally,

dynamical field theories for glassforming liquids. In particular, we focus on
the time-reversal symmetry (TRS), which is crucial to obtain
fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDRs). Previous field theoretical treatment
violated this symmetry, whereas others pointed out that constructing symmetry
preserving perturbation theories is a crucial and open issue. In this work we
solve this problem and then apply our results to the mode-coupling theory of
the glass transition (MCT). We show that in the context of dynamical field
theories for glass-forming liquids TRS is expressed as a nonlinear field
transformation that leaves the action invariant. Because of this nonlinearity,
standard perturbation theories generically do not preserve TRS and in
particular FDRs. We show how one can cure this problem and set up
symmetry-preserving perturbation theories by introducing some auxiliary fields.
As an outcome we obtain Schwinger-Dyson dynamical equations that automatically
preserve FDRs and that serve as a basis for carrying out symmetry-preserving
approximations. We apply our results to MCT, revisiting previous field theory
derivations of MCT equations and showing that they generically violate FDR. We
obtain symmetry-preserving mode-coupling equations and discuss their advantages
and drawbacks. Furthermore, we show, contrary to previous works, that the
structure of the dynamic equations is such that the ideal glass transition is
not cut off at any finite order of perturbation theory, even in the presence of
coupling between current and density. The opposite results found in previous
field theoretical works, such as the ones based on nonlinear fluctuating
hydrodynamics, were only due to an incorrect treatment of TRS.

demonstrated that power efficiency improves as one operates with smaller SNR
and vanishing duty factor. Also studied are the capacity improvements that
accrue when the receiver can track phase shifts in the channel or if the
received signal has a specular component. To take advantage of those features,
the phase of the modulation is also allowed to carry information.

was primarily put forth to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion
of the Universe without resorting to dark energy. One of the most intriguing
features of such a model is that it also predicts small effects on the orbital
motion of test particles which could be tested in such a way that local
measurements at Solar System scales would allow to get information on the
global properties of the Universe. Lue and Starkman derived a secular
extra-perihelion \omega precession of 5\times 10^-4 arcseconds per century,
while Iorio showed that the mean longitude \lambda is affected by a secular
precession of about 10^-3 arcseconds per century. Such effects depend only on
the eccentricities e of the orbits via second-order terms: they are, instead,
independent of their semimajor axes a. Up to now, the observational efforts
focused on the dynamics of the inner planets of the Solar System whose orbits
are the best known via radar ranging. Since the competing Newtonian and
Einsteinian effects like the precessions due to the solar quadrupole mass
moment J2, the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic part of the equations of
motion reduce with increasing distances, it would be possible to argue that an
analysis of the orbital dynamics of the outer planets of the Solar System, with
particular emphasis on Saturn because of the ongoing Cassini mission with its
precision ranging instrumentation, could be helpful in evidencing the predicted
new features of motion. In this note we investigate this possibility in view of
the latest results in the planetary ephemeris field. Unfortunately, the current
level of accuracy rules out this appealing possibility and it appears unlikely
that Cassini and GAIA will ameliorate the situation.

different values of the charge to mass ratio. The stars that are in the stable

collapse directly to form black holes. Stars with a charge greater or equal

don't necessarily collapse to form a black hole. A non-linear effect that gives

integration over a large number of events. For DIS and hadron colliders this

posteriori'' inclusion of PDFs, whereby the Monte Carlo run calculates a grid
(in x and Q) of cross section weights that can subsequently be combined with an
arbitrary PDF. The procedure is numerically equivalent to using an interpolated
form of the PDF. The main novelty relative to prior work is the use of
higher-order interpolation, which substantially improves the tradeoff between
accuracy and memory use. An accuracy of about 0.01% has been reached for the
single inclusive cross-section in the central rapidity region |y|<0.5 for jet
transverse momenta from 100 to 5000 GeV. This method should facilitate the
consistent inclusion of final-state data from HERA, Tevatron and LHC in PDF
fits, thus helping to increase the sensitivity of LHC to deviations from

solving Bethe ansatz type equations, and discuss their relation to the quantum
string Bethe ansatz for the su(1|1) sector.

annealed behavior and to a regime where the fluctuations about this behavior
are Gaussian, for the long time asymptotics of the empirical average of the
expected value of the number of random walks which branch and annihilate on
${\mathbb Z}^d$, with stationary random rates. The random walks are
independent, continuous time rate $2d\kappa$, simple, symmetric, with $\kappa

and annihilates at rate $v_-(x)$. The random environment $w$ has coordinates
$w(x)=(v_-(x),v_+(x))$ which are i.i.d. We identify a natural way to describe
the annealed-Gaussian transition mechanism under mild conditions on the rates.
Indeed, we introduce the exponents
$F_\theta(t):=\frac{H_1((1+\theta)t)-(1+\theta)H_1(t)}{\theta}$, and assume
that $\frac{F_{2\theta}(t)-F_\theta(t)}{\theta\log(\kappa t+e)}\to\infty$ for

only one particle at 0. Then the empirical average of $m(x,t,w)$ over a box of
side $L(t)$ has different behaviors: if $ L(t)\ge e^{\frac{1}{d}

numbers is satisfied; if $ L(t)\ge e^{\frac{1}{d} F_\epsilon (2t)}$ for some
$\epsilon>0$ and large enough $t$, a CLT is satisfied. These statements are
violated if the reversed inequalities are satisfied for some negative

  with a Phospholipid Membrane",,,"10.1063/1.2174004",,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Actin filament, F-actin, is a semiflexible polymer with a negative charge,
and is one of the main constituents on cell membranes. To clarify the effect of
cross-talk between a phospholipid membrane and actin filaments in cells, we
conducted microscopic observations on the structural changes in actin filaments
in a cell-sized (several tens of micrometers in diameter) water droplet coated
with a phospholipid membrane such as phosphatidylserine (PS; negatively-charged
head group) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; neutral head group) as a simple
model of a living cell membrane. With PS, actin filaments are distributed
uniformly in the water phase without adsorption onto the membrane surface
between 2 and 6 mM Mg2+, while between 6 and 12 mM Mg2+, actin filaments are
adsorbed onto the inner membrane surface. With PE, actin filaments are
uniformly adsorbed onto the inner membrane surface between 2 and 12 mM Mg2+.
With both PS and PE membranes, at Mg2+ concentrations higher than 12 mM, thick
bundles are formed in the bulk water droplet accompanied by the dissolution of
actin filaments from the membrane surface. The attraction between actin
filaments and membrane is attributable to an increase in the translational
entropy of counterions accompanied by the adsorption of actin filaments onto
the membrane surface. These results suggest that a microscopic water droplet
coated with phospholipid can serve as an easy-to-handle model of cell
membranes.

1D search. Surprisingly, the role of DNA conformation was never considered in
this context. In this article, we explicitly address the relative role of 3D
diffusion and 1D sliding along coiled or globular DNA and the possibility of
correlated re-adsorbtion of desorbed proteins. We have identified a wealth of
new different scaling regimes. We also found the maximal possible acceleration
of the reaction due to sliding, we found that the maximum on the
rate-versus-ionic strength curve is asymmetric, and that sliding can lead not
only to acceleration, but in some regimes to dramatic deceleration of the
reaction.

heat-bath in terms of a path integral, we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational
principle from which we are able to compute the most probable pathway of
folding. The method is applied to the folding of the Villin Headpiece
Subdomain, in the framework of a Go-model. We have found that, in this model,
the transition occurs through an initial collapsing phase driven by the
starting coil configuration and a later rearrangement phase, in which secondary
