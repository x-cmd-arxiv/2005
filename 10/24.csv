against collapse by rapid differential rotation -- are possible transient
remnants of binary neutron star mergers. Using newly developed codes for
magnetohydrodynamic simulations in dynamical spacetimes, we are able to track
the evolution of a magnetized HMNS in full general relativity for the first
time. We find that secular angular momentum transport due to magnetic braking
and the magnetorotational instability results in the collapse of an HMNS to a
rotating black hole, accompanied by a gravitational wave burst. The nascent
black hole is surrounded by a hot, massive torus undergoing quasistationary
accretion and a collimated magnetic field. This scenario suggests that HMNS
collapse is a possible candidate for the central engine of short gamma-ray
bursts.

However, both the prompt hard X-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the BAT)
and the first ~ 300 s of X-ray emission (observed by the XRT) can be explained
by exponential decays, with similar decay constants. Extrapolating the BAT
light curve into the XRT band suggests the rapidly decaying, early X-ray
emission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strong
similarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early X-ray emission may be related
to the simple temporal and spectral character of this X-ray rich GRB. The
prompt (BAT) spectrum was a steep down to 15 keV, and appeared to continue
through the XRT bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with the
Amati relation. Following the initial steep decline the X-ray afterglow did not
fade for ~1.2*10^4 s, after which time it decayed with a temporal index of
alpha ~ 0.7, followed by a second break at ~2.5*10^5 s to a slope of alpha ~ 2.
The apparent `plateau' in the X-ray light curve, after the early rapid decay,
makes this one of the most extreme examples of the steep-flat-steep X-ray light
curves revealed by Swift. If the second afterglow break is identified with a
jet break then the jet opening angle was theta_0 ~ 5 deg, and implying E_gamma

the well known 'knee' in the cosmic ray energy spectrum at 3 PeV: the mass of
the predominant particles at this energy and their source. It is inevitable in
a subject such as this that ideas - and conclusions - evolve. Earlier, we had
used a particular acceleration model and the nature of the local ISM to infer
that the particles are mainly oxygen nuclei. Initially no specific source was
identified. More recently, however, we have specified the Monogem Ring
supernova remnant (SNR) as the likely source; this is at just the right
distance and age and the energies are reasonable. Concerning the mass
composition at the knee, a quantity more difficult to determine, recent direct
measurements, which extend to higher energies than hitherto, show a likely
flattening in the spectrum above 10^4 GeV/nucleon for He-nuclei, a flattening
which, if extrapolated to higher energies, would meet the measured spectrum in
the knee region. The other nuclei do not show this feature. He-nuclei in the
knee region would also be marginally consistent with KASCADE EAS data, although
there are serious problems with EAS mass estimates in that experiment.
Concerning the acceleration, recent models applied to the Monogem Ring SNR
allow a satisfactory explanation in terms of either oxygen or helium, but with
the latter being a distinct possibility and perhaps more likely.

nonlinear Schroedinger equation with coefficients that are obtained explicitly
for a particular model of a disc. The properties of this equation are analysed

nonlinear and dispersive effects both depend on the compressibility of the gas
through its adiabatic index Gamma. In the physically realistic case Gamma<3,
nonlinearity does not lead to the steepening of bending waves but instead
enhances their linear dispersion. In the opposite case Gamma>3, nonlinearity
leads to wave steepening and solitary waves are supported. The effects of a
small effective viscosity, which may suppress parametric instabilities, are
also considered. This analysis may provide a useful point of comparison between
theory and numerical simulations of warped accretion discs.

therefore the free expansion phase of the remnant will be short (~ 1 - 10 yr).
In general the remnants will be observable for a considerable time (~ 10^6 -
10^7 yr). Events releasing large amounts of kinetic energy may be responsible
for a subsample of observed giant HI holes of unknown origin as compact
binaries merge far away from star forming regions. If the ejecta consist
primarily of actinides, on long timescales the expelled material will contain
mainly the few quasi-stable nuclei in the actinides range. Consequently the
abundance of each isotope in the ejecta might be of the order of a few percent.
During their decay some actinides will produce observational signatures in form
of gamma ray lines. We particularly investigate the gamma ray emission of Am
243, Cm 247, Cm 248 and Bi 208 and estimate their observability in nearby
remnants. Detections of the gamma ray lines with INTEGRAL will be possible only
in very advantageous cases but these remnants are promising targets for future
instruments using focusing optics for soft gamma rays. Due to the low mass
expelled in mergers and due to the lack of free electrons in the ejecta, the
merger remnants might be significantly fainter in bremsstrahlung and
synchrotron radiation than comparable supernova remnants. Hence merger remnants
might represent a candidate for very recently discovered 'dark accelerators'

inner turbulent region and most importantly by the excitation and sonic damping
of core g-mode oscillations. An l=1 mode with a period of ~3 ms grows to be
prominent around ~500 ms after bounce. The accreting protoneutron star is a
self-excited oscillator. The associated acoustic power seen in our
11-solar-mass simulation is sufficient to drive the explosion. The angular
distribution of the emitted sound is fundamentally aspherical. The sound pulses
radiated from the core steepen into shock waves that merge as they propagate
into the outer mantle and deposit their energy and momentum with high
efficiency. The core oscillation acts like a transducer to convert accretion
energy into sound. An advantage of the acoustic mechanism is that acoustic
power does not abate until accretion subsides, so that it is available as long
as it may be needed to explode the star. [abridged]

Starting from the Hubbard model and focusing on the insulator side, we derive
an effective spin Hamiltonian up to four-spin exchanges in the presence of
magnetic field, and find that the magnetic field couples linearly to spin
chirality on the triangles. The latter corresponds to a flux of an internal
gauge field in a gauge theory description of the spin liquid, and therefore a
static such internal flux is induced. A quantitative estimate of the effect is
obtained using a spinon mean field analysis, where we find that this orbital
field seen by the spinons is comparable to or even larger than the applied
field. We further argue that because the stiffness of the emergent internal
gauge field is very small, such a spinon-gauge system is strongly susceptible
at low temperatures to an instability of the homogeneous state due to strong
Landau level quantization for spinons. This instability is reminiscent of the
so-called strong magnetic interaction regime in metals with the usual
electromagnetic field, but we estimate that the corresponding

  Qualitative changes in phonon PDF signals a polaronic crossover while an
electronic Metal Insulator Transition (MIT) due to pairing into a bipolaronic
state can be seen from a gap in the electronic DOS or by the vanishing of the
quasi particle spectral weight. MIT can be observed only at sufficiently high
density provided the Coulomb repulsion is neglected. In the limit of low
density the carrier show a polaronic behavior trough the development of a
definite polarization shifting the average value of the phonon PDF. At large
densities occupied and empty sites result an a bimodal the phonon PDF.
  At the polaron crossover fluctuation of phonon coordinates tends to be larger
than those at any other coupling. In this regime Born-Oppenheimer approximation
is shown to fail also when phonon frequency is much less then electron
bandwidth. For a single hole in the t-J model a further source of localization
is due to magnetic superexchange energy which tends to localize the spin-defect
spreading due to the presence of the hole.

of computation. For example, the recursive functions are strictly more powerful
than the primitive recursive functions, because the latter are a proper subset
of the former (which includes Ackermann's function). Side-by-side with this
""containment"" method of measuring power, it is standard to use an approach
based on ""simulation"". For example, one says that the (untyped) lambda calculus
is as powerful--computationally speaking--as the partial recursive functions,
because the lambda calculus can simulate all partial recursive functions by
encoding the natural numbers as Church numerals.
  The problem is that unbridled use of these two ways of comparing power allows
one to show that some computational models are strictly stronger than
themselves! We argue that a better definition is that model A is strictly
stronger than B if A can simulate B via some encoding, whereas B cannot
simulate A under any encoding. We then show that the recursive functions are
strictly stronger in this sense than the primitive recursive. We also prove
that the recursive functions, partial recursive functions, and Turing machines
are ""complete"", in the sense that no injective encoding can make them
equivalent to any ""hypercomputational"" model.

send out coded packets formed from random linear combinations of previously
received packets. All coding and decoding operations have polynomial
complexity.
  We show that the scheme is capacity-achieving as long as packets received on
a link arrive according to a process that has an average rate. Thus, packet
losses on a link may exhibit correlation in time or with losses on other links.
In the special case of Poisson traffic with i.i.d. losses, we give error
exponents that quantify the rate of decay of the probability of error with
coding delay. Our analysis of the scheme shows that it is not only
capacity-achieving, but that the propagation of packets carrying ""innovative""

therefore fluid flow models yield good approximations. We consider networks
with both lossy point-to-point and broadcast links, allowing us to model both

antenna arrays that provide dramatic gains in slow fading wireless
environments. However most of the proposed solutions require distributed
space-time coding algorithms, the careful design of which is left for future
investigation if there is more than one cooperative relay. We propose a novel
scheme, that alleviates these problems and provides diversity gains on the
order of the number of relays in the network. Our scheme first selects the best
relay from a set of M available relays and then uses this best relay for
cooperation between the source and the destination. We develop and analyze a
distributed method to select the best relay that requires no topology
information and is based on local measurements of the instantaneous channel
conditions. This method also requires no explicit communication among the
relays. The success (or failure) to select the best available path depends on
the statistics of the wireless channel, and a methodology to evaluate
performance for any kind of wireless channel statistics, is provided.
Information theoretic analysis of outage probability shows that our scheme
achieves the same diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as achieved by more complex
protocols, where coordination and distributed space-time coding for M nodes is
required, such as those proposed in [7]. The simplicity of the technique,
allows for immediate implementation in existing radio hardware and its adoption

of multiple transmit antennas, named coordinate interleaving (CI), is presented
as a generalization of component interleaving for a single transmit antenna.
The extent of any advantages of CI over BICM, relative to CM, is analyzed from
a mutual information perspective; the analysis is based on an equivalent
parallel channel model for CI. Several expressions for mutual information in
the presence of CI and multiple transmit and receive antennas are derived.
Results show that CI gives higher mutual information compared to that of BICM

energy density and pressure of the cosmic fluid as well as the Hubble parameter
remain finite while all derivatives of the Hubble parameter diverge (i.e.,
${\dot H}$, ${\ddot H}$, etc. $\to \infty$). Since the Kretschmann invariant
diverges ($R_{iklm}R^{iklm} \to \infty$) at the singularity, one expects
quantum effects to play an important role as the quiescent singularity is
approached. We explore the effects of vacuum polarization due to massless
conformally coupled fields near the singularity and show that these can either
cause the universe to recollapse or, else, lead to a softer singularity at
which $H$, ${\dot H}$, and ${\ddot H}$ remain finite while ${\dddot H}$ and
higher derivatives of the Hubble parameter diverge. An important aspect of the
quiescent singularity is that it is encountered in regions of low density,
which has obvious implications for a universe consisting of a cosmic web of
high and low density regions -- superclusters and voids. In addition to vacuum
polarization, the effects of quantum particle production of non-conformal
fields are also likely to be important. A preliminary examination shows that
intense particle production can lead to an accelerating universe whose Hubble
parameter shows oscillations about a constant value.

leading-twist partonic scattering plus fragmentation is the most important
mechanism at collider energies. High-p_T baryons on the other hand appear to be
produced by higher-twist mechanisms at all available energies. The higher-twist
mechanism of direct proton production can be verified experimentally by testing
whether high p_T protons are produced as single hadrons without accompanying

incompressible Euler equation is performed in the short-time asymptotic
r\'egime when such singularities are very far from the real domain; this allows
an exact recursive determination of arbitrarily many spatial Fourier
coefficients. Using high-precision arithmetic we find that the Fourier
coefficients of the stream function are given over more than two decades of
wavenumbers by $\hat F(\k) = C(\theta) k^{-\alpha} \ue ^ {-k \delta(\theta)}$,
where $\k = k(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. The prefactor exponent $\alpha$,
typically between 5/2 and 8/3, is determined with an accuracy better than 0.01.
It depends on the initial condition but not on $\theta$. The vorticity diverges
as $s^{-\beta}$, where $\alpha+\beta= 7/2$ and $s$ is the distance to the
(complex) singular manifold. This new type of non-universal singularity is
permitted by the strong reduction of nonlinearity (depletion) which is
associated to incompressibility. Spectral calculations show that the scaling
reported above persists well beyond the time of validity of the short-time
asymptotics. A simple model in which the vorticity is treated as a passive
scalar is shown analytically to have universal singularities with exponent
$\alpha =5/2$.

should be helpful for finding different entanglement types in multipartite pure
state systems.

classical. One can trade accuracy for speed and find a part of the database (a
block) containing the target item even faster: this is partial search. One can
think of partial search in following terms: an exact address of the target item
is given by a sequence of many bites, but we want to find only several first
bites of the address. We consider different partial search algorithms
consisting of a sequence of global and local searches and suggest the optimal
one. Global search consists of the standard Grover iterations for the whole
database. Local search consists of Grover iterations in each individual block
made simultaneously in all blocks. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by
number of queries to the oracle.

"quant-ph/0510180","Virendra Singh","Virendra Singh","Einstein and the Quantum","22 pages. Current Science (to appear)",,,"TIFR/TH/05-39","quant-ph",,"  We review here the main contributions of Einstein to the quantum theory. To
put them in perspective we first give an account of Physics as it was before
him. It is followed by a brief account of the problem of black body radiation
which provided the context for Planck to introduce the idea of quantum.
Einstein's revolutionary paper of 1905 on light-quantum hypothesis is then
described as well as an application of this idea to the photoelectric effect.
We next take up a discussion of Einstein's other contributions to old quantum
theory. These include (i) his theory of specific heat of solids, which was the
first application of quantum theory to matter, (ii) his discovery of
wave-particle duality for light and (iii) Einstein's A and B coefficients
relating to the probabilities of emission and absorption of light by atomic
systems and his discovery of radiation stimulated emission of light which
provides the basis for laser action. We then describe Einstein's contribution
to quantum statistics viz Bose-Einstein Statistics and his prediction of
Bose-Einstein condensation of a boson gas. Einstein played a pivotal role in
the discovery of Quantum mechanics and this is briefly mentioned. After 1925
Einstein's contributed mainly to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. We
choose to discuss here (i) his Ensemble (or Statistical) Interpretation of
Quantum Mechanics and (ii) the discovery of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
correlations and the EPR theorem on the conflict between Einstein-Locality and
the completeness of the formalism of Quantum Mechanics. We end with some
comments on later developments.

wish to delete one copy from among the given two copies. The quantum
no-deletion principle restricts us from perfectly deleting a copy but it does
not prohibit us from deleting a copy approximately. Here we construct two types
of a universal quantum deletion machine which approximately deletes a copy such
that the fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state. The two types
of universal quantum deletion machines are (1) a conventional deletion machine
described by one unitary operator and (2) a modified deletion machine described
by two unitary operators. Here it is shown that modified deletion machine
deletes a qubit with fidelity 0.75, which is the maximum limit for deleting an
unknown quantum state. In addition to this we also show that the modified
deletion machine retains the qubit in the first mode with average fidelity 0.77
(approx.) which is slightly greater than the fidelity of measurement for two
given identical state, showing how precisely one can determine its state [13].
We also show that the deletion machine itself is input state independent i.e.
the information is not hidden in the deleting machine, and hence we can delete
the information completely from the deletion machine.

Rev. A 73, 062307 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062307",,"quant-ph",,"  Most investigations devoted to the conditions for adiabatic quantum computing
are based on the first-order correction ${\bra{\Psi_{\rm ground}(t)}\dot
H(t)\ket{\Psi_{\rm excited}(t)} /\Delta E^2(t)\ll1}$. However, it is
demonstrated that this first-order correction does not yield a good estimate
for the computational error. Therefore, a more general criterion is proposed,
which includes higher-order corrections as well and shows that the
computational error can be made exponentially small -- which facilitates
significantly shorter evolution times than the above first-order estimate in
certain situations. Based on this criterion and rather general arguments and
assumptions, it can be demonstrated that a run-time $T$ of order of the inverse
minimum energy gap $\Delta E_{\rm min}$ is sufficient and necessary, i.e.,
$T=\ord(\Delta E_{\rm min}^{-1})$. For some examples, these analytical
investigations are confirmed by numerical simulations. PACS: 03.67.Lx,
