galaxies, NGC1569, IIZw40, NGC1140 and the 30Dor region of the LMC and explore
the properties of the ISM in low-metallicity environments, also using
additional sources from the literature. We analyse the various components of
the ISM probed by the mid-infrared observations and compare them with other
Galactic and extragalactic objects. The MIR spectra of the low-metallicity
starburst sources are dominated by the [NeIII] and [SIV] lines, as well as a
steeply rising dust continuum. PAH bands are generaly faint, both locally and
averaged over the full galaxy, in stark contrast to dustier starburst galaxies,
where the PAH features are very prominant and even dominate on global scales.
The hardness of the modeled interstellar radiation fields for the dwarf
galaxies increases as the presence of PAH band emission becomes less
pronounced. The [NeIII]/[NeII] ratios averaged over the full galaxy are
strikingly high, often >10. Thus, the hard radiation fields are pronounced and
pervasive. We find a prominent correlation between the PAHs/VSGs and the
[NeIII]/[NeII] ratios for a wide range of objects, including the low
metallicity galaxies as well as Galactic HII regions and other metal-rich
galaxies. This effect is consistent with the hardness of the interstellar
radiation field playing a major role in the destruction of PAHs in the low
metallicity ISM. We see a PAHs/VSGs and metallicity correlation, also found by
Engelbracht et al. (2005) for a larger survey. Combined effects of metallicity
and radiation field seem to be playing important roles in the observed behavior
of PAHs in the low metallicity systems.

molecular species as the gas flows towards the ionization front. We identify
models for which the OH column densities are comparable to those measured in
observations undertaken to study the magnetic fields in star forming regions

abundant if the observed OH arises through a combination of the liberation of
H2O from surfaces and photodissociation. They include CH3OH, H2CO, and H2S.
Observations of these other species may help establish the nature of the OH

particle within the Standard Model: the $H$ dibaryon. We consider as well a
scenario which aims to connect the dark matter origin to the Baryon Asymmetry
of the Universe, studying the examples of $H$ and of a BSM particle $X$.
Strongly attractive color forces in the flavor singlet channel may lead to a
tightly bound and compact $H$ dibaryon. We find that the observation of
$\Lambda$ decays from doubly-strange hypernuclei puts a constraint on the $H$
wavefunction which is plausibly satisfied. In this case the $H$ is long-lived
as we calculate. We also show that an $H$ or another compact, flavor singlet
hadron is unlikely to bind to nuclei, so that experimental bounds on exotic
isotopes do not exclude their existence. Remarkably, the $H$ appears to evade
other experimental constraints as well, when account is taken of its expected
compact spatial wavefunction. We check whether the $H$ is a viable DM candidate
by considering DM experiments sensitive to light particles. Taking into account
the DM interaction in the crust above underground detectors we find a window in
the exclusion limits in the micro-barn, $m\lsi 2.4$ GeV, range which coincides
with the range expected for the tightly bound $H$. Finally, we present a
scenario in which DM carries (anti-)baryon number and which offers a mechanism
to generate the baryon asymmetry observed in the Universe. If $\sigma^{annih}
_{\bar{X}} < \sigma^{annih}_{X}$, the $\bar{X}$'s freeze out at a higher
temperature and have a larger relic density than $X$'s. If $m_X \lsi 4.5 B_X$

from two large spectroscopic libraries of T dwarfs identified largely in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two Micron All Sky Survey, nine primary
spectral standards and five alternate standards spanning spectral types T0 to
T8 are identified that match criteria of spectral character, brightness,
absence of a resolved companion and accessibility from both northern and
southern hemispheres. The classification of T dwarfs is formally made by the
direct comparison of near infrared spectral data of equivalent resolution to
the spectra of these standards. Alternately, we have redefined five key
spectral indices measuring the strengths of the major H$_2$O and CH$_4$ bands
in the 1-2.5 micron region that may be used as a proxy to direct spectral
comparison. Two methods of determining T spectral type using these indices are
outlined and yield equivalent results. These classifications are also
equivalent to those from prior schemes, implying that no revision of existing
spectral type trends is required. The one-dimensional scheme presented here
provides a first step toward the observational characterization of the lowest

transverse velocity dispersions, to compare with the chromospheric results. The
kinematic method is a less reliable age estimator because EH stars lie red-ward

objects in the Universe are powered by the flow of matter through accretion
disks onto black holes. Accretion disk systems are observed to emit copious
radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, each energy band providing
access to rather distinct regimes of physical conditions and geometric scale.
X-ray emission probes the innermost regions of the accretion disk, where
relativistic effects prevail. While this has been known for decades, it also
has been acknowledged that inferring physical conditions in the relativistic
regime from the behavior of the X-ray continuum is problematic and not
satisfactorily constraining. With the discovery in the 1990s of iron X-ray
lines bearing signatures of relativistic distortion came the hope that such
emission would more firmly constrain models of disk accretion near black holes,
as well as provide observational criteria by which to test general relativity
in the strong field limit. Here we provide an introduction to this phenomenon.
While the presentation is intended to be primarily tutorial in nature, we aim
also to acquaint the reader with trends in current research. To achieve these
ends, we present the basic applications of general relativity that pertain to
X-ray spectroscopic observations of black hole accretion disk systems, focusing
on the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions to the Einstein field equations. To
this we add treatments of the fundamental concepts associated with the
theoretical and modeling aspects of accretion disks, as well as relevant topics
from observational and theoretical X-ray spectroscopy.

function of frequency over a range covering from 500 Hz to 1000 Hz. As
previously found for 4U 1636-536, we show that the quality factor of the lower
kilo-Hz increases with frequency up to a maximum frequency around 800 Hz,
beyond which an abrupt drop of its coherence is observed down to a limiting
frequency where the QPO disappears completely. Simultaneously the amplitude of
the QPOs is almost constant below the peak frequency and starts to decrease
smoothly afterwards. The peak frequency is 850 Hz, 820 Hz, 740 Hz whereas the
limiting frequency is 920 Hz, 900 Hz and 830 Hz for 4U 1636-536, 4U 1608-522

which could be related to the last stable circular orbit.

secure sample of lenses with photometric redshifts 0.2<z<0.4 and study the
relation between the virial mass and baryonic contents. In addition, we discuss
the implications of the derived photometric redshift distribution for published
cosmic shear studies. The virial masses are derived from a fit to the observed
lensing signal. For a galaxy with a fiducial luminosity of 10^10 h^-2 L_Bsun we
obtain a mass M_vir=9.9^{+1.5}_{-1.3}\times 10^11 h^-1 M_sun. The virial mass
as a function of luminosity is consistent with a power-law ~L^1.5, with similar
slopes for the three filters considered here. These findings are in excellent
agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and semi-analytic

predicted stellar mass-to-light ratios. We find that star formation is
inefficient in converting baryons into stars, with late-type galaxies
converting ~33% and early-type galaxies converting only ~14% of baryons into

longer-lived (10-14 Gyr) main sequence star, in which case the object is
predicted to be a low-mass white dwarf with M ~ 0.45 M_sun.

host-galaxy properties from eleven existing data sets. To guide theoretical
understanding, we first try to quantify the tightness of the intrinsic
correlations. Given the estimated measurement errors, we evaluate the
probability distribution of the residual variance in excess of that expected
from the measurement errors. Our central result is that the current data sets
do not allow definite conclusions regarding the quality of the true
correlations because the obtained probability distributions for the residual
variance overlap for most quantities. We then consider which of the relations
offer the best inferences of BH mass when there is no direct measurement
available. As with the residual variances, we find that the probability
distribution of expected uncertainty in inferred BH masses overlaps
significantly for most of the relations. Photometric methods would then be
preferred because the data are easier to obtain, as long as bulge-disk
decomposition or detailed modeling of the photometric profile (as in
\citet{graham:01}) do not present problems. Determining which correlation
offers the best inferences requires reducing the uncertainty in the expected
error in the inferred BH masses (the ``error on the error''). This uncertainty
is currently limited by uncertainty in the residual variance for all of the
relations.

lower than has been quoted in the recent literature c) the yield for extremely
metal poor stars by the HES Survey is somewhat lower than is stated in the

among the giants in the HES sample with -4 < [Fe/H] < -2.0 dex is 7.4 +-2.9%;
adding an estimate for the C-enhanced giants with [C/Fe] > 1.0 dex without

factor of ~10 higher than those obtained via the algorithm used by the HES

identical to that used until very recently by the HK Survey. This error in

many of the problems inherent to previous galaxy and cluster catalogs which
limited their effectiveness in determining the origin of the Local Group's

determine that 44% of the Local Group's peculiar velocity is due to infall into
the GA region, while 56% is in the form of a large-scale flow induced by more
distant overdensities between 130 and 180 h^-1 Mpc away. In agreement with
previous analyses, we find that the Shapley supercluster is the single
overdensity most responsible for the increase in the dipole amplitude beyond
130 h^-1 Mpc, generating 30.4% of the large-scale contribution. We find that
numerous groupings and loose associations of clusters at roughly the same
distance as the Shapley region induce a significant acceleration on the Local
Group. These include the well known Horologium-Reticulum concentration, as well
as newly noted associations centered on Abell 3667 and Abell 3391 and a string
of CIZA clusters near C1410 which may trace an extension of the Shapley complex
into the Zone of Avoidance. We also note that the large-scale anisotropy
measured in the cluster distribution near 150 h^-1 Mpc may be due to an
observed underdensity of clusters in the northern hemisphere near this
distance. (abridged)

followed the discovery in 1997 of their broadband (X-ray, optical, and radio)
afterglow emission. Here we present the discovery of the X-ray afterglow of a
short-hard burst whose accurate position allows us to unambiguously associate
it with a star-forming galaxy at redshift z=0.160, and whose optical lightcurve
definitively excludes a supernova association. Together with results from three
other recent short-hard bursts, this suggests that short-hard bursts release
much less energy than the long-duration GRBs. Models requiring young stellar
populations, such as magnetars and collapsars, are ruled out, while coalescing
degenerate binaries remain the most promising progenitor candidates.

possible scenarios of chemical enrichment and development of galactic winds. In
order not to overestimate the current metallicity of the interstellar gas
inferred from H II region spectroscopy, we suggest that the winds efficiently
remove from the galaxies the metal-rich ejecta of dying stars. Conversely,
requiring the final mass of neutral gas to match the value inferred from 21-cm
observations implies a relatively low efficiency of interstellar medium
entrainment in the outflow, thus confirming previous findings that the winds
driving the evolution of typical starbursts are differential. These conclusions
could be different only if the galaxies accrete huge fractions of unprocessed
gas at late times. By assuming standard stellar yields we obtain a good fit to
the observed nitrogen to oxygen ratio of NGC 1569, while the mean N/O ratio in
NGC 1705 is overestimated by the models. Reducing the extent of hot bottom
burning in low-metallicity intermediate-mass stars does not suffice to solve
the problem. Localized self-pollution from stars more massive than 60 MSun in
NGC 1705 and/or funneling of larger fractions of nitrogen through its winds are
then left to explain the discrepancy between model predictions and
observations. Inspection of the log(N/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 diagram for a sample

analyze the effect of such a component on the observable spectrum, assuming
that the observable effects are due to a dissipation process occurring below or
near the thermal photosphere. We consider both the internal shock model and a
'slow heating' model as possible dissipation mechanisms. For comparable energy
densities in the thermal and the leptonic component, the dominant emission
mechanism is Compton scattering. This leads to a nearly flat energy spectrum
(\nu F_\nu \propto \nu^0) above the thermal peak at ~10-100 keV and below
10-100 MeV, for a wide range of optical depths 0.03 <~ \tau_{\gamma e} <~ 100,
regardless of the details of the dissipation mechanism or the strength of the
magnetic field. At lower energies steep slopes are expected, while above 100
MeV the spectrum depends on the details of the dissipation process. For higher
values of the optical depth, a Wien peak is formed at 100 keV - 1 MeV, and no
higher energy component exists. For any value of \tau_{\gamma e}, the number of
pairs produced does not exceed the baryon related electrons by a factor larger
than a few. We conclude that dissipation near the thermal photosphere can
naturally explain both the steep slopes observed at low energies and a flat
spectrum above 10 keV, thus providing an alternative scenario to the optically
thin synchrotron - SSC model.

Lorentz factors of electrons and positrons is relatively high, one of the
circularly polarized waves becomes super-luminal and therefore can not be
generated by cyclotron instability. We suggest that this case corresponds to
the pulsars with the domination of one hand of circular polarization through
the whole averaged pulse profile at all observed frequencies. For intermediate
values of the difference between Lorentz factors both circularly polarized
waves are generated, but the waves of one handness are much more effectively
generated for high frequencies, whereas generation of another handness
dominates for low frequencies. This should correspond to the pulsars with
strong frequency dependence of the degree of circular polarization. The case of

possible bias, we investigate the possibility of using observations of

gravitational clustering and from non-linear bias. We find that the expected
signal is ~ 0.1 mJy at 325 MHz (z=3.4) for the small baselines at the GMRT, the
strength being a few times larger at higher frequencies 610 MHz (z=1.3).
Further, the magnitude of the signal from the bispectrum is predicted to be
comparable to that from the power spectrum, allowing a detection of both in
roughly the same integration time. The HI signal is found to be uncorrelated
beyond frequency separations of 1.3 MHz whereas the continuum sources of
continuum are expected to be correlated across much larger frequencies.
  This signature can in principle be used to distinguish the HI signal from the
contamination. We also consider the possibility of using observations of the

planets. This survey aims to detect close-in giant planets, which are most
likely to transit their host star. For this programme, high-precision radial
velocities are measured with the ELODIE fiber-fed spectrograph on the 1.93-m
telescope, and high-precision photometry is obtained with the CCD Camera on the
1.20-m telescope, both at the Haute-Provence Observatory. We report here the
discovery of a new transiting hot Jupiter orbiting the star HD189733. The
planetary nature of this object is confirmed by the observation of both the
spectroscopic and photometric transits. The exoplanet HD189733b, with an
orbital period of 2.219 days, has one of the shortest orbital periods detected
by radial velocities, and presents the largest photometric depth in the light
curve (~ 3%) observed to date. We estimate for the planet a mass of 1.15 +-
0.04 Mjup and a radius of 1.26 +- 0.03 RJup. Considering that HD189733 has the
same visual magnitude as the well known exoplanet host star HD209458, further
ground-based and space-based follow-up observations are very promising and will
permit a characterization of the atmosphere and exosphere of this giant
exoplanet.

that it was then radiating much more efficiently than today); and, perhaps, an
early accretion phase of supermassive black holes in galaxies. Assuming that

invoked. The depletion of Li6 should be different, both in magnitude and in its

those in the z~0 population. Comparison of low-z DLA statistics with the HI

our data indicates evolution of a factor of two in the comoving density along a
line of sight. We find that dN/dz(z=0)=0.045 +/- 0.006. The idea that the local
galaxy population can explain the DLAs is further strengthened by comparing the
properties of DLAs and DLA galaxies with the expectations based on our analysis
of local galaxies. The distribution of luminosities of DLA host galaxies, and
of impact parameters between QSOs and the centres of DLA galaxies, are in good
agreement with what is expected from local galaxies. Approximately 87% of low z
DLA galaxies are expected to be fainter than L* and 37 per cent have impact
parameters less than 1'' at z=0.5. The analysis shows that some host galaxies
with very low impact parameters and low luminosities are expected to be missed

this paper we consider the effect of moderate rotation on both evolutionary

completely neglected as it has been done until now. In particular it is found
that even for low-to-moderate rotational velocities (15-50 km/s), differences
in period ratios of some hundredths can be found. The main consequence is
therefore the confusion scenario generated when trying to fit the metallicity

probed in these clusters are M_{V} - 5logh_{0.7} = -13.3, -15.4 and -16.7mag

for these three clusters, the core radius is invariant with intrinsic

brightest galaxies in A2218 which exhibit a more compact spatial distribution.

identify two H(T) lines defining the onset and the end of the effect. At H1(T)
a sudden increase in the curvature of the pinning potential wells with field

dynamics in Josephson Junction arrays (JJA) driven by a dc current. Dynamical
phase diagrams for different magnetic fields, current directions and varying
temperature are discussed and compared.
  First, the effect of thermal fluctuations in a current driven diluted vortex
lattice (VL) with f=1/25 is analyzed. The more interesting studied regime is
the one for large currents where there is sequence of transitions for the
transverse response of a fast moving VL. A transverse depinning temperature
below the melting transition of the moving VL is obtained.
  We also discuss the dependence with the direction of the applied dc current
of the transport properties of diluted VL at low temperatures. We show that
orientational pinning phenomenon leads to a finite transverse critical current
when the bias current is applied in the directions of high symmetry and it
leads to an anomalous transverse voltage when vortices are driven away from the
favorable directions. In addition, the effect of disorder with a diagonal dc
current applied is analyzed and a finite transverse voltage is also observed in
this case.
  The fully frustrated JJA (f=1/2) case is also discussed. In equilibrium, the
low temperature phase has two broken symmetries: the U(1) symmetry and the Z_2
symmetry. At high currents two well separated transitions are observed. The
order of the checkerboard VL (discrete Z_2 symmetry) is destroyed at a much
lower temperature than the transverse superconducting coherence (continuous
U(1) symmetry).

consistent with a weak-coupling regime except in the under-doped region where
we observe an in-gap collective mode at 4.5 k_{B}T_c while the maximum
amplitude of the SC gap is ~8 k_{B}T_{c}. In the normal state, doped carriers
divide into coherent quasi-particles (QPs) and carriers that remain incoherent.
The coherent QPs mainly reside in the vicinity of (\pi/2, \pi/2) regions of the
Brillouin zone (BZ). We find that only coherent QPs contribute to the
superfluid density in the B_{2g} channel. The persistence of SC coherence peaks
in the B_{2g} channel for all dopings implies that superconductivity is mainly
governed by interactions between the hole-like coherent QPs in the vicinity of
(\pi/2, \pi/2) regions of the BZ. We establish that superconductivity in the
electron-doped cuprates occurs primarily due to pairing and condensation of
hole-like carriers. We have also studied the excitations across the SC gap by
Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature (T) and magnetic field (H) for
several different cerium dopings (x). Effective upper critical field lines
H*_{c2}(T, x) at which the superfluid stiffness vanishes and
H^{2\Delta}_{c2}(T, x) at which the SC gap amplitude is suppressed by field
have been determined; H^{2\Delta}_{c2}(T, x) is larger than H*_{c2}(T, x) for
all doping concentrations. The difference between the two quantities suggests
the presence of phase fluctuations that increase for x< 0.15. It is found that
the magnetic field suppresses the magnitude of the SC gap linearly at
surprisingly small fields.

function method to calculate the electronic structure of nanocontacts while the
ballistic transmission and conductance eigenchannels were obtained by means of
the Kubo approach as formulated by Baranger and Stone. We demonstrate that the
conductance of the systems is mainly determined by the electronic properties of
the atom bridging the macroscopic leads. We classify the conducting
eigenchannels according to the atomic orbitals of the contact atom and the
irreducible representations of the symmetry point group of the system that
leads to the microscopic understanding of the conductance. We show that if
impurity resonances in the density of states of the contact atom appear at the
Fermi energy, additional channels of appropriate symmetry could open. On the
other hand the transmission of the existing channels could be blocked by
impurity scattering.

the ""Lorentz-Poincar\'e""-interpretation of SRT can be continued into GRT. We
have shown that till first Post-Newtonian order this is indeed possible

$c(r)$, a scalar scaling field $\Phi$ and induced velocity field $w$. Still the

partially quenched or mixed action QCD is identical to that of QCD. Thus one
can extract infinite volume scattering parameters from mixed action
simulations. We then determine the scattering length for both 2 and 2+1 sea
quarks in the isospin limit. The scattering length, when expressed in terms of
the pion mass and the decay constant measured on the lattice, has no
contributions from mixed valence-sea mesons, thus it does not depend upon the
parameter, C_Mix, that appears in the chiral Lagrangian of the mixed theory. In
addition, the contributions which nominally arise from operators appearing in
the mixed action O(a^2 m_q) Lagrangian exactly cancel when the scattering
length is written in this form. This is in contrast to the scattering length
expressed in terms of the bare parameters of the chiral Lagrangian, which

we revisit the prospects for detecting neutrinos produced by the annihilation
of WIMPs in the Sun. We find that the latest bounds do not seriously limit the
models most accessible to next generation kilometer-scale neutrino telescopes
such as IceCube. This is largely due to the fact that models with significant
spin-dependent couplings to protons are the least constrained and, at the same
time, the most promising because of the efficient capture of WIMPs in the Sun.
We identify models where dark matter particles are beyond the reach of any
planned direct detection experiments while within reach of neutrino telescopes.
In summary, we find that, even when contemplating recent direct detection
results, neutrino telescopes still have the opportunity to play an important as
well as complementary role in the search for particle dark matter.

lightlike direction can admit semigroup extensions of their isometry groups. We
show by concrete examples that such a semigroup can exhibit a natural order,
which in turn implies the existence of preferred coordinate charts on the
underlying space. Specifically, for spacetimes which are products of an
external Minkowski space with an internal two-dimensional Lorentzian space,
where one of the lightlike directions has a compact size, the preferred charts
consist of ""infinite-momentum"" frames on the internal space. This implies that
fields viewed from this preferred frame acquire extreme values; in particular,
some of the off-diagonal components of the higher-dimensional metric, which may
be regarded as gauge potentials for a field theory on the external Minkowski
factor, vanish. This raises the possibility of regarding known gauge theories
as part of more extended field multiplets which have been reduced in size since
they are perceived from within an extreme frame. In the case of an external
4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime times a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder,
the field content as seen in the preferred frame is that of a five-dimensional
Kaluza-Klein theory, where the electrodynamic potentials Am may depend, in
addition to the external spacetime coordinates, on a fifth coordinate along a
lightlike direction. The fact that the metric along this direction is zero
obstructs the generation of field equations from the Ricci tensor of the
overall metric.

other authors, which implies an upper bound to the proper acceleration and to
another new model in which a similar quantity, called ``pseudo-acceleration'',
is bounded. With some simple choices of the fields, we illustrate some other
interesting properties of the models and we show that unwanted features may
appear, as unstable run-away solutions and unphysical values of the
energy-momentum or of the velocity.

Our analysis begins with a careful study of its minisuperspace limit

indecomposable representations. This is interpreted as a geometric signal for
the appearance of logarithms in the correlators of the full field theory. We
then discuss the representation theory of the gl(1|1) current algebra and
propose an Ansatz for the state space of the WZW model. The latter is
established through an explicit computation of the correlation function. We
show in particular, that the 4-point functions of the theory factorize on the
proposed set of states and that the model possesses an interesting spectral
flow symmetry. The note concludes with some remarks on generalizations to other
supergroups.

defined by a fixed multiplication pattern, which is inserted between the
Analysis and synthesis operators. The proposed concept unifies the approach
used for Gabor multipliers for arbitrary analysis/synthesis systems, which form
Bessel sequences, like wavelet or irregular Gabor frames. The basic properties
of this class of operators are investigated. In particular the implications of
summability properties of the symbol for the membership of the corresponding
operators in certain operator classes are specified. As a special case the
multipliers for Riesz bases are examined and it is shown that multipliers in
this case can be easily composed and inverted. Finally the continuous
dependence of a Bessel multiplier on the parameters (i.e. the involved
sequences and the symbol in use) is verified, using a special measure of
similarity of sequences.

  Detection of Coarse-Grained Bifurcations","submitted to CPC7, Lake Louise, Canada, January 8-13, 2006",,,,"nlin.CG",,"  We discuss certain basic features of the equation-free (EF) approach to
modeling and computation for complex/multiscale systems. We focus on links
between the equation-free approach and tools from systems and control theory
(design of experiments, data analysis, estimation, identification and
feedback). As our illustrative example, we choose a specific numerical task
(the detection of stability boundaries in parameter space) for stochastic
models of two simplified heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanisms. In the
equation-free framework the stochastic simulator is treated as an experiment
(albeit a computational one). Short bursts of fine scale simulation (short
computational experiments) are designed, executed, and their results processed
and fed back to the process, in integrated protocols aimed at performing the
particular coarse-grained task (the detection of a macroscopic instability).
Two distinct approaches are presented; one is a direct translation of our
previous protocol for adaptive detection of instabilities in laboratory
experiments (Rico-Martinez et al., 2003); the second approach is motivated from
numerical bifurcation algorithms for critical point detection. A comparison of
the two approaches brings forth a key feature of equation-free computation:
computational experiments can be easily initialized at will, in contrast to
laboratory ones.

low-lying excitations of a suitable energy functional. It is shown that the

ordinary mass. $\Delta H = D(H-H)$ is the chemical energy released in chemical
bond formation between two H atoms. The failure to recognize the enormously
different energy scales in those two equations reflected in current events may
start a chain reaction this very year, on the one-hundredths anniversary of
Einstein's discovery, that leads to the end of civilization. Due to the
confluence of a particular set of circumstances, this particular moment is more
dangerous than any other in the history of nuclear weapons. Physicists have a
special responsibility to do their utmost to prevent this from happening. This
paper is a call to arms. A principle to underpin nuclear non-proliferation and
enhance stability is advocated.

assuming a di quark identification for soliton-anti soliton constituent parts
of a scalar field. The intial potential system employed is semi classical in
nature, becoming non-classical at the end of chaotic inflation at the same time
cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological constant. We
use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero during initial
inflationary cosmology, and cange it afterwards as the slope of the scalar
field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid in a data
reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to
dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a
cut off value for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at
the cost of, especially in early universe theoretical models, of clearly
defined baryogenesis, and of a well defined mechanism of phase transitions. The
material below is now a proposal, in part accepted as a point of discussion as
a white paper (appropriately) submitted to the Dark Energy Task Force, in its

  ecology restricted by a conserved resource","18 pages and 9 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.OT",,"  We study a version of the Tangled Nature model of evolutionary ecology
redefined in a phenotype space where mutants have properties correlated to
their parents. The model has individual-based dynamics whilst incorporating
species scale competitive constraints and a system scale resource constraint.
Multiple species arise that coexist in a species interaction network with
evolving global properties. Both the mean interaction strength and the network
connectance increase relative to the null system as mutualism becomes more
extensive. From a study of the dependence of average degree on the resource
level we extract the diversity-connectance relationship which conforms to the
hyperbolic form seen in field data. This is adjudged to arise as a consequence
of the evolutionary pressure to achieve positive interactions. The network
degree distributions conform more strongly to exponential than to the null
binomial distributions in all cases. This effect is believed to be caused by
correlations in the reproductive process. We also study how resource
availability influences the phenotypical lifetime distribution which is
approximately of power law form. We observe that the mean lifetime is inversely
related to the resource level.

counterintuitive trends as parameters are varied, including the broadening of
indegree distribution when the probability for retaining input links is
decreased. We also find that both the scaling of transcription factors with
genome size and the measured degree distributions for genes in yeast can be
reproduced by the growth algorithm if and only if a special seed is used to
initiate the process.

nucleic acids is presented. Secondary structures and the topology of structure
elements are the level of resolution that is used. The folding model deals with
matches, mismatches, symmetric and asymmetric interior loops, stacked pairs in
loop and dangling end regions, multi-branched loops, bulges and single base
stacking that might exist at duplex ends or at the ends of helices.
Calculations on short and long sequences show, that for short oligonucleotides,
a duplex formation often displays a two-state transition. However, for longer
oligonucleotides, the thermodynamic properties of the single self-folding
transition affects the transition nature of the duplex formation, resulting in
a population of intermediate hairpin species in the solution. The role of
intermediate hairpin species is analyzed in the case when a short
oligonucleotides (molecular beacons) have to reliably identify and hybridize to
accessible nucleotides within their targeted mRNA sequences. It is shown that
the enhanced specificity of the molecular beacons is a result of their
constrained conformational flexibility and the all-or-none mechanism of their
hybridization to the target sequence.

consists in finding the optimal universal programmable detector, namely a
device that can be tuned to perform any desired measurement on a given quantum
system, by changing the state of an ancilla. With a finite dimension for the
ancilla only approximate universal programmability is possible, with minimal
dimension increasing function versus the precision of the approximation. We

up to this we also show how the problem can be formulated as a Schmidt number

strong evidence is given that all 1-copy undistillable Werner states are also
4-copy undistillable. (iv) The same method is used to estimate the volume of
