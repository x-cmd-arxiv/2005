and out of a region necessarily forms a caustic. A corollary is that, in cold
dark matter cosmology, galactic halos have inner caustics in addition to the
more obvious outer caustics. The outer caustics are fold catastrophes located
on topological spheres surrounding the galaxy. To obtain the catastrophe
structure of the inner caustics, we simulate the infall of cold collisionless
particles in a fixed gravitational potential. The structure of inner caustics
depends on the angular momentum distribution of the infalling particles. We
confirm a previous result that the inner caustic is a ""tricusp ring"" when the
initial velocity field is dominated by net overall rotation. A tricusp ring is
a closed tube whose cross section is a section of an elliptic umbilic
catastrophe. However, tidal torque theory predicts that the initial velocity
field is irrotational. For irrotational initial velocity fields, we find the
inner caustic to have a tent-like structure which we describe in detail in
terms of the known catastrophes. We also show how the tent caustic transforms
into a tricusp ring when a rotational component is added to the initial
velocity field.

10% of the quasar population have radio cores brighter than 0.75 mJy at 1.4

FR2 sources have a radio core (> 0.75 mJy). A significant fraction (~40%) of
the FR2 quasars are bent by more than 10 degrees, indicating either
interactions of the radio plasma with the ICM or IGM. We found no evidence for
correlations with redshift among our FR2 quasars: radio lobe flux densities and
radio source diameters of the quasars have similar distributions at low (mean
0.77) and high (mean 2.09) redshifts. Using a smaller high reliability FR2
sample of 422 quasars and two comparison samples of radio-quiet and non-FR2
radio-loud quasars, matched in their redshift distributions, we constructed
composite optical spectra from the SDSS spectroscopic data. Based on these
spectra we can conclude that the FR2 quasars have stronger high-ionization
emission lines compared to both the radio quiet and non-FR2 radio loud sources.
This is consistent with the notion that the emission lines are brightened by
ongoing shock ionization of ambient gas in the quasar host as the radio source
expands.

specific frequency of 5.8+/-1.4. The g-z color distribution of the GCs shows a
blue (metal-poor) peak with a tail of redder (metal-rich) clusters similar in
color to those seen in luminous ellipticals. Spectroscopy of a subsample of 12
GCs suggests that the GC system is old and coeval (~10 Gyr), with a fairly
broad metallicity distribution (-1.8<[m/H]<-0.8). In contrast, an integrated
spectrum of the underlying galaxy starlight reveals that its optical luminosity
is dominated by metal-rich, intermediate-aged stars. Radial velocities of the
GCs suggest rotation close to the major axis of the galaxy, and this rotation
is dynamically significant with (v/sigma)^* >1. A compilation of the kinematics
of the GC systems of 9 early-type galaxies shows surprising diversity in the
v/sigma parameter for GC systems. In this context, the GC system of VCC 1087
exhibits the most significant rotation to velocity dispersion signature.
Modeling the velocity dispersion profile of the GCs and galaxy stars suggest
fairly constant mass-to-light ratios of ~3 out to 6.5 kpc. The present
observations can entertain both baryonic and non-baryonic solutions, and GC
velocities at larger radii would be most valuable with regard to this issue. We
discuss the evolution of VCC 1087 in terms of the galaxy ``harassment''

version of quasi-linear theory to describe the diffusion of test particles is
proposed. The theory relies on the proviso that the injected energetic
particles are not trapped in the small-scale structure of magnetic fields
wrapping around and permeating a filament but deflected by the filaments, to
open a new regime of the energy hierarchy mediated by a transition compared to
the particle injection. The diffusion coefficient derived from a quasi-linear
type equation is applied to estimating the timescale for the stochastic
acceleration of particles by the shock wave propagating through the jet. The
generic scalings of the achievable highest energy of an accelerated ion and
electron, as well as of the characteristic time for conceivable energy

Lyman alpha emitters in a redshift space at z=3.1. We carried out spectroscopic
observations to map the three dimensional structure of the belt-like feature of
the Lyman alpha emitters discovered by our previous narrow-band imaging
observations centered on the protocluster at z=3.1. The feature was found to
consist of at least three physical filaments connecting with each other. The
result is in qualitative agreement with the prediction of the 'biased'
galaxy-formation theories that galaxies preferentially formed in large-scale
filamentary or sheet-like mass overdensities in the early Universe. We also
found that the two known giant Lyman alpha emission-line nebulae showing high
star-formation activities are located near the intersection of these filaments,
which presumably evolves into a massive cluster of galaxies in the local
Universe. This may suggest that massive galaxy formation occurs at the
characteristic place in the surrounding large-scale structure at high redshift.

the SCUBA camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Since SCUBA is sensitive
to the 90% of dust too cold to radiate significantly in the IRAS bands our new
sample represents the first unbiased survey of dust in galaxies along the whole
length of the Hubble sequence. We find little change in the properties of dust
in galaxies along the Hubble sequence and detected 6 out of 11 elliptical
galaxies. As in our earlier work on IRAS galaxies we find that the IRAS and
submm fluxes are well-fitted by a two-component dust model with dust emissivity

ratio of the mass of cold dust to the mass of warm dust is much higher for our
optically-selected galaxies and can reach values of ~1000. Comparison of the
results for the IRAS- and optically-selected samples shows that there is a
population of galaxies containing a large proportion of cold dust that is
unrepresented in the IRAS sample. We derive local submm luminosity and dust
mass functions, both directly from our optically-selected SLUGS sample, and by
extrapolation from the IRAS PSCz survey using the method of Serjeant &
Harrison, and find excellent agreement between the two. We find them to be
well-fitted by Schechter functions except at the highest luminosities. We find

repositioning of the central engine in each of these three radio sources is the
most plausible interpretation of the observed morphology and that a merger is
most likely the original cause of such a repositioning. In the case of TXS
1033+026, the optical image extracted from the SDSS archives clearly suggests
that two objects separated by only 2.7 kpc (projected onto the sky plane) are
indeed merging. The inner parts of TXS 0818+214 and TXS 1312+563 could be
interpreted as double-lobed, and consequently, these sources could be of the
double-double type; but further multifrequency observations are necessary to
provide support for such an interpretation.

flexible scheduling, Swift is extremely well-suited for monitoring the spectral
evolution of such an event. GRO J1655-40 was observed on 20 occasions and data
were obtained by all instruments for the majority of epochs. X-ray spectroscopy
revealed spectral shapes consistent with the ``canonical'' low/hard, high/soft
and very high states at various epochs. The soft X-ray source (0.3-10 keV) rose
from quiescence and entered the low/hard state, when an iron emission line was
detected. The soft X-ray source then softened and decayed, before beginning a
slow rebrightening and then spending $\sim 3$ weeks in the very high state. The
hard X-rays (14-150 keV) behaved similarly but their peaks preceded those of
the soft X-rays by up to a few days; in addition, the average hard X-ray flux
remained approximately constant during the slow soft X-ray rebrightening,
increasing suddenly as the source entered the very high state. These
observations indicate (and confirm previous suggestions) that the low/hard
state is key to improving our understanding of the outburst trigger and
mechanism. The optical/ultraviolet lightcurve behaved very differently from
that of the X-rays; this might suggest that the soft X-ray lightcurve is
actually a composite of the two known spectral components, one gradually
increasing with the optical/ultraviolet emission (accretion disc) and the other
following the behaviour of the hard X-rays (jet and/or corona).

for all objects, with the exception of those known to contain a warm absorber.
A single power-law is, however, a poor fit to the 0.3-10.0 keV spectrum and
instead we find that a simple model, consisting of a broken power-law (plus an
iron line), provides a reasonable fit in most cases. The equivalent width of
the emission line is constrained in just twelve objects but with low (<2 sigma)
significance in most cases. For the sources whose spectra are well-fit by the
broken power-law model, we find that various optical and X-ray line and
continuum parameters are well-correlated; in particular, the power-law photon
index is well-correlated with the FWHM of the Hbeta line and the photon indices
of the low and high energy components of the broken power-law are
well-correlated with each other. These results suggest that the 0.3-10 keV
X-ray emission shares a common (presumably non-thermal) origin, as opposed to
suggestions that the soft excess is directly produced by thermal disc emission
or via an additional spectral component. We present XMM-Newton/OM data which we
combine with the X-ray spectra so as to produce broad-band spectral energy
distributions, free from uncertainties due to long-term variability in
non-simultaneous data. Fitting these optical-UV spectra with a Comptonized disc
model indicates that the soft X-ray excess is independent of the accretion
disc, confirming our interpretation of the tight correlation between the hard
and soft X-ray spectra.

asteroseismology (where `mode' is to be understood in an astronomical rather
than in a statistical sense), which uses a time series of the first 3 moments
of a spectral line to estimate the discrete oscillation mode parameters l and
m. The method, contrary to many other mode identification techniques, also
provides estimates of other important continuous parameters such as the
inclination angle alpha, and the rotational velocity v_e. We developed a
statistical formalism for the moment method based on so-called generalized
estimating equations (GEE). This formalism allows the estimation of the
uncertainty of the continuous parameters taking into account that the different
moments of a line profile are correlated and that the uncertainty of the
observed moments also depends on the model parameters. Furthermore, we set up a
procedure to take into account the mode uncertainty, i.e., the fact that often
several modes (l,m) can adequately describe the data. We also introduce a new
lack of fit function which works at least as well as a previous discriminant
function, and which in addition allows us to identify the sign of the azimuthal
order m. We applied our method to the star HD181558, using several numerical
methods, from which we learned that numerically solving the estimating
equations is an intensive task. We report on the numerical results, from which
we gain insight in the statistical uncertainties of the physical parameters

functions for spin observables which probe lengthscales much larger than the
lattice spacing but smaller than the system size, and find that the asymptotic
fluctuation-dissipation ratio (FDR) X^inf is the same as for local observables.
This is consistent with our earlier results for the Ising model in dimension
d=1 and d=2. We also check that bond observables, both local and long-range,
give the same asymptotic FDR. In the second part of the paper the analysis is
extended to global observables, which probe correlations among all N spins.
Here non-Gaussian fluctuations arising from the spherical constraint need to be
accounted for, and we develop a systematic expansion in 1/sqrt{N} to do this.
Applying this to the global bond observable, i.e. the energy, we find that
non-Gaussian corrections change its FDR to a nontrivial value which we
calculate exactly for all dimensions d>2. Finally, we consider quenches from
magnetized initial states. Here even the FDR for the global spin observable,
i.e. the magnetization, is nontrivial. It differs from the one for unmagnetized
states even in d>4, signalling the appearance of a distinct dynamical
universality class of magnetized critical coarsening. For lower d the FDR is
irrational even to first order in 4-d and d-2, the latter in contrast to recent
results for the n-vector model.

the benefit of a triplet $f$-wave phase for a weak repulsive interchain

the formation of a charge-density-wave state when $g_1^\perp$ exceeds some

interchain forward scattering ($g_2^\perp$) are taken into account, the effect
of $g_2^\perp$ alone is found to frustrate nearest-neighbor interchain $d$- and

measurements show that the 'd' value of the carbon depends both on atomic
percentage of B in the carbon network and also on the preparation temperature.
Doping of boron increases the structural graphitic ordering of the films
prepared at lower temperatures. On the contrary for the films prepared at
higher temperatures the ordering deteriorates as the boron content increases.
The d.c electrical transport measurements on these amorphous conducting carbon
films show, doping induced metal-insulator transition via critical regime, in
the temperature interval of 1.3 K to 300K. Also the films in the insulating
regime show a crossover from Mott to ES VRH for T < 55K. Additional support to
this transition is evident from negative magnetoresistance in VRH regime when
the sample is deep inside the insulating side of MI transition. The calculated
value of density of states at Fermi level shows a gradual change with
corresponding variation in boron doping level, indicating a change in the
number of conducting pi electrons due to substitutional doping of boron in the
carbon network. However for the films exhibiting critical behaviour, the
magnetic field dependence of magnetoresistance was not as predicted by the
available theoretical models. Various calculated parameters like localization
length, density of states at the Fermi level and coulomb gap for insulating
samples were calculated from the experimental data.

  Insulating Side of MI Transition","in review",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Boron doped amorphous conducting carbon films show MI transition induced by
doping. In this paper we discuss the ac conductivity of the films, which lie on
the insulating side of MI transition. The ac conductivity data is analyzed as a
function of frequency as well as temperature for both real as well as imaginary
part of the conductivity data. The ac conductivity of these samples shows
enhanced interaction effect at low temperature. The conduction mechanism at
high frequency and at low temperature is due to the tunneling mechanism. At
intermediate temperatures and at moderate frequencies, the conductivity data is
in good agreement with extended pair approximation modified for interaction
effect. At high temperature and at low frequencies, the mechanism of ac
conductivity is similar to that of dc conduction. The conductivity data for the
insulating samples near the boundary of MI transition were analyzed using an RC
element model. While fitting the impedance data, a new type of constant phase
element (inductive instead of capacitive) was found to be appropriate. At
present the origin of this inductive CPE is not is clear but we believe its
origin is in the electron-electron interaction, which makes any attempt of
applied frequency a slower response. Our ac conductivity results are well
explained by tunneling models rather than hopping models.

filters or, equivalently, as time-frequency integral operators with finite
support in time and frequency. Such a characterization inherently assumes the
signals are narrowband and may not be appropriate for wideband signals. In this
paper time-scale characterizations are examined that are useful in wideband
time-varying channels, for which a time-scale integral operator is physically
justifiable. A review of these time-frequency and time-scale characterizations
is presented. Both the time-frequency and time-scale integral operators have a
two-dimensional discrete characterization which motivates the design of
time-frequency or time-scale rake receivers. These receivers have taps for both
time and frequency (or time and scale) shifts of the transmitted signal. A
general theory of these characterizations which generates, as specific cases,
the discrete time-frequency and time-scale models is presented here. The
interpretation of these models, namely, that they can be seen to arise from
processing assumptions on the transmit and receive waveforms is discussed. Out
of this discussion a third model arises: a frequency-scale continuous channel
model with an associated discrete frequency-scale characterization.

smallness of the QCD coupling constant which justifies restriction by the

which is currently discussed in connection with the non trivial zeros of the
Riemann zeta function. The smooth part of the Riemann counting formula of the
zeros is reproduced exactly. The zeros appear, not as eigenstates, but as
missing states in the spectrum, in agreement with Connes adelic approach to the
Riemann hypothesis. The model is exactly solvable and renormalizable, with a
cyclic Renormalization Group. These results are obtained by mapping the
Berry-Keating model into the Russian doll model of superconductivity. Finally,
we propose a generalization of these models in an attempt to explain the
oscillatory part of the Riemann's formula.

approximation. Our main theorem, Theorem 1.2, provides a bound on the distance
to normality for any nonnegative random vector. Theorem 1.2 requires
multivariate size bias coupling, which we discuss in studying the approximation
of distributions of sums of dependent random vectors. In the univariate case,
we briefly illustrate this approach for certain sums of nonlinear functions of
multivariate normal variables. As a second illustration, we show that the
multivariate distribution counting the number of vertices with given degrees in
certain random graphs is asymptotically multivariate normal and obtain a bound
on the rate of convergence. Both examples demonstrate that this approach may be
suitable for situations involving non-local dependence. We also present Theorem
1.4 for sums of vectors having a local type of dependence. We apply this
theorem to obtain a multivariate normal approximation for the distribution of
the random $p$-vector which counts the number of edges in a fixed graph both of
whose vertices have the same given color when each vertex is colored by one of
$p$ colors independently. All normal approximation results presented here do
not require an ordering of the summands related to the dependence structure.
This is in contrast to hypotheses of classical central limit theorems and
examples, which involve e.g., martingale, Markov chain, or various mixing
assumptions.

branching process $Z_n$ with offspring distribution $Y$, there exists a random
variable $X$ such that the probability $P(Z_n=0)$ of extinction of the $n$th
generation in the branching process equals the value obtained by optimally
stopping the sequence $X_1,...,X_n$, where these variables are i.i.d
distributed as $X$. Generalizations to the inhomogeneous and infinite horizon
cases are also considered. This correspondence furnishes a simple `stopping
rule' method for computing various characteristics of branching processes,
including rates of convergence of the $n^{th}$ generation's extinction
probability to the eventual extinction probability, for the supercritical,
critical and subcritical Galton-Watson process. Examples, bounds, further

  september 2005, submitted to NIMA",,"10.1016/j.nima.2006.08.055",,"physics.med-ph",,"  Image reconstruction in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is
affected by physical effects such as photon attenuation, Compton scatter and
detector response. These effects can be compensated for by modeling the
corresponding spread of photons in 3D within the system matrix used for
tomographic reconstruction. The fully 3D Monte Carlo (F3DMC) reconstruction
technique consists in calculating this system matrix using Monte Carlo
simulations. The inverse problem of tomographic reconstruction is then solved
using conventional iterative algorithms such as maximum likelihood expectation
maximization (MLEM). Although F3DMC has already shown promising results, its
use is currently limited by two major issues: huge size of the fully 3D system
matrix and long computation time required for calculating a robust and accurate
system matrix. To address these two issues, we propose to calculate the F3DMC
system matrix using a spatial sampling matching the functional regions to be
reconstructed. In this approach, different regions of interest can be
reconstructed with different spatial sampling. For instance, a single value is
reconstructed for a functional region assumed to contain uniform activity. To
assess the value of this approach, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed
using GATE. Results suggest that F3DMC reconstruction using functional regions
improves quantitative accuracy compared to the F3DMC reconstruction method
proposed so far. In addition, it considerably reduces disk space requirement
and duration of the simulations needed to estimate the system matrix. The
concept of functional regions might therefore make F3DMC reconstruction
practically feasible.

electron-nucleus and electron-electron coalescence. It is shown that the
solutions for the electron-nucleus coalescence correspond to the ground and
singly excited bound states, including triplet ones. The proper solutions at
small distances $R$ from the triple coalescence point were presented as the
second order expansion on R and lnR. The vanishing of the Fock's logarithmic

this expansion, unlike the case of electron-electron coalescence. On the basis
of the obtained boundary solutions the approximate wave function corresponding
to both coalescence lines have been proposed in the two-exponential form with

In the approach, we ascribe to each language a fitness function which depends

aforementioned model to examine the role of saturation of the fitness on the
language dynamics. We found that the dependence of the linguistic diversity on
the area after colonization displays a power law regime with a nontrivial

microarray gene expression data: the Bayesian principal component analysis

conclusion IFRAA appears to be the most reliable and accurate approach for

amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$) into oligomers is a key pathogenetic event
in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the pathologic folding and
oligomerization of A$\beta$ could be effective in the prevention and treatment
of AD. Here, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent,
we probe the initial stages of folding of a decapeptide segment of A$\beta$,
A$\beta_{21-30}$, shown experimentally to nucleate the folding process. In
addition, we examine the folding of a homologous decapeptide containing an
amino acid substitution linked to hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with
amyloidosis--Dutch type, [Gln22]A$\beta_{21-30}$. We find that: (i) when the
decapeptide is in water, hydrophobic interactions and transient salt bridges
between Lys28 and either Glu22 or Asp23 are important in the formation of a
loop in the Val24--Lys28 region of the wild type decapeptide; (ii) in the
presence of salt ions, salt bridges play a more prominent role in the
stabilization of the loop; (iii) in water with a reduced density, the
decapeptide forms a helix, indicating the sensitivity of folding to different
aqueous environments; (iv) the ``Dutch'' peptide in water, in contrast to the
wild type peptide, fails to form a long-lived Val24--Lys28 loop, suggesting
that loop stability is a critical factor in determining whether A$\beta$ folds
into pathologic structures. Our results are relevant to understand the
mechanism of A$\beta$ peptide folding in different environments, such as intra-
and extracellular milieus or cell membranes, and how amino acid substitutions
linked to familial forms of amyloidosis cause disease.
