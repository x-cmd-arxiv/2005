track as large a sample as possible and avoid introducing followup bias, we
have developed a multi-epoch observing strategy that is spread over several

their combined energy output in the 1.5$<z<3$ range exceeds the combined UV

of UV LF is differential depending on the UV luminosity; i.e., the number
density of luminous LBGs does not change significantly from z=5 to 3, while the
number density of faint (L<L*) galaxies increases by a factor of five. We also
found the signs of differential evolution within other observational results
for LBGs at z~5. UV-luminous objects show strong clustering, and they have weak
or no Lyman-alpha emissions while showing prominent metal absorption lines.
There is also a clear deficiency of objects with blue UV-optical colors for
those bright in rest-frame optical bands (from the Spitzer/IRAC data obtained
by the GOODS project). By the SED fitting using rest-frame optical to
near-infrared photometry data it is suggested that most luminous objects at z~5
have already accumulated stellar mass more than 10^10 Msun. We discuss that
this differential evolution might be understood as a consequence of the biased

metal absorption lines. We also identified 2 faint (z'>25.0) objects to be at

earlier than faint ones, suggesting biased star formation.

short-period p-mode pulsator of the EC14026 type. Its atmospheric parameters
place it at the common boundary between the empirical instability regions of
the EC14026 variables and the typically cooler long-period g-mode pulsators of
the PG1716 kind.
  [Aims.] We analyse and interpret the photometric variability of HS0702+6043
in order to explore its asteroseismological potential.
  [Methods.] We report on rapid wide band CCD photometric observations to
follow up on and confirm the serendipitous discovery of multiperiodic
long-period luminosity variations with typical time scales of ~1h in
HS0702+6043, in addition to the two previously known pulsations at 363s and
383s. In particular, we isolate a relatively low-amplitude (~4 mmag),
long-period (3538+-130s) light variation.
  [Results.] We argue that the most likely origin for this luminosity variation
is the presence of an excited g-mode pulsation. If confirmed, HS0702+6043 would
constitute a rare addition to the very select class of pulsating stars showing
simultaneously parts of their pressure and gravity mode pulsation spectra. The
asteroseismological potential of such stars is immense, and HS0702+6043 thus
becomes a target of choice for future investigations. While our discovery
appears consistent with the location of HS0702+6043 at the common boundary
between the two families of pulsating sdB stars, it does challenge theory's
current description of stability and driving mechanisms in pulsating B
subdwarfs.

measurements and first-principles calculations of the phonons in NVO, we
determine eleven phonons which can induce the observed spontaneous
polarization. Among these eleven phonons, we find that a few of them can
actually induce a significant dipole moment. Using the calculated atomic
charges, we find that the required distortion to induce the observed dipole
moment is very small (~0.001 \AA) and therefore it would be very difficult to
observe the distortion by neutron-powder diffraction. Finally, we identify the
derivatives of the exchange tensor with respect to atomic displacements which
are needed for a microscopic model of a spin-phonon coupling in NVO and which
we hope will be obtained from a fundamental quantum calculation such as LDA+U.
We also analyze two toy models to illustrate that the Dzyaloskinskii-Moriya

boson exchange effects may play an important role in the light pentaquarks. The

theory where all configurations are wrapped in an irreducible way on a

the spectrum of its Hamiltonian is discrete with finite multiplicity. The
construction is explicitly perfomed for a compact sector of the target space
being a $2g$ dimensional flat torus and the base manifold of the Supermembrane
a genus $g$ compact Riemann surface. The topological conditions on
configuration space work in such a way that the $g=2$ case may be interpreted
as the intersection of two D=11 Supermembranes over $g=1$ surfaces, with their
corresponding topological conditions. The discreteness of the spectrum is
preserved by the intersection procedure. Between the configurations satisfying
the topological conditions there are minimal configurations which describe
minimal immersions from the base manifold to the compact sector of the target
space. They allow to map the D=11 Supermembrane with topological conditions to
a symplectic noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. We analyze geometrical
properties of these configurations in the context of Supermembranes and
D-branes theories. We show that this class of configurations also minimizes the

bins so that the probability that a bin with n balls obtains the next ball is
proportional to f(n) for some function f. A commonly studied case where there
are two bins and f(n) = n^p for p > 0, and our goal is to study the fine
behavior of this process with two bins and a large initial number t of balls.
Perhaps surprisingly, Brownian Motions are an essential part of both our
proofs.
  For p>1/2, it was known that with probability 1 one of the bins will lead the
process at all large enough times. We show that if the first bin starts with
t+\lambda\sqrt{t} balls (for constant \lambda\in \R), the probability that it
always or eventually leads has a non-trivial limit depending on \lambda.
  For p\leq 1/2, it was known that with probability 1 the bins will alternate
in leadership. We show, however, that if the initial fraction of balls in one
of the bins is >1/2, the time until it is overtaken by the remaining bin scales
like \Theta({t^{1+1/(1-2p)}}) for p<1/2 and \exp(\Theta{t}) for p=1/2. In fact,
the overtaking time has a non-trivial distribution around the scaling factors,
which we determine explicitly.
  Our proofs use a continuous-time embedding of the balls-in-bins process (due
to Rubin) and a non-standard approximation of the process by Brownian Motion.
The techniques presented also extend to more general functions f.

Poloidal magnetic flux is expelled from the fluid by the poloidal flow.
Small-scale magnetic field structures are generated by turbulence in the flow.
The resulting magnetic power spectrum exhibits a power-law scaling consistent
with the equipartition of the magnetic field with a turbulent velocity field.
The magnetic power spectrum has an apparent knee at the resistive dissipation
scale. Large-scale eddies in the flow cause significant changes to the
instantaneous flow profile resulting in intermittent bursts of non-axisymmetric
magnetic fields, demonstrating that the transition to a dynamo is not smooth
