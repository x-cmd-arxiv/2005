place strong constraints on the formation and evolution of galaxies during the
first 1-2 Gyrs of the universe. Of particular interest are galaxies at z~6
since they represent the earliest epoch accessible by current high-efficiency
optical instrumentation. To this end, we have constructed a sample of 506 z~6
objects from all the deepest wide-area HST data (UDF, UDF-Parallel, and GOODS
fields). They have been used to construct an optimal determination of the
rest-frame continuum UV LF at z~6. Our LF extends to over 3 magnitudes below
L*, fainter than has been done at z~3. Over the interval z~6 to z~3, we find
strong evidence for evolution in the UV LF. Though constraints on the faint-end
slope remain modest (and are consistent with no-evolution), the characteristic
luminosity appears to have approximately doubled over the interval z~6 to z~3,
consistent with hierarchical expectations. Remarkably, this shift to lower
luminosities extends to even higher redshifts. Using all deep J+H NICMOS
observations (800 orbits in total), we have been able to demonstrate that the
bright end of the LF (>0.3L*) is at least 5 times lower at z~10 than at z~4,
with a similar deficit being established from our recent detections and first
statistical sample of z~7-8 galaxies using our UDF NICMOS data. In these
proceedings, we discuss what is known about the UV LF and UV luminosity density
at z~6-10 from current data and its evolution relative to z~3. We also describe
several exciting prospects for advance in this area over the next year.

empirical information on hidden, mixed-polarity magnetic fields at
subresolution scales in the (granular) upflowing regions of the `quiet' solar

depolarizing the rotational levels of MgH lines. This has the interesting
consequence that in the upflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere the
strength of the hidden magnetic field cannot be sensibly larger than 10 G,
assuming the simplest case of a single valued microturbulent field that fills
the entire upflowing photospheric volume. Alternatively, an equally good
theoretical fit to the observed scattering polarization amplitudes can be
achieved by assuming that the rate of depolarizing collisions is an order of
magnitude smaller than in the previous collisionally dominated case, but then
the required strength of the hidden field in the upflowing regions turns out to
be unrealistically high. These constraints reinforce our previously obtained
conclusion that there is a vast amount of hidden magnetic energy and unsigned
magnetic flux localized in the (intergranular) downflowing regions of the quiet

  Gravitational Wave Background","This submission was withdrawn by author(s)",,,,"astro-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compact object binaries, mostly double with dwarfs, are believed to be a
potential source of confusion-limited noise for the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA). In a specific frequency range, this noise may rise above the
instrumental noise sources and hence hinder detection of other types of
signals, e.g. extreme mass ratio inspirals of stellar mass objects into
supermassive black holes. In most previous studies only detached populations of
compact object binaries have been considered. Here, we investigate the
influence of Galactic populations of compact mass transferring binaries on the
shape and strength of the LISA signal and compare our results with the signal
for detached binaries only. Our population synthesis includes all binary
systems containing two compact remnants. It is found that 99.5% of these
systems are double white dwarfs, and therefore we consider only binaries
consisting of two white dwarfs when calculating the LISA signal. We find that
the mass transferring binaries contributing to the confusion limited noise
dominate the population of LISA systems by number (60%), due to their long
lifetimes (few Gyrs). However, due to the very specific physical properties of
mass transferring systems, it is found that their contribution to the noise is
negligible at low frequencies and detached systems will set the magnitude of
the confusion-limited signal in this range. However, the mass transferring
systems begin to dominate the signal at higher frequencies (f>6 mHz). The
transition frequency at which the confusion limited regime becomes important is
found at 4 mHz. The addition of mass transferring systems tends to slightly
increase the transition frequency (from 3.5 to 4 mHz).

synthetic model profiles for rotating stars to develop a method to estimate the
polar gravity for these stars, which we argue is a useful indicator of their
evolutionary status. We combine these results with projected rotational
velocity measurements obtained in a previous paper on these same open clusters.
We find that the more massive B-stars experience a spin down as predicted by
the theories for the evolution of rotating stars. Furthermore, we find that the
members of binary stars also experience a marked spin down with advanced
evolutionary state due to tidal interactions. We also derive non-LTE-corrected
helium abundances for most of the sample by fitting the He I 4026, 4387, 4471
lines. A large number of helium peculiar stars are found among cooler stars
with Teff < 23000 K. The analysis of the high mass stars (8.5 solar masses < M
< 16 solar masses) shows that the helium enrichment process progresses through
the main sequence (MS) phase and is greater among the faster rotators. This
discovery supports the theoretical claim that rotationally induced internal
mixing is the main cause of surface chemical anomalies that appear during the
MS phase. The lower mass stars appear to have slower rotation rates among the
low gravity objects, and they have a large proportion of helium peculiar stars.
We suggest that both properties are due to their youth. The low gravity stars
are probably pre-main sequence objects that will spin up as they contract.
These young objects very likely host a remnant magnetic field from their natal
cloud, and these strong fields sculpt out surface regions with unusual chemical
abundances.

star-to-star agreement within uncertainties, but the abundances of the three
coolest dwarfs (4573 < T_eff < 4834 K) evince an increase with decreasing
T_eff. Possible causes for the apparent trend are considered, including the
effects of over-dissociation of O-containing molecules. O abundances are
derived from the near-UV Lambda 3167 OH line in high-quality Keck/HIRES
spectra, and no such effects are found- indeed, the OH-based abundances show an
increase with decreasing T_eff, leaving the nature and reality of the cool
dwarf [O I]-based O trend uncertain. The mean relative O abundance of the six
warmest dwarfs (5075 < T_eff < 5978 K) is [O/H] = +0.14 +/- 0.02, and we find a

to the microlensing regime, in the pixel-lensing regime (crowded or unresolved
sources) the observables are the maximum excess flux of the source above a
background and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) time of the event. To
calculate lensing event distribution functions depending on these observables
for the specific case of M31, we use data from the literature to construct a
model of M31, reproducing consistently photometry, kinematics and stellar
population. We predict the halo- and self-lensing event rates for bulge and
disk stars in M31 and treat events with and without finite source signatures
separately. We use the M31 photon noise profile and obtain the event rates as a
function of position, field of view, and S/N threshold at maximum
magnification. We calculate the expected rates for WeCAPP and for a potential
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) lensing campaign. The detection of two events
with a peak signal-to-noise ratio larger than 10 and a timescale larger than 1
day in the WeCAPP 2000/2001 data is in good agreement with our theoretical

characteristics of WeCAPP and ACS. For the pixel-lensing regime, we derive the
probability distribution for the lens masses in M31 as a function of the FWHM

describe the best parameters for each model, after doing statistical tests on

spectroscopically-confirmed members and an estimated velocity dispersion of
150+/-60 km/s. The three other groups are in the foreground of the lens. These
groups contain ~10 confirmed members each, and are located at redshifts of
0.265, 0.426, and 0.520. Two of the three additional groups are centered
roughly on the lens system, while the third is centered ~1 arcminute south of
the lens. We find that each group provides an external convergence (kappa_ext)
of ~0.005--0.060, depending on the assumptions made in calculating the
convergence. For lens systems where no additional observables that can break
the mass-sheet degeneracy exist, the determination of H_0 will be biased high
by a factor of (1-kappa_ext)^{-1} if the external convergence is not properly

dispersion of the lensing galaxy has been measured, thus breaking the

the overall uncertainties due to large-scale structure (LSS) along the line of

simulations that include radiative cooling and heating by a UV background, star
formation, and feedback from supernovae and galactic winds. To test our
simulations, we examine the DLA `rate-of-incidence' as a function of halo mass,
galaxy apparent magnitude, and impact parameter. We find that the statistical
distribution of DLAs does not depend on the exact values of internal numerical
parameters that control the decoupling of hydrodynamic forces when the gas is
ejected from starforming regions. The DLA rate-of-incidence in our simulations
at z=3 is dominated by the faint galaxies with apparent magnitude R_AB < 25.5.
However, interestingly in a `strong wind' run, the differential distribution of
DLA sight-lines is peaked at Mhalo = 10^{12} Msun/h (R_AB~27), and the mean DLA
halo mass is Mmean=10^{12.4} Msun/h (R_AB ~ 26). These mass-scales are much
larger than those if we ignore winds, because galactic wind feedback suppresses
the DLA cross section in low-mass halos and increases the relative contribution
to the DLA incidence from more massive halos. The DLAs in our simulations are
more compact than the present-day disk galaxies, and the impact parameter
distribution is very narrow unless we limit the search for the host galaxy to
only bright LBGs. The comoving number density of DLAs is higher than that of
LBGs down to R_AB=30 mag if the physical radius of each DLA is smaller than 5
kpc/h_70. We discuss conflicts between current simulations and observations,
and potential problems with simulations based on the CDM model.

  Vancouver",,"10.1139/P06-066",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  The Standard Model of Particle Physics (SMPP) is an enormously successful
description of high energy physics, driving ever more precise measurements to
find ""physics beyond the standard model"", as well as providing motivation for
developing more fundamental ideas that might explain the values of its
parameters. Simultaneously, a description of the entire 3-dimensional structure
of the present-day Universe is being built up painstakingly. Most of the
structure is stochastic in nature, being merely the result of the particular
realisation of the ""initial conditions"" within our observable Universe patch.
However, governing this structure is the Standard Model of Cosmology (SMC),
which appears to require only about a dozen parameters. Cosmologists are now
determining the values of these quantities with increasing precision in order
to search for ""physics beyond the standard model"", as well as trying to develop
an understanding of the more fundamental ideas which might explain the values
of its parameters. Although it is natural to see analogies between the two
Standard Models, some intrinsic differences also exist, which are discussed
here. Nevertheless, a truly fundamental theory will have to explain both the
SMPP and SMC, and this must include an appreciation of which elements are
deterministic and which are accidental. Considering different levels of
stochasticity within cosmology may make it easier to accept that physical
parameters in general might have a non-deterministic aspect.

the existence of a reddened, E(B-V)=0.4(+/-)0 .1$, evolved stellar population

accretion disk in which heating by dissipation of MRI-driven MHD turbulence is
balanced by radiative cooling. Heating, radiative transport, and cooling are
computed self-consistently with the structure by solving the equations of
radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Using a fully 3-d and
energy-conserving code, we compute the structure of this disk segment over a
span of more than five cooling times. After a brief relaxation period, a
statistically steady-state develops. Measuring height above the midplane in
units of the scale-height H predicted by a Shakura-Sunyaev model, we find that
the disk atmosphere stretches upward, with the photosphere rising to about 7H,
in contrast to the approximately 3H predicted by conventional analytic models.
This more extended structure, as well as fluctuations in the height of the
photosphere, may lead to departures from Planckian form in the emergent
spectra. Dissipation is distributed across the region within roughly 3H of the
midplane, but is very weak at greater altitudes. Because fluctuations in the
dissipation are particularly strong away from the midplane, the emergent
radiation flux can track dissipation fluctuations with a lag that is only
0.1--0.2 times the mean cooling time of the disk. Long timescale asymmetries in
the dissipation distribution can also cause significant asymmetry in the flux
emerging from the top and bottom surfaces of the disk. Radiative diffusion
dominates Poynting flux in the vertical energy flow throughout the disk.

We find that the emission line clouds suffer substantially more extinction than
the starlight, and confirm the correlations between stellar and nebular
velocity dispersions and between emission line luminosity and velocity
dispersions. Nuclear luminosities correlate with stellar velocity dispersions.
Removing the contribution of young stars to the optical continuum produces a
tighter and steeper relation, $L \propto \sigma_\star^4$, consistent with the
Faber-Jackson law. Emission line ratios indicative of the gas excitation such
as [OIII]/H$\beta$ and [OIII]/[OII] are statistically smaller for Seyferts with
significant star-formation, implying that ionization by massive stars is
responsible for a substantial, and sometimes even a dominant, fraction of the
H$\beta$ and [OII] fluxes. We use our models to constrain the maximum fraction
of the ionizing power that can be generated by a hidden AGN. We correlate this
fraction with classical indicators of AGN photo-ionization: X-ray luminosity
and nebular excitation, but find no significant correlations. Thus, while there
is a strong contribution of starbursts to the excitation of the nuclear nebular
emission in low-luminosity Seyferts, the contribution of the hidden AGN remains
elusive even in hard X-rays. (abridged)

means of rf transitions between hyperfine states are strongly constrained by
the symmetry of the interatomic interactions. Such constraints are reflected in
the spin f-sum rule that the response functions must obey. In particular, only
if the effective interactions are not fully invariant in SU(2) spin space, are
the response functions sensitive to mean field and pairing effects. We
demonstrate, via a self-consistent calculation of the spin-spin correlation
function within the framework of Hartree-Fock-BCS theory, how one can derive a
correlation function explicitly obeying the f-sum rule. By contrast, simple
one-loop approximations to the spin response functions do not satisfy the sum
rule. As we show, the emergence of a second peak at higher frequency in the rf
spectrum, as observed in a recent experiment in trapped $^6\text{Li}$, can be
understood as the contribution from the paired fermions, with a shift of the
peak from the normal particle response proportional to the square of the BCS
pairing gap.

amorphous systems subjected to simple shear in the athermal, quasistatic limit.
The athermal quasistatic trajectories are shown to separate into smooth,
reversible elastic branches which are intermittently broken by discrete
catastrophic plastic events. The onset of a typical plastic event is studied
with precision, and it is shown that the mode of the system which is
responsible for the loss of stability has structure in real space which is
consistent with a quadrupolar source acting on an elastic matrix. The plastic
events themselves are shown to be composed of localized shear transformations
which organize into lines of slip which span the length of the simulation cell,
and a mechanism for the organization is discussed. Although within a single
event there are strong spatial correlations in the deformation, we find little
correlation from one event to the next, and these transient lines of slip are
not to be confounded with the persistent regions of localized shear --
so-called ""shear bands"" -- found in related studies. The slip lines gives rise
to particular scalings with system length of various measures of event size.
Strikingly, data obtained using three differing interaction potentials can be
brought into quantitative agreement after a simple rescaling, emphasizing the
insensitivity of the emergent plastic behavior in these disordered systems to
the precise details of the underlying interactions. The results should be
relevant to understanding plastic deformation in systems such as metallic
glasses well below their glass temperature, soft glassy systems (such as dense
emulsions), or compressed granular materials.

between charged arms on neighboring stars can compete with intra-star
interactions and rotational entropy to induce anisotropy in the orientational
distribution of arms. For model stars comprising rigid rodlike arms with evenly
spaced charged monomers interacting via an effective screened-Coulomb (Yukawa)
potential, we explore the influence of arm orientational anisotropy on
effective star-star interactions. Monte Carlo simulation and density-functional
theory are used to compute arm orientational distributions and effective pair
potentials between weakly charged stars. The degree of anisotropy is found to
increase with the strength of electrostatic interactions and proximity of the
stars. As two stars begin to overlap, the forward arms are pushed back by
inter-star arm-arm repulsion, but partially interdigitate due to rotational
entropy. At center-center separations approaching complete overlap, the arms
relax to an isotropic distribution. For nonoverlapping stars,
anisotropy-induced changes in intra- and inter-star arm-arm interactions
largely cancel and the effective pair interactions are then well approximated
by a simple Yukawa potential, as predicted by linear response theory for a
continuum model of isotropic stars [A. R. Denton, Phys. Rev. E 67, 11804

mechanical cells in which particles move around. In each cell, there is a
rotating disc, with which these particles interact, and this is the only

cells are weakly coupled, to a good approximation, the jump rates of particles
and the energy-exchange rates from cell to cell follow linear profiles. Here,
we refine that study by analyzing higher-order effects which are induced by the
presence of external gradients for situations in which memory effects, typical
of Hamiltonian dynamics, cannot be neglected. For the steady state we propose a
set of balance equations for the particle number and energy in terms of the
reflection probabilities of the cell and solve it phenomenologically. Using
this approximate theory we explain how these asymmetries affect various aspects
of heat and particle transport in systems of the general type described above
and obtain in the infinite volume limit the deviation from the theory in
\cite{eckmann-young} to first-order. We verify our assumptions with extensive
numerical simulations.

using a collective coordinate approach with two degrees of freedom, namely the
center of the soliton, $X(t)$, and its width, $l(t)$, we show, first, that
energy is inhomogeneously pumped into the system, generating as result a
directed motion; and, second, that the breaking of the time shift symmetry
gives rise to a resonance mechanism that takes place whenever the width $l(t)$
oscillates with at least one frequency of the external ac force. In addition,
we show that for the appearance of soliton ratchets, it is also necesary to
break the time-reversal symmetry. We analyze in detail the effects of
dissipation in the system, calculating the average velocity of the soliton as a
function of the ac force and the damping. We find current reversal phenomena
depending on the parameter choice and discuss the important role played by the
phases of the ac force. Our analytical calculations are confirmed by numerical
simulations of the full partial differential equations of the sine-Gordon and
$\phi^4$ systems, which are seen to exhibit the same qualitative behavior. Our
results are in agreement with recent experimental work on dissipation induced

topology-dependent address is a promising approach toward completely scalable
self-organizing networks. A group of proposals that have adopted such an
approach use the same structure to: address nodes, perform routing, and
implement location service. In this way, the consistency of the routing
protocol relies on the coherent sharing of the addressing space among all nodes
in the network. Such proposals use a logical tree-like structure where routes
in this space correspond to routes in the physical level. The advantage of
tree-like spaces is that it allows for simple address assignment and
management. Nevertheless, it has low route selection flexibility, which results
in low routing performance and poor resilience to failures. In this paper, we
propose to increase the number of paths using incomplete hypercubes. The design
of more complex structures, like multi-dimensional Cartesian spaces, improves
the resilience and routing performance due to the flexibility in route
selection. We present a framework for using hypercubes to implement indirect
routing. This framework allows to give a solution adapted to the dynamics of
the network, providing a proactive and reactive routing protocols, our major

in effective scalar field theories with certain effective potentials, which in

fine scales (in addition to a more efficient use of resources) together with
the higher accuracy furnished by higher order schemes when the solution is
adequately resolved. To define a convenient higher order adaptive mesh
refinement scheme, we discuss a few different modifications of the standard,
second order accurate approach of Berger and Oliger. Applying each of these

factor. In this TMD factorization, the transverse momenta of partons in the
$B$-meson are taken into account and all soft divergences are contained in the
wave function and the soft factor. The coefficient function is infrared-safe.
The factorization works on a diagram-by-diagram basis and is possible to extend
beyond one loop. With the factorization the large logarithms in the
perturbative function can be simply resummed. Our work shows that the result of
collinear factorization for the decay can be derived from that of TMD
factorization. Therefore, the two factorizations for the case here are simply
related to each other.

We assume that the scalar field satisfies the Robin boundary condition on the

to J. E. Andersen for these manifolds. For the case of Seifert manifolds with
base $S^2$ we actually prove a little weaker result, namely that the asymptotic
formula has a form as predicted by the AEC but contains some extra terms which
should be zero according to the AEC. We prove that these `extra' terms are
indeed zero if the number of exceptional fibers n is less than 4 and conjecture
that this is also the case if n is greater than 3. For the case of Seifert
fibered rational homology spheres we identify the Casson-Walker invariant in
the asymptotic formula.

asymptotics of a finite sum $\Sigma_{k=1}^{r} f(k)$, where f is a meromorphic
function depending on the integer parameter r and satisfying certain
symmetries. Basically the method, which is due to L. Rozansky, is based on a
limiting version of the Poisson summation formula together with an application

treatment: isothermal chemical remanence (CRM) or thermochemical remanence

present an exact linear stability theory of the synchronous state for networks

determined by multiple operators, for which standard analysis is not suitable.
We describe a general non-standard solution to the multi-operator problem.
Subsequently, we derive a class of rise functions for which all stability
operators become degenerate and standard eigenvalue analysis becomes a suitable
tool. Interestingly, this class is found to consist of networks of leaky
integrate and fire neurons. For random networks of inhibitory
integrate-and-fire neurons, we then develop an analytical approach, based on
the theory of random matrices, to precisely determine the eigenvalue
distribution. This yields the asymptotic relaxation time for perturbations to
the synchronous state which provides the characteristic time scale on which
neurons can coordinate their activity in such networks. For networks with
finite in-degree, i.e. finite number of presynaptic inputs per neuron, we find
a speed limit to coordinating spiking activity: Even with arbitrarily strong
interaction strengths neurons cannot synchronize faster than at a certain
maximal speed determined by the typical in-degree.

bigger than the dimensions of the Hilbert space of the multipartite system.
This necessary condition is very simple and general, and one can get many cases
of indistinguishability by it. It means that the least number of the product
states acts an important role in distinguishablity of states, and implies that
the least number of the product states may be an good manifestion of quantum
nonlocality in some sense. In fact, entanglement emphases the ""amount"" of
nonlocality, but the least number of the product states emphases the types of
nonlocality. For example, the known W states and GHZ states have different
least number of the product states, and are different in type.

"quant-ph/0510199","Claudio Garola","Claudio Garola","Truth and Completeness in Quantum Mechanics: A Semantic Viewpoint","15 pages, no figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The Einstein, Podolski and Rosen (EPR) argument aiming to prove the
incompleteness of quantum mechanics (QM) was opposed by most EPR's contemporary
physicists and is not accepted within the standard interpretation of QM, which
maintains that QM is a complete theory. An analysis of the semantic
implications of the opponent positions shows that they imply different notions
of truth. The introduction of a nonclassical notion of truth within the
standard interpretation is usually justified by referring to known theorems
that should prove that QM is a contextual and nonlocal theory. However, these
theorems are based on a doubtful implicit epistemological assumption. If one
renounces it, one can provide an alternative interpretation of QM that it
realistic in a semantic sense. Within this interpretation the EPR viewpoint is
recovered and QM is considered a (semantically) incomplete, noncontextual and
local theory. Furthermore, the new interpretation provides several suggestions
for constructing a more general theory embedding QM and for connecting QM with
classical physics and relativity.
