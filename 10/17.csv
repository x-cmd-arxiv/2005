  plasmas","Latex file",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Two theorems on the Riemannian geometrical constraints on vortex magnetic
filaments acting as dynamos in (MHD) flows are presented. The use of
Gauss-Mainard-Codazzi equations allows us to investigate in detail the
influence of curvature and torsion of vortex filaments in the MHD dynamos. This
application follows closely previous applications to Heisenberg spin equation
to the investigations in magnetohydrostatics given by Schief (Plasma Physics J.
10, 7, 2677 (2003)). The Lorentz force on vortex filaments are computed and the
ratio between the forces along different directions are obtained in terms of
the ratio between the corresponding magnetic fields which equals also the ratio
between the Frenet torsion and vortex line curvature. A similar relation
between Lorentz forces, magnetic fields and twist, which is proportional to
total torsion integral has been obtained by Ricca (Fluid Dyn. Res. 36,319
(2005)) in the case of inflexional desiquilibrium of magnetic flux-tubes. This
is due to the fact that the magnetic vortex lines are a limit case of the
magnetic flux-tubes when the lenght of the tube is much greater than the radius
of the tube. Magnetic helicity equation of the filament allows us again to
determine the magnetic fields ratio from Frenet curvature and torsion of the
vortex lines.

also presented. Comparison of our catalogs and images with the MSX mid-infrared

non-thermal sources. We identify 49 high-probability supernova remnant
candidates, increasing by a factor of seven the number of known remnants with
diameters smaller than 5 arcmin in the survey region; several are pulsar wind

the tentative identification of several hundred H II regions based on a
comparison with the mid-IR data; they range in size from unresolved
ultra-compact sources to large complexes of diffuse emission on scales of half
a degree. In several of the latter regions, cospatial nonthermal emission
illustrates the interplay between stellar death and birth. We comment briefly
on plans for followup observations and our extension of the survey; when
complemented by data from ongoing X-ray and mid-IR observations, we expect
MAGPIS to provide the most complete census yet obtained of the birth and death

that IC 225 is a typical dwarf elliptical galaxy. The g-r color profile
indicates a very blue core with a radius of 2 arcseconds, which is also clearly
seen in the RGB image made of g-, r- and i-band SDSS images. The SDSS optical
spectrum exhibits strong and very narrow nebular emission lines. The metal
abundances derived by the standard methods, which are 12+log(O/H) = 8.98,
log(N/O) = -0.77 and 12+log(S+/H+) = 6.76, turn out to be significantly higher

bluer than the nucleus of IC 225. The asymmetric line profiles of higher-order
Balmer lines indicate that the emission lines are bluer shifted relative to the

low-energy photon index, $\alpha$, ranges from 0 to -1 as the apparent viewing
angle goes from 0 to $\pi/2$. Thus, we interpret the hard-to-soft evolution and
the correlation of $\alpha$ with the photon flux observed in GRBs as a combined
effect of temporal variation of the viewing angle and relativistic aberration
of an individual thin, instantaneously illuminated shell. The model predicts
that about a quarter of time-resolved spectra should have hard spectra,
violating the synchrotron $\alpha=-2/3$ line of death. The model also naturally
explains why the peak of the distribution of $\alpha$ is at $\alpha\approx-1$.
The presence of a low-energy break in the jitter spectrum at oblique angles
also explains the appearance of a soft X-ray component in some GRBs and a
relatively small number of them. We emphasize that our theory is based solely

thick band of high pressure around the inner radio bubbles. The gas in the band
must be expanding outward and the sharp front to it is identified as a shock
front, yet we see no temperature jump across it; indeed there is more soft
emission behind the shock than in front of it. We conclude that in this inner
region either thermal conduction operates efficiently or the co-existing
relativistic plasma seen as the radio mini-halo is mediating the shock. If
common, isothermal shocks in cluster cores mean that we cannot diagnose the
expansion speed of radio bubbles from temperature measurements alone. They can
at times expand more rapidly than currently assumed without producing
significant regions of hot gas. Bubbles may also be significantly more
energetic. The pressure ripples found in earlier images are identified as
isothermal sound waves. A simple estimate based on their amplitude confirms
that they can be an effective distributed heat source able to balance radiative
cooling. We see multiphase gas with about 10^9 Msun at a temperature of about
0.5 keV. Much, but not all, of this cooler gas is spatially associated with the
optical filamentary nebula around the central galaxy, NGC 1275. A residual
cooling flow of about 50 Msun/yr may be taking place. A channel is found in the

Alpha Orionis. Infrared spectroscopy of red supergiants reveals strong
molecular bands, some of which do not originate in the photosphere but in a
cooler layer of molecular material above it. Lately, these layers have been
spatially resolved by near and mid-IR interferometry. In this paper, we try to
reconcile the IR interferometric and ISO-SWS spectroscopic results on Alpha
Orionis with a thorough modelling of the photosphere, molecular layer(s) and
dust shell. From the ISO and near-IR interferometric observations, we find that
Alpha Orionis has only a very low density water layer close above the
photosphere. However, mid-IR interferometric observations and a narrow-slit
N-band spectrum suggest much larger extra-photospheric opacity close to the
photosphere at those wavelengths, even when taking into account the detached
dust shell. We argue that this cannot be due to the water layer, and that
another source of mid-IR opacity must be present. We show that this opacity
source is probably neither molecular nor chromospheric. Rather, we present
amorphous alumina (Al2O3) as the best candidate and discuss this hypothesis in
the framework of dust-condensation scenarios.

the e+e- annihilation emission line of unprecedented quality, showing that most
of the photons arise from a region coinciding with the stellar bulge of the
Milky Way. The impressive intensity (10^-3 photon/cm^2/s) and morphology (round
and wide) of the emission is begging an explanation. Different classes of
astrophysical objects could inject positrons in the interstellar medium of the
bulge, but the only acceptable ones should inject them at energies low enough
to avoid excessive bremsstrahlung emission in the soft gamma ray regime. Among
the ~ MeV injectors, none seems generous enough to sustain the high level of
annihilation observed. Even the most profuse candidate, namely the beta+
radioactivity of 56 Co nuclei created and expelled in the interstellar medium
by explosive nucleosynthesis of type Ia supernovae, falls short explaining the
phenomenon due to the small fraction of positrons leaking out from the ejecta
(3 %), together with the low SNIa rate in the bulge (0.03 per century).
  It is therefore worth exploring alternative solutions, as for instance, the
idea that the source of the positrons is the annihilation of light dark matter
(LDM) particles of the kind recently proposed, totally independently, by Boehm
and Fayet. Assuming that LDM is the culprit, crucial constraints on the
characteristics (mass and annihilation cross-section) of the associated
particle may be discussed, combining direct gamma ray observations and models
of the early Universe. In particular, the mass of the LDM particles should be
significantly less than 100 MeV, so that the e+ and e- resulting from their
annihilations do not radiate exceedingly through bremsstrahlung in the
interstellar gas of the galactic bulge.

using six coupled equations for six order parameters: average displacement, its

fluctuations, average pyroelectric coefficient, its fluctuation and correlation
with charge defects density fluctuations. Coupled equations demonstrate the
inhomogeneous reversal of pyroelectric response in contrast to the equations of
Landau-Khalatnikov type, which describe the homogeneous reversal with the sharp
pyroelectric coefficient peak near the thermodynamic coercive field value.
Within the framework of our model pyroelectric hysteresis loop becomes much
smoother, thinner and lower as well as pyroelectric coefficient peaks near the
coercive field completely disappear under the increase of disordering caused by
defects. This effect is similar to the well-known ""square to slim transition""
of the ferroelectric hysteresis loops in relaxor ferroelectrics. Also the
increase of defect concentration leads to the drastic decrease of the coercive
field typical for disordered ferroelectrics. Usually pyroelectric hysteresis
loops of doped and inhomogeneous ferroelectrics have typical smooth shape
without any pyroelectric coefficient peaks and coercive field values much lower
than the thermodynamic one. Therefore our approach qualitatively explains
available experimental results. Rather well quantitative agreement between our

(frame/coframe) variables and which field models can be related to this
geometry. The coframe field models, alternative to GR, are known as viable
models for gravity, since they have the Schwarzschild solution. Since the local
Lorentz invariance is violated, a physical interpretation of additional six
degrees of freedom is required. The geometry of such models is usually given by
two different connections -- the Levi-Civita symmetric and metric-compatible
connection and the Weitzenbock flat connection. We construct a general family
of linear connections of the same type, which includes two connections above as
special limiting cases. We show that for dynamical propagation of six
additional degrees of freedom it is necessary for the gauge field of
infinitesimal transformations (antisymmetric tensor) to satisfy the system of
two first order differential equations. This system is similar to the vacuum
Maxwell system and even coincides with it on a flat manifold. The corresponding
``Maxwell-compatible connections'' are derived. Alternatively, we derive the
same Maxwell-type system as a symmetry conditions of the viable models
Lagrangian. Consequently we derive a nontrivial decomposition of the coframe
field to the pure metric field plus a dynamical field of infinitesimal Lorentz
rotations. Exact spherical symmetric solution for our dynamical field is
derived. It is bounded near the Schwarzschild radius. Further off, the solution
is close to the Coulomb field.

approximation assumes that the external universe changes slowly relative to the
rotation rate of the hole, thus allowing the parameterization of the
Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_0$ by time-dependent electric and magnetic tidal
tensors. This approximation, however, does not constrain how big the spin of
the background hole can be and, in principle, the perturbed metric can model
rapidly spinning holes. We first generate a potential by acting with a
differential operator on $\psi_0$. From this potential we arrive at the metric
perturbation by use of the Chrzanowski procedure in the ingoing radiation
gauge. We provide explicit analytic formulae for this metric perturbation in
spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, where the perturbation is finite at the
horizon. This perturbation is parametrized by the mass and Kerr spin parameter
of the background hole together with the electric and magnetic tidal tensors
that describe the time evolution of the perturbation produced by the external
universe. In order to take the metric accurate far away from the hole, these
tidal tensors should be determined by asymptotically matching this metric to
another one valid far from the hole. The tidally perturbed metric constructed
here could be useful in initial data constructions to describe the metric near
the horizons of a binary system of spinning holes. This perturbed metric could
also be used to construct waveforms and study the absorption of mass and
angular momentum by a Kerr black hole when external processes generate

post-Newtonian parametrized Einstein and light geodesics equations to show that
the `extrinsic' gravimagnetic field generated by the translational current of
matter can be measured by observing the relativistic time delay and/or light
deflection caused by the moving mass. We prove that the `extrinsic'
gravimagnetic field is generated by the relativistic effect of the aberration
of the gravity force caused by the Lorentz transformation of the metric tensor
and the Levi-Civita connection. We show that the Lorentz transformation of the
gravity field variables is equivalent to the technique of the retarded
Lienard-Wiechert gravitational potentials predicting that a light particle is
deflected by gravitational field of a moving body from its retarded position so
that both general-relativistic phenomena -- the aberration and the retardation
of gravity -- are tightly connected and observing the aberration of gravity
proves that gravity has a causal nature. We explain in this framework the 2002
deflection experiment of a quasar by Jupiter where the aberration of gravity
from its orbital motion was measured with accuracy 20%. We describe a theory of

cosmological perturbation theory in an inflationary background, taken to be a

sense that we evaluate the effect of the superhorizon second order corrections
on the inhomogeneous and homogeneous modes of the linearized flucuations. These
second order corrections enter in the form of a {\it cumulative} contribution
from {\it all} of their Fourier modes. In order to quantify their physical
significance we study their effective equation of state by looking at the
perturbed energy density and isotropic pressure to second order. We define the
energy density (isotropic pressure) in terms of the (averaged) eigenvalues
associated with timelike (spacelike) eigenvectors of a total stress energy for
the metric and matter fluctuations. Our work suggests that that for many
parameters of slow-roll inflation, the second order contributions to these
energy density and pressures may dominate over the first order effects for the
case of super-Hubble evolution. These results hold in our choice of first and
second order coordinate conditions however we also argue that other
`reasonable` coordinate conditions do not alter the relative importance of the
second order terms. We find that these second order contributions approximately
take the form of a cosmological constant in this coordinate gauge, as found by
others using effective methods.

pass through the shock wave, where they may encounter one or more resonances
corresponding to $\Delta m^2_{\rm atm}$. The neutrino mass eigenstates in
matter may stay coherent between these multiple resonances, giving rise to
oscillations in the survival probabilities of neutrino species. We provide an
analytical approximation to these inevitable phase effects, that relates the
density profile of the shock wave to the oscillation pattern. The phase effects
are present only if the multiple resonances encountered by neutrinos are
semi-adiabatic, which typically happens for $10^{-5} \lsim \sin^2 \theta_{13}
\lsim 10^{-3}$. The observability of these oscillations is severely limited by
the inability of the detectors to reconstruct the neutrino energy faithfully.
For typical shock wave profiles, the detection of these phase effects seems
rather unlikely. However, if the effects are indeed identified in the $\nuebar$
spectra, they would establish inverted hierarchy and a nonzero value of
$\theta_{13}$.

three-dimensional spherical shell. We compute the expectation value of the
Wilson loop operator and confirm the Coulombic behaviour of the heavy
quark-antiquark potential in the conformal case. When the vev is turned on we
find situations where a complete screening of the potential arises, as well as
a confining regime where a linear or a logarithmic potential prevails depending
on the ratio of the quark-antiquark separation to the typical vev scale. The
spectra of massless excitations on these backgrounds are analyzed by turning
the associated differential equations into Schrodinger problems. We find
explicit solutions taking into account the entire tower of states related to
the reduction of type-IIB supergravity to five dimensions, and hence we go
beyond the s-wave approximation that has been considered before for the
undeformed case. Arbitrary values of the deformation parameter give rise to the
Heun differential equation and the related Inozemtsev integrable system, via a

  The homotopy coniveau tower construction extends to a tower of functors on

also show that the 0th layer for the motivic sphere spectrum is the motivic

density of normal nuclear matter (NM). For a microscopic calculation of the

the symmetry part of the nuclear EOS, we have used the isovector coupling to
link the isospin dependence of the proton optical potential to the cross

that Brown-Rho scaling is valid. To make this argument we discuss the evolution
in time of the excited hadronic system and suggest that the system is
deconfined at the earliest times and becomes confined when the density and

the properties of the deconfined and confined systems in the experimental data.

air conductivity, related to the total ion number concentration, and (2) the

principles of air ion instrumentation are long-established. A recent
development is the computerised aspirated capacitor, which measures ions from
(a) the current of charged particles at a sensing electrode, and (b) the rate
of charge exchange with an electrode at a known initial potential, relaxing to
a lower potential. As the voltage decays, only ions of higher and higher
mobility are collected by the central electrode and contribute to the further
decay of the voltage. This enables extension of the classical theory to
calculate ion mobility spectra by inverting voltage decay time series. In
indoor air, ion mobility spectra determined from both the novel voltage decay
inversion, and an established voltage switching technique, were compared and
shown to be of similar shape. Air conductivities calculated by integration
were: 5.3 +- 2.5 fS/m and 2.7 +- 1.1 fS/m respectively, with conductivity
determined to be 3 fS/m by direct measurement at a constant voltage.

  topography","submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics 7 Oct 2005",,,,"physics.ao-ph",,"  Scattering of random surface gravity waves by small amplitude topography in
the presence of a uniform current is investigated theoretically. This problem
is relevant to ocean waves propagation on shallow continental shelves where
tidal currents are often significant. A perturbation expansion of the wave
action to second order in powers of the bottom amplitude yields an evolution
equation for the wave action spectrum. A scattering source term gives the rate
of exchange of the wave action spectrum between wave components, with
conservation of the total action at each absolute frequency. With and without
current, the scattering term yields reflection coefficients for the amplitudes
of waves that converge, to the results of previous theories for monochromatic
waves propagating in one dimension over sinusoidal bars. Over sandy continental
shelves, tidal currents are known to generate sandwaves with scales comparable
to those of surface waves. Application of the theory to such a real topography
suggests that scattering mainly results in a broadening of the directional wave
spectrum, due to forward scattering, while the back-scattering is generally
weaker. The current may strongly influence surface gravity wave scattering by
selecting different bottom scales with widely different spectral densities due
the sharp bottom spectrum roll-off.

energy. The difference of relativistic mechanics from classical mechanics is
due to the new definition of momentum that is proportional to energy and
velocity. It is shown that new relativistic laws of dynamics make it necessary
to change kinematical relations of classical mechanics such as the law of
velocity composition, coordinate transformation etc. It is demonstrated that
quantum mechanics may be considered as a rational statistical generalization of
classical mechanics. Statistical conformities in quantum mechanics are
fundamental and are not due to the incomplete information about the system.
  From all possible multi-parametric statistical models the root model is most
remarkable. Constructing of a root multi-parametric statistical model leads to
obtaining such frequencies and base functions in Fourier decomposition so that
classical laws of motion are fulfilled in average. Root model leads to a
consistent condition that connects eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a mechanical
system that is described by a matrix equation of Heisenberg. Matrix equation of
Heisenberg leads to an operator equation. The solution of the operator equation
may be considered as the construction of Hamiltonian of the system and a move
to the Schrodinger representation. The considered approach naturally leads to
the notion of momentum operator, fundamental commutation relations, density
matrix and Liouville equation construction etc.

understand principles of community organisation as well as to conserve species
in montane regions. This study examined the patterns of species richness,
abundance, composition, range sizes, and distribution of rainforest birds at 14
sites along an elevational gradient (500-1400 m) in the Kalakad-Mundanthurai
Tiger Reserve (KMTR) of the Western Ghats, India. In contrast to theoretical
expectation, resident bird species richness did not change significantly with
elevation although the species composition changed substantially (<10%
similarity) between the lowest and highest elevation sites. Constancy in
species richness was possibly due to relative constancy in productivity and
lack of elevational trends in vegetation structure. Elevational range size of
birds, expected to increase with elevation according to Rapoport's rule, was
found to show a contrasting inverse U-shaped pattern because species with
narrow elevational distributions, including endemics, occurred at both ends of
the gradient (below 800 m and above 1,200 m). Bird species composition also did
not vary randomly along the gradient as assessed using a hierarchy of null
models of community assembly, from completely unconstrained models to ones with
species richness and range-size distribution restrictions. Instead, bird
community composition was significantly correlated with elevation and tree
species composition of sites, indicating the influence of deterministic factors
on bird community structure. Conservation of low- and high-elevation areas and
maintenance of tree species composition against habitat alteration are
important for bird conservation in the southern Western Ghats rainforests.

would be instantly tunneling from one light cone into another on the distance
$c| \Delta\tau| $. (This assertion, previously proved via dispersion relations,
is described here by the temporal parameters of process.) Special forms of
these relations describe the transmutation of particles into their partners of
bigger mass, in $K^{0}$ and $B^{0}$ cases and at the $\nu$'s transmutations.
Thus, the violations of relativistic causality by evanescent particles can be
considered as the tunneling, as an analog of the short-term violation of
conservation laws at virtual transitions. The absence of Lorentz invariance at
such transitions can, probably, allow violations of some other symmetries.

and loss of coherence of the statistical operator describing the center of mass
degrees of freedom of a quantum system interacting through momentum transfer
events with an environment is established. The relationship with microphysical
models and recent experiments is considered, focusing on the recently observed
transition between a dynamics described by a compound Poisson process and a
Gaussian process.

  Analysis: From Foundations to Applications, QP-PQ Vol.18, eds. M. Schurmann
  and U. Franz, (World Scientific, 2005), p. 174-200",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Algebraic random walks (ARW) and quantum mechanical random walks (QRW) are
investigated and related. Based on minimal data provided by the underlying
bialgebras of functions defined on e. g the real line R, the abelian finite
group Z_N, and the canonical Heisenberg-Weyl algebra hw, and by introducing
appropriate functionals on those algebras, examples of ARWs are constructed.
These walks involve short and long range transition probabilities as in the
case of R walk, bistochastic matrices as for the case of Z_N walk, or coherent
state vectors as in the case of hw walk. The increase of classical entropy due
to majorization order of those ARWs is shown, and further their corresponding
evolution equations are obtained. Especially for the case of hw ARW, the
diffusion limit of evolution equation leads to a quantum master equation for
the density matrix of a boson system interacting with a bath of quantum
oscillators prepared in squeezed vacuum state. A number of generalizations to
other types of ARWs and some open problems are also stated. Next, QRWs are
briefly presented together with some of their distinctive properties, such as
their enhanced diffusion rates, and their behavior in respect to the relation
of majorization to quantum entropy. Finally, the relation of ARWs to QRWs is
investigated in terms of the theorem of unitary extension of completely
positive trace preserving (CPTP) evolution maps by means of auxiliary vector
spaces. It is applied to extend the CPTP step evolution map of a ARW for a
quantum walker system into a unitary step evolution map for an associated QRW
of a walker+quantum coin system. Examples and extensions are provided.

on the thermal entanglement in a two-spin-qutrit system by applying the concept
of negativity. It is found that the nonlinear couplings favor the thermal
entanglement creating. Only when the nonlinear couplings $|K|$ are larger than
a certain critical value does the entanglement exist. The dependence of the
thermal entanglement in this system on the magnetic field and temperature is
also presented. The critical magnetic field increases with the increasing
nonlinear couplings constant $|K|$. And for a fixed nonlinear couplings
constant, the critical temperature is independent of the magnetic field $B$.
