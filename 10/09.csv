than 0.3'' in the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra Deep Field (UDF) are generally
exponential, whereas the major axis profiles in irregular disk galaxies, called
clump-clusters in our previous studies, are clearly not. Here we show that the
deprojected positions of star-forming clumps in both galaxy types are
exponential, as are the deprojected luminosity profiles of the total emissions
from these clumps. These exponentials are the same for both types when
normalized to the outer isophotal radii. The results imply that clumps form or
accrete in exponential radial distributions, and when they disperse they form
smooth exponential disks. The exponential scale lengths for UDF spirals average
1.5 kpc for a standard cosmology. This length is smaller than the average for
local spirals by a factor of 2. Selection effects that may account for this
size difference among spirals are discussed. Regardless of these effects, the
mere existence of small UDF galaxies with grand-design spiral arms differs
significantly from the situation in local fields, where equally small disks are
usually dwarf Irregulars that rarely have spiral arms. Spiral arms require a
disk mass comparable to the halo mass in the visible region -- something local
spirals have but local dwarfs Irregulars do not. Our UDF result then implies
that galaxy disks grow from the inside out, starting with a dense halo and
dense disk that can form spiral arms, and then adding lower density halo and
disk material over time. Bars that form early in such small, dense, gas-rich
disks should disperse more quickly than bars that form later in fully developed
disks.

include gravitational and radiative fields to produce heated pressure-driven
outflows with magneto-centrifugal acceleration and collimation. Outflow
solutions with negligible or vanishing magnetic field are reported. They
indicate that thermodynamics is a sufficient engine to generate an outflow. The
magnetized solutions show dynamically significant differences in the axial
region, precisely where the radial velocity and collimation are the largest.
They compare quantitatively well with observations. The influence of the
opacity on the transit solutions is also studied. It is found that, when dust
is not the dominant coolant, such as in the primordial universe, mass infall
rates have substantial larger values in the equatorial region. This suggests
that star forming in a dust-free environment should be able to accrete much
more mass and become more massive than present day protostars.It is also
suggested that molecular outflows may be dominated by the global transit of
material around the protostar during the very early stages of star formation,

within a factor of 2. Theory predicts that P^{4+} is the dominant ion in the
winds of O7-O9.7 stars, though an empirical estimator suggests that the range
from O4-O7 may be more appropriate. However, we find that the mass-loss rates
obtained from P V wind profiles are systematically smaller than those obtained
from fits to Halpha emission profiles or radio free-free emission by median
factors of about 130 (if P^{4+} is dominant between O7 and O9.7) or about 20

reconciled if the winds of O stars in the relevant temperature range are
strongly clumped on small spatial scales. We use a simplified two-component
model to investigate the volume filling factors of the denser regions. This
clumping implies that mass-loss rates determined from ""density squared""

mean metallicity of the stellar halo, estimated using the mean colors of
red-giant branch stars, correlates with the parent galaxy luminosity. The
metallicity of the Milky Way halo falls nearly 1 dex below this

the exception than the rule for spiral galaxies; i.e., massive spirals with
metal-poor halos are unusual. The luminosity-halo stellar abundance relation is

  15-21 August, 2005","Bulg.J.Phys.33:217,2006",,,"gr-qc hep-th quant-ph",,"  Quantum mechanics in its presently known formulation requires an external
classical time for its description. A classical spacetime manifold and a
classical spacetime metric are produced by classical matter fields. In the
absence of such classical matter fields, quantum mechanics should be formulated
without reference to a classical time. If such a new formulation exists, it
follows as a consequence that standard linear quantum mechanics is a limiting
case of an underlying non-linear quantum theory. A possible approach to the new
formulation is through the use of noncommuting spacetime coordinates in
noncommutative differential geometry. Here, the non-linear theory is described
by a non-linear Schrodinger equation which belongs to the Doebner-Goldin class
of equations, discovered some years ago. This mass-dependent non-linearity is
significant when particle masses are comparable to Planck mass, and negligible
otherwise. Such a non-linearity is in principle detectable through experimental
tests of quantum mechanics for mesoscopic systems, and is a valuable empirical
probe of theories of quantum gravity. We also briefly remark on the possible
connection our approach could have with loop quantum gravity and string theory.

contribution, which phenomenologically parametrizes the UV renormalon effect
into the PT series, we obtain the invariant mass m_s=(119 +- 17)MeV leading to:
m_s(2 GeV)=(104+- 15)MeV. Combining this value with the recent and independent
phenomenological determinations from some other channels, to order alpha_s^3

vector] channels leads to the lower [resp. upper] bounds of m_s(2 GeV): (71 +-
4) MeV < m_s(2 GeV) < (151 +- 14) MeV, to order alpha_s^3. Using the ChPT mass
ratio r_3 = 2m_s/(m_u+m_d)=24.2 +- 1.5, and the average value of m_s, we
deduce:
  (m_u+m_d)(2 GeV)=(7.9 +- 0.6) MeV, consistent with the pion sum rule result,
which, combined with the ChPT value for m_u/m_d, gives: m_d(2 GeV)=(5.1 +-

sum rule and the average value of m_s (without the pion sum rule), the method
gives: r_3= 23.5 +- 5.8 in perfect agreement with the ChPT ratio, indicating
the self-consistency of the sum rule results. Using the value: m_b(m_b)=(4.23

the free energy in terms of an $N\times N$ Hankel determinant. Paul Zinn-Justin
observed that the Izergin-Korepin formula can be re-expressed in terms of the
partition function of a random matrix model with a nonpolynomial interaction.
We use this observation to obtain the large $N$ asymptotics of the six-vertex
model with DWBC in the disordered phase. The solution is based on the
Riemann-Hilbert approach and the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method.
As was noticed by Kuperberg, the problem of enumeration of alternating sign
matrices (the ASM problem) is a special case of the the six-vertex model. We
compare the obtained exact solution of the six-vertex model with known exact
results for the 1, 2, and 3 enumerations of ASMs, and also with the exact
solution on the so-called free fermion line. We prove the conjecture of
Zinn-Justin that the partition function of the six-vertex model with DWBC has
the asymptotics, $Z_N\sim CN^\kappa e^{N^2f}$ as $N\to\infty$, and we find the
exact value of the exponent $\kappa$.

paraxial approximation, the Talbot images are formed at distances z=p/q, where
p and q are coprimes, and are superpositions of q equally spaced images of the
original binary transmission (Ronchi) grating. This interpretation offers the
possibility to express the Talbot effect through Gauss sums. Here, we pay
attention to the Talbot effect in the case of dispersion in optical fibers
presenting our considerations based on the close relationships of the
mathematical representations of diffraction and dispersion. Although dispersion
deals with continuous functions, such as gaussian and supergaussian pulses,
whereas in diffraction one frequently deals with discontinuous functions, the
mathematical correspondence enables one to characterize the Talbot effect in
the two cases with minor differences. In addition, we apply, for the first time
to our knowledge, the wavelet transform to the fractal Talbot effect in both
diffraction and fiber dispersion. In the first case, the self similar character
of the transverse paraxial field at irrational multiples of the Talbot distance
is confirmed, whereas in the second case it is shown that the field is not self
similar for supergaussian pulses. Finally, a high-precision measurement of
irrational distances employing the fractal index determined with the wavelet
transform is pointed out

value to products and services? We propose the creation of the Donation-Payment
card as a solution to the legal and moral issues plaguing the emerging
anonymous, direct-to-consumer, stored-value prepaid (SVP) card market. Our
proposal to redirect millions of dollars whose status is in conflict not only
improves society and empowers people, but also represents the best free-market
solution to the SVP-Cards industry. The Donation-Payment card kills two birds
with one stone by marrying business interests with societal benefits. In
addition, think of the state of mind of a grand-parent giving a SVP-card to a
grand-child, who also feels like ""killing two birds with one stone"" or should
we say more aptly feels like ""giving twice with one card"".

cycle of periodical cicadas.Changed the viewpoint to predators rather than the
prey,this model fits reality very well by utilizing some principles and
assumption.With the definition of the predator income,natural selection from
predators seems to be the main reason for such a long life cycle.Consequent
solution of this model is exactly the fact of real nature.

  and Decay","27 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1016/j.aop.2006.02.016",,"quant-ph",,"  Many useful concepts for a quantum theory of scattering and decay (like
Lippmann-Schwinger kets, purely outgoing boundary conditions, exponentially
decaying Gamow vectors, causality) are not well defined in the mathematical
frame set by the conventional (Hilbert space) axioms of quantum mechanics.
Using the Lippmann-Schwinger equations as the takeoff point and aiming for a
theory that unites resonances and decay, we conjecture a new axiom for quantum
mechanics that distinguishes mathematically between prepared states and
detected observables. Suggested by the two signs $\pm i\epsilon$ of the
Lippmann-Schwinger equations, this axiom replaces the one Hilbert space of
conventional quantum mechanics by two Hardy spaces. The new Hardy space theory
automatically provides Gamow kets with exponential time evolution derived from
the complex poles of the $S$-matrix. It solves the causality problem since it
results in a semigroup evolution. But this semigroup brings into quantum
physics a new concept of the semigroup time $t=0$, a beginning of time. Its
interpretation and observations are discussed in the last section.

important for quantum information applications. Using the generating function
formalism we investigate the theory of a few photons on demand for the square
laser pulse and the rapid adiabatic following method. Exact theory and
numerical solutions are used to design control fields for a two level emitter,
which yield an optimal single or two photon source, under the constrains of
finite laser field strength and finite interaction time. Comparison to
experiments of Brunel et al, shows that the experiments were made close to
optimal conditions.
