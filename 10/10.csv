can systematic errors due to anisotropy in the point spread function (PSF) be
corrected? The largest source of error in this correction to date has been the
interpolation of the PSF to the locations of the galaxies. To address this
error, we separate the PSF patterns into components that recur in multiple
exposures/pointings and those that vary randomly between different exposures
(such as those due to the atmosphere). In an earlier study we developed a
principal component approach to correct the recurring PSF patterns (Jarvis and
Jain 2004). In this paper we show how randomly varying PSF patterns can also be
circumvented in the measurement of shear correlations. For the two-point
correlation function this is done by simply using pairs of galaxy shapes
measured in different exposures. Combining the two techniques allows us to
tackle generic combinations of PSF anisotropy patterns. The second goal of this
paper is to give a formalism for quantifying residual systematic errors due to
PSF patterns. We show how the main PSF corrections improve with increasing
survey area (and thus can stay below the reduced statistical errors), and we
identify the residual errors which do not scale with survey area. Our formalism
can be applied both to planned lensing surveys to optimize instrumental and
survey parameters and to actual lensing data to quantify residual errors.

the metallicity distribution functions are dominated by metal-rich populations,
with a tail extending toward the metal poor end. To first order, the overall
shapes of the metallicity distribution functions are similar to what is
predicted by simple, single-component model of chemical evolution with the
effective yields increasing with galaxy luminosity. However, metallicity
distributions significantly narrower than the simple model are observed for a
few of the most luminous galaxies in the sample. It appears clear that more
luminous spiral galaxies also have more metal-rich stellar halos. The
increasingly significant departures from the closed-box model for the more
luminous galaxies indicate that a parameter in addition to a single yield is
required to describe chemical evolution. This parameter, which could be related
to gas infall or outflow either in situ or in progenitor dwarf galaxies that
later merge to form the stellar halo, tends to act to make the metallicity
distributions narrower at high metallicity.

radioactive decay of unstable elements produced in the explosion. It is
therefore interesting to explore whether short duration events also have ejecta
powered by radioactivity (i.e. that are supernova-like). Observations already
inform us that any supernova like component in the first few well studied short

radiative transfer (RT) through the filamentary IGM. In this study we
investigate, via numerical simulations, the role of RT effects such as
shadowing, self-shielding and filtering of the ionizing radiation, in giving
raise to a fluctuating UVB. We focus on possible detectable signatures of these
effects on quantities derived from Lya forest spectra, as photoionization rate
fluctuations, eta parameter (the HeII to HI column density ratio) distributions
and the IGM temperature at redshift about 3. We find that RT induces
fluctuations up to 60% in the UVB, which are tightly correlated to the density
field. The UVB mean intensity is progressively suppressed toward higher
densities and photon energies above 4 Ryd, due to the high HeII opacity.
Shielding of overdense regions (Delta > 5) from cosmic HeII ionizing radiation,
produces a decreaseing trend of eta with overdensity. Furthermore we find that
the mean eta value inferred from HI-HeII Lya forest observations can be
explained only by properly accounting for the actual IGM opacity. We outline

calibrated polarization data for 25 pulsars, 20 of which display linearly
polarized emission from the pulse longitude at closest approach to the magnetic

polarisation which in turn reflects the position angle of the rotation axis. Of
these 20 pulsars, 10 show an offset between the velocity vector and the
polarisation position angle which is either less than 10\degr or more than
80\degr, a fraction which is very unlikely by random chance. We believe that
the bimodal nature of the distribution arises from the presence of orthogonal
polarisation modes in the pulsar radio emission. In some cases this orthogonal
ambiguity is resolved by observations at other wavelengths so that we conclude
that the velocity vector and the rotation axis are aligned at birth.

the basis of the slope of their nuclear brightness profiles. Here we focus on
the 29 core galaxies (hereafter CoreG). We used HST and Chandra data to isolate
their nuclear emission. The CoreG invariably host radio-loud nuclei, with an
average radio-loudness parameter of Log R = 3.6. The optical and X-ray nuclear
luminosities correlate with the radio-core power, smoothly extending the
analogous correlations already found for low luminosity radio-galaxies. This
supports the interpretation of a common non-thermal origin of the nuclear
emission also for CoreG. The luminosities of the nuclear sources, most likely
dominated by jet emission, set firm upper limits, as low as L/L_Edd = 10^{-9}
in both the optical and X-ray band, on any emission from the accretion process.

associated with (relatively) high activity levels, with CoreG forming the bulk
of the population. A minimum black hole mass of M_{BH} = 10^8 M_sun is

linestrengths from the ENACS spectra for the galaxies of different

average color gets bluer towards later Hubble type. In each morphological class
the faint galaxies are bluer and less metal-rich than the bright ones. This
extends the well-established color-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies to
(late) spirals. Bright early spirals may, on average, have somewhat stronger
H-delta absorption than the other galaxies, which could be due to recent
starformation. The galaxies with emission lines (ELG) have a bluer spectral

the continuum, or vice-versa) we find microlensing events which enhance the Fe
K$\alpha$ line without noticeable amplification of the X-ray continuum, but
only during a limited time interval. Continuum amplification is expected if a
complete microlensing event is monitored. Second, we studied a more realistic
case of amplification by caustic magnification pattern. In this case we could
satisfactorily explain the observations if the Fe K$\alpha$ line is emitted
from the innermost part of the accretion disk, while the continuum is emitted
from a larger region. Also, we studied the chromatic effects of microlensing,
finding that the radial distribution of temperature in the accretion disk,
combined with microlensing itself, can induce wavelength dependent variability
of $\sim$ 30% for microlenses with very small masses. All these results show
that X-ray monitoring of gravitational lenses is a well suited method for
studying of the innermost structure of AGN accretion disks.

  Monteporzio, June 19-24, 2005","Mem.Soc.Ast.It.77:168-171,2006",,,"astro-ph",,"  Most inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of GC stars are due to
primordial enrichment. The model today most credited is that the winds lost by
high mass Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, evolving during the first
$\simlt$200Myr of the Clusters life, directly form a second generation of stars
with abundance anomalies. The best indirect hint towards this suggestion is the
recognition that some peculiarities in the Horizontal Branch (HB) stars
distribution (blue tails, gaps, anomalous luminosity slope of the flat part of
the HB) can be attributed to the larger helium abundance in the matter,
processed through Hot Bottom Burning, from which these stars are born. The
model has been reinforced by finding a peculiar main sequence distribution in
the cluster NGC 2808, which also has a bimodal HB distribution and an extended
blue tail: the excess of blue objects on the main sequence has been interpreted
as stars with very high helium. We remark that the RR Lyr distribution may be
affected by the helium spread, and this can be at the basis of the very long
periods of the RRab variables of the metal rich clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441,
longer than for the very metal poor Oosterhoff II clusters. These periods imply
that the RR Lyr are brighter than expected for their metallicities, consistent
with a larger helium abundance.

have detected the largest population of BSS ever observed in any stellar
system. Even though the sample is restricted to the brightest portion of the
BSS sequence, more than 300 candidates have been identified. BSS are thought to
be produced by the evolution of binary systems (either formed by stellar
collisions or mass exchange in binary stars). Since systems like Galactic
globular clusters (GGC) and omega Cen evolve dynamically on time-scales
significantly shorter than their ages, binaries should have settled toward the
center, showing a more concentrated radial distribution than the ordinary, less
massive single stars. Indeed, in all GGCs which have been surveyed for BSS, the
BSS distribution is peaked at the center. Conversely, in omega Cen we find that
the BSS share the same radial distribution as the adopted reference
populations. This is the cleanest evidence ever found that such a stellar
system is not fully relaxed even in the central region. We further argue that
the absence of central concentration in the BSS distribution rules out a
collisional origin. Thus, the omega Cen BSS are the purest and largest
population of non-collisional BSS ever observed. Our results allow the first
empirical quantitative estimate of the production rate of BSS via this channel.
BSS in omega Cen may represent the best local template for modeling the BSS
populations in distant galaxies where they cannot be individually observed.

distributions we must distinguish: 1. brightest ellipticals (with M < -22), 2.
late spirals, and 3. the ensemble of less bright ellipticals, S0 galaxies and
early spirals. The latter have indistinguishable distributions of projected
radial distance R. The brightest ellipticals are most centrally concentrated,
the late spirals are almost absent from the central regions and the other
classes are intermediate. Radial segregation of the ellipticals is due to the
brightest ellipticals only, that of the spirals to the late spirals only. We
derive the MD-relation with two measures of projected density: one using the 10
nearest neighbours (Sigma10) and another using only the nearest neighbour
(Sigma1). The Sigma10 MD-relation only shows a significant difference between
early- and late-type galaxies, but the different galaxy types within those
classes are indistinguishable. However, The Sigma1 MD-relation shows that the
normal 'ellipticals' (with M >= -22), the S0 galaxies and the early spirals
have different Sigma1-distributions. The reason for this is that Sigma1 is much
less correlated with R than is Sigma10, and thus has much less cross-talk from
the (MR-) relation. On average, the 'normal' ellipticals populate environments
with higher projected density than do the S0 galaxies while the early spirals
populate even less dense environments. The segregation of the brightest
ellipticals and the late spirals is driven mostly by global factors, while the
segregation between 'normal' ellipticals, S0 galaxies and early spirals is
driven primarily by local factors.

3-4 micron spectra. Our main results are: 1. When a spectral indicator
suggesting the presence of an AGN (low equivalent width of the 3.3 micron
emission line, steep lambda-f_lambda spectrum, presence of an absorption
feature at 3.4 micron) is found, the AGN is always confirmed by independent
analysis at other wavelengths. Conversely, in all known AGNs at least one of
the above indicators is present. 2. Two new diagnostic diagrams are proposed
combining the above indicators, in which starbursts and AGNs are clearly and
completely separated. 3. The above diagnostic techniques are possible with
spectra of relatively low quality, which can be obtained for several tens of
ULIRGs with currently available telescopes. This makes L-band spectroscopy the
current best tool to disentangle AGNs and starbursts contributions in ULIRGs.
4. The L-band properties of ULIRGs are heterogeneous. However, we show that all
the spectral differences among ULIRGs can be reproduced starting from pure
intrinsic AGN and SB spectra and varying two parameters: the amount of dust
extinction of the AGN component, and the relative AGN/SB contribution to the
bolometric luminosity. 5. Using the above decomposition model, we show that
AGNs in ULIRGs have a low dust-to-gas ratio and a dust extinction curve
different from Galactic. 6. The estimate of the contribution of AGNs in a
complete sample show that AGNs are hosted by ~2/3 of ULIRGs, but their
energetic contribution is relevant only in ~20% of the sample.

strong pair-breaking effect. The superconducting transition temperature, T_c,
in Mg_{1-x}Mn_xB_2 has been found to be rapidly suppressed at an initial rate
of 10 K/%Mn, leading to a complete suppression of superconductivity at about 2%
Mn substitution. This reflects the strong coupling between the conduction
electrons and the 3d local moments, predominantly of magnetic character, since
the nonmagnetic ion substitutions, e.g. with Al or C, suppress T_c much less
effectively (e.g. 0.5 K/%Al). The magnitude of the magnetic moment, derived
from normal state susceptibility measurements, uniquely identifies the Mn ions
to be divalent, and to be in the low-spin state (S = 1/2). This has been found
also in X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. Isovalent Mn^{2+}
substitution for Mg^{2+} mainly affects superconductivity through spin-flip
scattering reducing T_c rapidly and lowering the upper critical field
anisotropy H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^c at T = 0 from 6 to 3.3 (x = 0.88% Mn), while
leaving the initial slope dH_{c2}/dT near T_c unchanged for both field

description of the system, we derive a master equation for the SET island
charge and resonator which is valid in the limit of weak electro-mechanical
coupling. Using this master equation we show that, apart from brief transients,
the resonator always behaves like a damped harmonic oscillator with a shifted
frequency and relaxes into a thermal-like steady state. Although the behaviour
remains qualitatively the same, we find that the magnitude of the resonator
damping rate and frequency shift depend very sensitively on the relative
magnitudes of the resonator period and the electron tunnelling time. Maximum
damping occurs when the electrical and mechanical time-scales are the same, but
the frequency shift is greatest when the resonator moves much more slowly than
the island charge. We then derive reduced master equations which describe just
the resonator dynamics. By making slightly different approximations, we obtain
two different reduced master equations for the resonator. Apart from minor
differences, the two reduced master equations give rise to a consistent picture
of the resonator dynamics which matches that obtained from the master equation
including the SET island charge.

The effective critical character of the \textit{N}-Sm\textit{A} transition
remains unchanged over the entire range of introduced quenched random disorder
while the peak height and enthalpy can be well described by considering a
cut-off length scale to the quasi-critical fluctuations. The robust nature of

cyanobiphenyl-aerosil systems and may be due to the mesogens being non-polar

collapse to a black hole leads to quantum amplitudes (not just probabilities)

spatial infinity. Following Feynman's $+i\epsilon$ approach, we rotate: $T\to
{\mid}T{\mid} \exp(-i\theta)$, for $0<\theta\leq\pi/2$. The {\it classical}
complexified boundary-value problem is expected to be well-posed for
$0<\theta\leq\pi/2$, with classical action $S_{\rm class}$. For a locally
supersymmetric Lagrangian, containing supergravity, possibly coupled to
supermatter, the resulting quantum amplitude will be proportional to
$\exp(iS_{\rm class})$, apart from possible loop corrections which are
negligible for boundary data with frequencies below the Planck scale. The
Lorentzian quantum amplitude is recovered by taking the limit as $\theta\to
0_+$ of this amplitude. In the present paper, a connection is made between this
boundary value approach and the original approach to quantum evaporation in
gravitational collapse to a black hole, {\it via} Bogoliubov coefficients. This
connection is developed through consideration of the radial equation obeyed by
the (adiabatic) non-spherical classical perturbations. When one studies the
resulting final probability distribution, based on our quantum amplitudes
above, one finds that this distribution can also be interpreted in terms of the
Wigner quasi-probability distribution for harmonic oscillators.

mission consists of three spacecraft in separate solar orbits and carries out
laser interferometric ranging. ASTROD aims at testing relativistic gravity,
measuring the solar system and detecting gravitational waves. Because of the
larger arm length, the sensitivity of ASTROD to gravitational waves is
estimated to be about 30 times better than Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) in the frequency range lower than about 0.1 mHz. ASTROD I is a simple
version of ASTROD, employing one spacecraft in a solar orbit. It is the first
step for ASTROD and serves as a technology demonstration mission for ASTROD. In
addition, several scientific results are expected in the ASTROD I experiment.
The required acceleration noise level of ASTROD I is 10^-13 m s^-2 Hz^{-1/2} at
the frequency of 0.1 mHz. In this paper, we focus on local gravity gradient
noise that could be one of the largest acceleration disturbances in the ASTROD
I experiment. We have carried out gravitational modelling for the current
test-mass design and simplified configurations of ASTROD I by using an
analytical method and the Monte Carlo method. Our analyses can be applied to
figure out the optimal designs of the test mass and the constructing materials
of the spacecraft, and the configuration of compensation mass to reduce local

generic supersymmetric backgrounds. It amounts to adding quadratic and linear

rates. Using two methods of synchronization, a bright optical pulse scheme and
an electrical signal scheme, we have successfully distributed key material at
1,550 nm over 50 km of optical fiber. We discuss how use of these detectors in
a quantum key distribution system can result in dramatic increases in range and
performance.
