  changes made to match published version","Phys.Rev.D73:104005,2006","10.1103/PhysRevD.73.104005",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  Numerical simulations of binary neutron stars by Wilson, Mathews, and
Marronetti indicated that neutron stars that are stable in isolation can be
made to collapse to black holes when placed in a binary. This claim was
surprising as it ran counter to the Newtonian expectation that a neutron star
in a binary should be more stable, not less. After correcting an error found by
Flanagan, Wilson and Mathews found that the compression of the neutron stars
was significantly reduced but not eliminated. This has motivated us to ask the
following general question: Under what circumstances can general-relativistic
tidal interactions cause an otherwise stable neutron star to be compressed? We
have found that if a nonrotating neutron star possesses a current-quadrupole
moment, interactions with a gravitomagnetic tidal field can lead to a
compressive force on the star. If this current quadrupole is induced by the
gravitomagnetic tidal field, it is related to the tidal field by an
equation-of-state-dependent constant called the gravitomagnetic Love number.
This is analogous to the Newtonian Love number that relates the strength of a
Newtonian tidal field to the induced mass quadrupole moment of a star. The
compressive force is almost never larger than the Newtonian tidal interaction
that stabilizes the neutron star against collapse. In the case in which a
current quadrupole is already present in the star (perhaps as an artifact of a
numerical simulation), the compressive force can exceed the stabilizing one,
leading to a net increase in the central density of the star. This increase is
small (<~1%) but could, in principle, cause gravitational collapse in a star
that is close to its maximum mass.

the parametric resonance) give an accurate estimate of the spin for the three

the Galaxy centre seems also to be consistent with the 3:2 ratio established by
previous observations in microquasars, however the Sgr A* data are rather
difficult for the same exact analysis. If confirmed, the 3:2 ratio of double

great flexibility in representing and modeling complex phenomena, while
variational-PDE methods gain enormous computational advantages over Monte-Carlo
or other stochastic algorithms. In combination, the two can lead to much more
powerful novel models and efficient algorithms. In the current work, we propose
a stochastic-variational model for soft (or fuzzy) Mumford-Shah segmentation of
mixture image patterns. Unlike the classical hard Mumford-Shah segmentation,
the new model allows each pixel to belong to each image pattern with some
probability. We show that soft segmentation leads to hard segmentation, and
hence is more general. The modeling procedure, mathematical analysis, and
computational implementation of the new model are explored in detail, and
numerical examples of synthetic and natural images are presented.

the simple Poisson process the role played by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
for Brownian Motion. Some of the inequalities are recovered by semi-group
interpolation. Additionally, we explore the behaviour of these entropic
inequalities under a particular scaling, which sees the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process as a fluid limit of M/M/$\infty$ queues. Proofs are elementary and rely

displacement and virtual work, is discussed in this article. A definition of
virtual displacement is presented that allows one to express them explicitly
for holonomic (velocity independent), non-holonomic (velocity dependent),
scleronomous (time independent) and rheonomous (time dependent) constraints. It
is observed that for holonomic, scleronomous constraints, the virtual
displacements are the displacements allowed by the constraints. However, this
is not so for a general class of constraints. For simple physical systems, it
is shown that, the work done by the constraint forces on virtual displacements
is zero. This motivates Lagrange's extension of d'Alembert's principle to
system of particles in constrained motion. However a similar zero work
principle does not hold for the allowed displacements. It is also demonstrated
that d'Alembert's principle of zero virtual work is necessary for the
solvability of a constrained mechanical problem. We identify this special class
of constraints, physically realized and solvable, as {\it the ideal
constraints}. The concept of virtual displacement and the principle of zero
virtual work by constraint forces are central to both Lagrange's method of
undetermined multipliers, and Lagrange's equations in generalized coordinates.

  Associated with Adjacency Matrix","38 pages, 3 figures, regular paper",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Using the spectral distribution associated with the adjacency matrix of
graphs, we introduce a new method of calculation of amplitudes of
continuous-time quantum walk on some rather important graphs, such as line,
cycle graph $C_n$, complete graph $K_n$, graph $G_n$, finite path and some
other finite and infinite graphs, where all are connected with orthogonal
polynomials such as Hermite, Laguerre, Tchebichef and some other orthogonal
polynomials. It is shown that using the spectral distribution, one can obtain
the infinite time asymptotic behavior of amplitudes simply by using the method
of stationary phase approximation(WKB approximation), where as an example, the
method is applied to star, two-dimensional comb lattices, infinite Hermite and
Laguerre graphs. Also by using the Gauss quadrature formula one can approximate
infinite graphs with finite ones and vice versa, in order to derive large time
asymptotic behavior by WKB method. Likewise, using this method, some new graphs
are introduced, where their amplitude are proportional to product of amplitudes
of some elementary graphs, even though the graphs themselves are not the same
as Cartesian product of their elementary graphs. Finally, via calculating mean
end to end distance of some infinite graphs at large enough times, it is shown
that continuous time quantum walk at different infinite graphs belong to
different universality classes which are also different than those of the
corresponding classical ones.
