are complicated by a host of strong foreground sources. Several foreground
removal techniques have been proposed in the literature, and it has been
assumed that these would be used in combination to reveal the Epoch of
Reionization (EOR) signal. By studying the characteristic subtraction errors of
the proposed foreground removal techniques, we identify an additional
subtraction stage that can further reduce the EOR foreground contamination, and
study the interactions between the foreground removal algorithms. This enables
us to outline a comprehensive foreground removal strategy that incorporates all
previously proposed subtraction techniques. Using this foreground removal
framework and the characteristic subtraction errors, we discuss the
complementarity of different foreground removal techniques and the implications
for array design and the analysis of EOR data.

I doublet absorption lines, and 2) those with broad 2.058 micron He I emission
lines. These data have the highest spectral resolution ever obtained for these

measure radial velocities. The majority of the measured radial velocities have
relative errors of 20 kms, smaller than those previously obtained with
proper-motion or radial velocity measurements for similar stellar samples in
the Galactic center. The radial velocities estimated from the He I absorption
doublet are more robust than those previously estimated from the 2.058 micron
emission line, since they do not suffer from confusion due to emission from the
surrounding ISM. Using this velocity information, we agree that the stars are
orbiting in a somewhat coherent manner but are not as defined into a disk or
disks as previously thought. Finally, multi-epoch radial velocity measurements
for IRS 16NE show a change in its velocity presumably due to an unseen stellar

comes from two elongated structures (indicated as Group I and Group II), with
the measured proper motions aligned along the structures' elongation axes. Each
group consists of two (blue- and red-shifted) clusters of features separated by
a few hundreds and thousands of AU respectively for Group I and Group II. The
maser features of Group II have both positions and velocities aligned along a
direction close to the axis of the outflow traced by HCO+ and SiO emission on
angular scales of tens of arcsec. We predict that the maser emission arises
from dense, shocked molecular clumps displaced along the axis of the molecular
outflow. The two maser clusters of Group I are oriented on the sky along a
direction forming a large angle (> 60 degrees) with the axis of the jet/outflow
traced by Group II maser features. We have detected a compact (8.4 and 22 GHz)
continuum source that falls close to the centroid of Group I masers, indicating
that the source ionizing the gas is also responsible for the excitation of the
water masers. The kinematic analysis indicates that the Group I masers trace
outflowing rather than rotating gas, discarding the Keplerian disk scenario
proposed in a previous paper for Group I. Since the axis joining the two maser
clusters of Group II does not cross the position of the continuum source, Group
II masers might be excited by an (undetected) massive YSO, distinct from the
one (pinpointed by the VLA continuum emission) responsible for the excitation
of the Group I masers.

V382 Vel (1999), obtained with the LETG+HRC-S instrument on board CHANDRA,
which shows emission lines dominating over any continuum. Lines of Si, Mg, Ne,
O, N, and C are identified, but no Fe lines are detected. The total luminosity
in the lines is 4x10^27erg/s (corrected for N_H=1.2x10^21cm^-2). The lines have
broad profiles with FWHM corresponding to a velocity 2900+-200km/s. Some
structure is identified in the profiles, but for different elements we find
different profile structures. While lines of O show a broadened Gaussian
profile, those of Ne are double-peaked, suggesting a fragmented emitting
plasma. Using the emission measure distribution we derive relative element
abundances and find abundances of Ne and N that are significantly enhanced
relative to that of O, while Fe is not over-abundant. The lack of any source
emission longwards of 50A and the OVIII Ly_alpha/Ly_beta line ratio support
previous values of the hydrogen column-density. We find weak continuum emission
from the white dwarf, consistent with a black-body spectrum with an upper limit
to the temperature of T=3x10^5K, assuming a source radius of 6000km. The upper
limit for the integrated black-body luminosity is 2x10^36erg/s. The BeppoSAX
and Chandra ACIS observations of V382 Vel show that the nova was bright and in
the Super Soft phase as late as 1999 December 30. Our LETG observation obtained
6 weeks later, as well as all subsequent X-ray observations, showed a
remarkable fading to a nearly pure emission line phase which suggests that

spectral variability is examined with a model independent hardness ratio
method. We find that the spectral evolution of the source follows the light
curves well, indicating that the spectra harden when the fluxes increase. The
plots of hardness ratios versus count rates show that the spectral changes are
particularly significant during flares. The cross-correlation functions (CCFs)
show that the light curves in the different energy bands are well correlated at
different time lags. The CCF peaks (i.e., the maximum correlation coefficients)
tend to become smaller with larger energy differences, and the variability in
the different energy bands are more correlated for the flares than for the
other cases. In most cases the higher energy band variations lead the lower
energy band, but in two cases we observed the opposite behavior that the lower
energy variability possibly leads the higher energy variability. The time lags
increase with the energy differences between the two cross-correlated light
curves. The maximum lag is found to be up to about one hour, in support with
the findings obtained with previous low Earth orbit X-ray missions. We discuss
our results in the context of the particle acceleration, cooling and light

important testbeds for non-LTE model atoms for helium. Improved non-LTE
computations show that analyses assuming LTE or based on older non-LTE model

significant because archival optical spectral data indicates that the accretion
disk has a thermal luminosity, $L_{bol}>2\times 10^{47}\mathrm{ergs/s}$.
Furthermore, estimates of the central black hole mass from line widths indicate
that $L_{bol}/L_{Edd}\approx 1$. This suggests that neither a large $L_{bol}$
nor $L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$ suppresses jet power in quasars, despite claims that they
do in the recent literature. Earlier studies have found $L_{bol}$ and $Q$ are
correlated in blazars. However, by removing the BL-Lacs and leaving only the
quasars in the sample, we found that $Q$ is very weakly correlated with
$L_{bol}$ in the subsample.

X-ray measurements, an interesting scenario emerges where the X-ray light
emission may be produced by a two-phase (clumpy/smooth) circumstellar medium.
The X-ray spectral analysis shows statistically significant evidence for the
presence of two distinct components, that can be modeled with emission from
optically thin, thermal plasmas at different temperatures. The exponent of the
ejecta density distribution inferred from these temperatures is $n\simeq 6.4$.

super-giants. Coordinated optical and infrared observations allow us to
reconstruct the simultaneous infrared to X-ray flux distribution of SN 1995N.

along the a-axis, resulting in modulated crystal structure due to the
inter-subcell interaction. The structural modulation affects carrier conduction
through the potential randomness. We found that the two-dimensional (2-D)
variable-range hopping (VRH) regime with hole conduction is dominant at low
temperature for this compound, and that the conduction mechanism undergoes
crossover from the 2-D VRH regime to thermal activation-energy type one with
increasing temperature. Based on the experimental results of resistivity,
thermoelectric power, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements,
we suggested a possible electronic-band structure model to explain these
results. The cobalt t2g-derivative band crosses Fermi energy level near the
band edge, yielding small finite density of localized states at the Fermi level
in the band. The observed resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, large Pauli
paramagnetic component in the magnetic susceptibility and comparatively small
Sommerfeld constant in the specific heat are principally attributed to the

environmental monitoring. When comparing measured data to data drawn from a
baseline distribution, merely, finding clusters in the measured data may not
actually represent true anomalies. These clusters may likely be the clusters of
the baseline distribution. Hence, a discrepancy function is often used to
examine how different measured data is to baseline data within a region. An
anomalous region is thus defined to be one with high discrepancy.
  In this paper, we present algorithms for maximizing statistical discrepancy
functions over the space of axis-parallel rectangles. We give provable
approximation guarantees, both additive and relative, and our methods apply to
any convex discrepancy function. Our algorithms work by connecting statistical
discrepancy to combinatorial discrepancy; roughly speaking, we show that in
order to maximize a convex discrepancy function over a class of shapes, one
needs only maximize a linear discrepancy function over the same set of shapes.
  We derive general discrepancy functions for data generated from a one-
parameter exponential family. This generalizes the widely-used Kulldorff scan
statistic for data from a Poisson distribution. We present an algorithm running
in $O(\smash[tb]{\frac{1}{\epsilon} n^2 \log^2 n})$ that computes the maximum
discrepancy rectangle to within additive error $\epsilon$, for the Kulldorff
scan statistic. Similar results hold for relative error and for discrepancy
functions for data coming from Gaussian, Bernoulli, and gamma distributions.
Prior to our work, the best known algorithms were exact and ran in time

various time scales. A well studied issue is the estimation of statistical
parameters characterizing traffic self-similarity and LRD, such as the Hurst
parameter H. In this paper, we propose to adapt the Modified Allan Variance
(MAVAR), a time-domain quantity originally conceived to discriminate fractional
noise in frequency stability measurement, to estimate the Hurst parameter of
LRD traffic traces and, more generally, to identify fractional noise components
in network traffic. This novel method is validated by comparison to one of the
best techniques for analyzing self-similar and LRD traffic: the logscale
diagram based on wavelet analysis. Both methods are applied to pseudo-random
LRD data series, generated with assigned values of H. The superior spectral
sensitivity of MAVAR achieves outstanding accuracy in estimating H, even better
than the logscale method. The behaviour of MAVAR with most common deterministic
signals that yield nonstationarity in data under analysis is also studied.
Finally, both techniques are applied to a real IP traffic trace, providing a
sound example of the usefulness of MAVAR also in traffic characterization, to
complement other established techniques as the logscale method.

the merging of spanning trees from the different sources to a set of

Accordingly, determination of Internet topology characteristics from such
sampled maps is in part a problem of statistical inference. Our contribution
begins with the observation that the inference of many of the most basic
topological quantities -- including network size and degree characteristics --
from traceroute measurements is in fact a version of the so-called `species
problem' in statistics. This observation has important implications, since
species problems are often quite challenging. We focus here on the most
fundamental example of a traceroute internet species: the number of nodes in a
network. Specifically, we characterize the difficulty of estimating this
quantity through a set of analytical arguments, we use statistical subsampling
principles to derive two proposed estimators, and we illustrate the performance
of these estimators on networks with various topological characteristics.

performed from the most general perspective of considering all possible choices
for the gauge symmetry group. In this context, an interesting role is played by
G(2) Yang-Mills theory: the simplest pure gauge theory with a trivial center
and without 't Hooft flux vortices. Numerical simulations show the presence of
a first order finite temperature deconfinement phase transition in G(2)
Yang-Mills theory in (3+1) dimensions. Interestingly, the G(2) gauge symmetry
can be broken to an SU(3) subgroup by the Higgs mechanism. We investigate the
relation between the deconfinement phase transition in G(2) and SU(3)
Yang-Mills theories by numerical simulations in the G(2) gauge-Higgs system.

coupled to gravity to the massive case. In particular, we derive a worldline
path integral representation for the one-loop effective action of a massive
antisymmetric tensor field of rank p (a massive p-form) whose dynamics is
dictated by a standard Proca-like lagrangian coupled to a background metric.
This effective action can be computed in a proper time expansion to obtain the
corresponding Seeley-DeWitt coefficients a0, a1, a2. The worldline approach
immediately shows that these coefficients are derived from the massless ones by
the simple shift D -> D+1, where D is the spacetime dimension. Also, the
worldline representation makes it simple to derive exact duality relations.
Finally, we use such a representation to calculate the one-loop contribution to
the graviton self-energy due to both massless and massive antisymmetric tensor
fields of arbitrary rank, generalizing results already known for the massless
spin 1 field (the photon).

GUTs in five dimensions from the heterotic string. I focus on one particular
model with E(6) gauge symmetry in 5D, the third family and Higgs doublet coming
from the 5D bulk and the first two families living on 4D SO(10) branes. Note
the E(6) gauge symmetry is broken to Pati-Salam in 4D which subsequently breaks
to the Standard Model gauge symmetry via the Higgs mechanism. The model has two
flaws, one fatal and one perhaps only unaesthetic. The model has a small set of
vector-like exotics with fractional electromagnetic charge. Unfortunately not
all of these states obtain mass at the compactification scale. This flaw is
fatal. The second problem is R parity violating interactions. These problems
may be avoidable in alternate orbifold compactification schemes. It is these
problems which we discuss in this talk.

general approaches exist to investigate it.
  In Landau theory, the state of a system is described by a finite dimensional
variable (the {\it order parameter}), and physical states correspond to minima
of a potential, invariant under a group.
  In this article we describe the basics of symmetry breaking analysis for
systems described by a symmetric polynomial; in particular we discuss generic
symmetry breakings, i.e. those determined by the symmetry properties themselves
and independent on the details of the polynomial describing a concrete system.
We also discuss how the plethora of invariant polynomials can be to some extent

certain types of polynomials with no loss of generality. Finally, we will give
some indications on extension of this theory, i.e. on how one deals with

compute unbiased estimators for non canonical branching
  Markov processes, which occur, for instance, in the modeling of the
polymerase chain reaction. By convexity, the ratio of the harmonic mean to the
mean is at most 1. We prove that, for every square integrable branching
mechanisms, this ratio lies between 1-A/k and 1-B/k for every initial
population of size k greater than A. The positive constants A and B, such that
B is at most A, are explicit and depend only on the generation-by-generation
branching mechanisms. In particular, we do not use the distribution of the
limit of the classical martingale associated to the Galton-Watson process.
Thus, emphasis is put on non asymptotic bounds and on the dependence of the
harmonic mean upon the size of the initial population. In the Bernoulli case,
which is relevant for the modeling of the polymerase chain reaction, we prove
essentially optimal bounds that are valid for every initial population.
Finally, in the general case and for large enough initial populations, similar

carries a charge, $\omega_n$, that determines the type (attractive or

there is a polymer--interface interaction and we want to model the case in
which there are impurities $\tilde\omega_n$, that we call again charges, at the
interface. The charges are distributed in an in--homogeneous fashion along the
chain and at the interface: more precisely the model we consider is of quenched
disordered type.
  It is well known that such a model undergoes a localization/delocalization
transition. We focus on the localized phase, where the polymer sticks to the
interface. Our new results include estimates on the exponential decay of
averaged correlations and the proof that the free energy is infinitely
differentiable away from the transition. Other results we prove, instead,
generalize earlier works that typically deal either with the case of copolymers
near an homogeneous interface ($\tilde\omega\equiv 0$) or with the case of

lower branch reflects the coupling to two resonance-hole states that are almost
degenerate. For the $D^-$ we obtain a single mode pushed up by about 18 MeV

Eulerian description shows that it evokes Minkowski metric for any flow field
domain without any previous postulation. Mathematical approach is developed
within the framework of congruences for general 4-dimensional differentiable
manifold and the final result is formulated in form of a theorem. A modified

transverse components as Maxwell's theory predicted. Moreover, as we now know
from recently published Hertz's dairy and private notes, his first experimental
results indicated clearly on infinite rate of propagation. Nevertheless,
Hertz's experiments provided no further explicit information on non-local
longitudinal components which were such an essential feature of Helmholtz's
theory. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a decisive choice on the
adequate account of electromagnetic interactions are discussed from the
position of modern scientific method.

addressed this problem using a depletion controlled cell adhesion and measured
the force necessary to separate the cells with a micropipette technique. We

sufficiently elastic and has a sufficiently low deformability for JKR theory to

qualitatively as the relative weight of the loops increases, from the phase
