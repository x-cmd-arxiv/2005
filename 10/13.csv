corrected for the Bianchi component. This is due to the reduction of the cold
spot at Galactic coordinates (l,b)=(209^\circ,-57\circ), which Cruz et al.

Our previous detections of non-Gaussianity observed in the skewness of
spherical wavelet coefficients are not reduced by the Bianchi correction.
Indeed, the most significant detection of non-Gaussianity made with the
spherical real Morlet wavelet at a significant level of 98.4% remains (using a

very compact HII regions that emit optically thick radiation at radio

importance of this input for any large-scale model of the final explosion.
Here, we begin a process of understanding the ignition of these hotspots by
examining the burning of one zone of material, and then investigate the
ignition of a detonation due to rapid heating at single point.
  We numerically measure the ignition delay time for onset of burning in
mixtures of degenerate material and provide fitting formula for conditions of
relevance in the Type Ia problem. Using the neon abundance as a proxy for the
white dwarf metallicity, we then find that ignition times can decrease by ~20%
with addition of even 5% of neon by mass. When temperature fluctuations that
successfully kindle a region are very rare, such a reduction in ignition time
can increase the probability of ignition by orders of magnitude. If the neon
comes largely at the expense of carbon, a similar increase in the ignition time
can occur.
  We then consider the ignition of a detonation by an explosive energy input in
one localized zone, eg a Sedov blast wave leading to a shock-ignited
detonation. Building on previous work on curved detonations, we find that
surprisingly large inputs of energy are required to successfully launch a
detonation, leading to required matchheads of ~4500 detonation thicknesses -
tens of centimeters to hundreds of meters - which is orders of magnitude larger
than naive considerations might suggest. This is a very difficult constraint to
meet for some pictures of a deflagration-to-detonation transition, such as a
Zel'dovich gradient mechanism ignition in the distributed burning regime.

ever observed in a DLA, and is about five times larger than the strongest DLA
detected so far in any QSO spectrum. From the optical spectrum, we also find a
very large Zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of
[Zn/H]=-1.0+/-0.4. These large columns are supported by the X-ray spectrum from
Swift-XRT which shows a column density (in excess of Galactic) of
log(nH)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). The
comparison of this X-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption due
to alpha-chain elements, and the HI column density derived from the Ly-alpha
absorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of
[alpha/H]=-0.4+/-0.3. The optical spectrum is reddened and can be well
reproduced with a power-law with SMC extinction, where A_V=0.62+/-0.06. But the
total optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independent
of the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-X-ray spectral energy
distribution we find, 0.5<~A_V<~4.5. However, even this upper limit,
independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dust
column that is inferred from the X-ray column density, i.e.
A_V=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. This discrepancy might be explained by a small dust
content with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `Grey' extinction
cannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to a
measurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).
Little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grains
or may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred Myr.

hole mass growth, both of the integrated mass density and the masses of most

high accretion rate stage, and not by the radiatively inefficient low accretion
rate phase in which most local supermassive black holes are currently observed.
This conclusion is particularly true of supermassive black holes in elliptical
host galaxies, as expected if they have undergone merger activity in the past
which would fuel quasar activity and rapid growth. We discuss models of the
time evolution of accretion rates and show that they all predict significant
mass growth in a prior radiatively efficient state. The only way to avoid this
conclusion is through careful fine-tuning of the accretion/quasar timescale to
a value that is inconsistent with observations. Our results agree with a wide
range of observational inferences drawn from the quasar luminosity function and
X-ray background synthesis models, but our approach has the virtue of being
independent of the modeling of source populations. Models in which black holes
spend the great majority of their time in low accretion rate phases are thus
completely consistent both with observations implying mass gain in relatively
short, high accretion rate phases and with the local distribution of accretion
rates.

redshift z>10. We use hierarchical structure formation simulations to explore
the kinematics and spatial distribution of these early star-forming structures
in galaxy haloes today. Most of the proto-galaxies rapidly merge, their stellar
contents and dark matter becoming smoothly distributed and forming the inner
Galactic halo. The metal-poor globular clusters and old halo stars become
tracers of this early evolutionary phase, centrally biased and naturally
reproducing the observed steep fall off with radius. The most outlying peaks
fall in late and survive to the present day as satellite galaxies. The observed
radial velocity dispersion profile and the local radial velocity anisotropy of
Milky Way halo stars are successfully reproduced in this model. If this epoch
of structure formation coincides with a suppression of further cooling into
lower sigma peaks then we can reproduce the rarity, kinematics and spatial
distribution of satellite galaxies as suggested by Bullock et al. (2000).
Reionisation at z=12+/-2 provides a natural solution to the missing satellites
problem. Measuring the distribution of globular clusters and halo light on
scales from galaxies to clusters could be used to constrain global versus local
reionisation models. If reionisation occurs contemporary, our model predicts a
constant frequency of blue globulars relative to the host halo mass, except for
dwarf galaxies where the average relative frequencies become smaller.

in the current cosmological paradigm by rapid evolution in quasar bias. We show
that quasar biasing must have changed from b_Q~3 at a (photometric) redshift of
z=2.2 to b_Q~1.2-1.3 by z=0.75. Such a rapid increase with redshift in biasing
implies that quasars at z~2 cannot be the progenitors of modern L* objects,
rather they must now reside in dense environments, such as clusters. Similarly,
the duration of the UVX quasar phase must be short enough to explain why local
UVX quasars reside in essentially unbiased structures. Our estimates of b_Q are
in good agreement with recent spectroscopic results, which demonstrate the
implied evolution in b_Q is consistent with quasars inhabiting halos of similar
mass at every redshift. Treating quasar clustering as a function of both
redshift and luminosity, we find no evidence for luminosity dependence in
quasar clustering, and that redshift evolution thus affects quasar clustering
more than changes in quasars' luminosity. We provide a new method for
quantifying stellar contamination in photometrically-classified quasar catalogs
via the correlation function.

excellent agreement with those obtained using numerical simulations. Using a
suite of 55 PINOCCHIO simulations, with 256^3 particles each, we study the MAHs
of 12,924 cold dark matter haloes in a \LambdaCDM concordance cosmology. We
show that haloes less massive than the characteristic non-linear mass scale
establish their potential wells much before they acquire most of their mass.
The time when a halo reaches its maximum virial velocity roughly divides its
mass assembly into two phases, a fast accretion phase which is dominated by
major mergers, and a slow accretion phase dominated by minor mergers. Each halo
experiences about 3 \pm 2 major mergers since its main progenitor had a mass
equal to one percent of the final halo mass. This major merger statistic is
found to be virtually independent of halo mass. However, the average redshift
at which these major mergers occur, is strongly mass dependent, with more
massive haloes experiencing their major mergers later.

  Most important in our review is that we show that the standard scenario for

Bethe and Brown (1998) showed that this fate could be avoided if the two giants
in the progenitor binary burned He at the same time, and that in this way the
binary could avoid the common envelope evolution of the NS with red giant
companion which sends the first born NS into a BH in the standard scenario. The
burning of He at the same time requires, for the more massive giants such as
the progenitors of the Hulse-Taylor binary NS that the two giants be within 4%
of each other in ZAMS mass. Applying this criterion to all binaries results in
a factor 5 of LMBH-NS binaries as compared with NS-NS binaries.

mapping to get the BLR size, the derived M_BH interestingly does not depend on

\Omega_{\Lambda} in the standard flat model. This means, e.g., that enough of
extragalactic objects radiating at the Eddington limit could be used to study
the global Hubble constant in a new way, bypassing the local distance ladder.
The method could become practical when systematic errors in derived M_BH are
understood and objects with L /leq L_Edd can be independently identified. As an
illustration, if we take a sample of tranquil very luminous quasars in the
redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.6, and assume that they are radiating with L_bol

to whether this structure is maintained in the molecular phase or not. Here we
investigate whether the warm neutral atomic hydrogen (WNM) can exist in
molecular clouds. We calculate how far a piece of WNM which is not heated by
the UV photons could penetrate into the cloud, and find that in the absence of
any heating it is unlikely that large fraction of WNM survives inside high
pressure molecular clouds. We then consider two possible heating mechanisms,
namely dissipation of turbulent energy and dissipation of MHD waves propagating
in the WNM inside the cloud. We find that the second one is sufficient to allow
the existence of WNM inside a molecular cloud of size $\simeq$ 1 pc having
pressure equal to $\simeq 10 \times P_{\rm ISM}$. This result suggests the
possibility that channels of magnetised WMN may provide efficient energy
injection for sustaining internal turbulence which otherwise decays in a

short time scale fluctuations are stronger in the radiation hydro models.
  An interesting result of this work lies in the analysis of the temperature
structure around the planet. The most striking effect of treating the
thermodynamics properly is the formation of a hot pressure--supported bubble
around the planet with a pressure scale height of H/R ~ 0.5 rather than a thin
Keplerian circumplanetary accretion disk. We also observe an outflow of gas
above and below the planet during the gap opening phase.

hydrodynamical simulations. The disk is treated as a two-dimensional viscous
fluid and the planet is kept on a fixed orbit. We run a set of simulations
varying the planet mass, and the viscosity and temperature of the disk. All
runs are followed until they reach a quasi-equilibrium state.
  We find that for planetary masses above a certain minimum mass, already 3
M_Jup for a viscosity of nu = 10^{-5}, the disk makes a transition from a
nearly circular state into an eccentric state. Increasing the planetary mass
leads to a saturation of disk eccentricity with a maximum value of around 0.25.
The transition to the eccentric state is driven by the excitation of an m=2
spiral wave at the outer 1:3 Lindblad resonance. The effect occurs only if the
planetary masses are large enough to clear a sufficiently wide and deep gap to
reduce the damping effect of the outer 1:2 Lindblad resonance. An increase in
viscosity and temperature in the disk, which both tend to close the gap, have
an adverse influence on the disk eccentricity.
  In the eccentric state the mass accretion rate onto the planet is greatly
enhanced, an effect that may ease the formation of massive planets beyond about
5 M_Jup that are otherwise difficult to reach.

of about -1.5 kG. If confirmed, this scenario suggests that HD 191612 is,
essentially, an evolved version of the near-ZAMS magnetic O star theta1 Ori C,

the specific heat and correlation lengths of anisotropic type-II
superconductors near the zero field transition temperature Tc. Since near the
zero field transition thermal fluctuations are expected to dominate and with
increasing field strength these fluctuations become one dimensional, whereupon
the effect of fluctuations increases, it appears unavoidable to account for
thermal fluctuations. Invoking the scaling theory of critical phenomena it is
shown that the specific heat data of nearly optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7-x are
inconsistent with the traditional mean-field and lowest Landau level
predictions of a continuous superconductor to normal state transition along an
upper critical field Hc2(T). On the contrary, we observe agreement with a
magnetic field induced finite size effect, whereupon even the correlation
length longitudinal to the applied field H cannot grow beyond the limiting
magnetic length L(H). It arises because with increasing magnetic field the
density of vortex lines becomes greater, but this cannot continue indefinitely.
L(H) is then roughly set on the proximity of vortex lines by the overlapping of
their cores. Thus, the shift and the rounding of the specific heat peak in an
applied field is traced back to a magnetic field induced finite size effect in
the correlation length longitudinal to the applied field.

due to the existence of the Aharonov-Bohm cages at f=1/2, we find evidence for
the existence of an intermediate insulating phase characterized by a zero

bosons are localized due to the external frustration and the topology of the

of finding the minimum L0 norm representation for y is a hard problem. The
Basis Pursuit (BP) approach proposes to find the minimum L1 norm representation
instead, which corresponds to a linear program (LP) that can be solved using
modern LP techniques, and several recent authors have given conditions for the
BP (minimum L1 norm) and sparse (minimum L0 solutions) representations to be
identical. In this paper, we explore this sparse representation problem} using
the geometry of convex polytopes, as recently introduced into the field by
Donoho. By considering the dual LP we find that the so-called polar polytope P
of the centrally-symmetric polytope P whose vertices are the atom pairs +-a_i
is particularly helpful in providing us with geometrical insight into
optimality conditions given by Fuchs and Tropp for non-unit-norm atom sets. In
exploring this geometry we are able to tighten some of these earlier results,
showing for example that the Fuchs condition is both necessary and sufficient
for L1-unique-optimality, and that there are situations where Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) can eventually find all L1-unique-optimal solutions with
m nonzeros even if ERC fails for m, if allowed to run for more than m steps.

structure, which are not attributed to the hard-thermal-loop approximation. We
show that the new spectra originate from the mixing between a quark
(anti-quark) and an anti-quark hole (quark hole) caused by a ``resonant
scattering'' of the quasi-fermions with the thermally-excited soft mode which
has a small but finite excitation energy.

novel transversality is implemented with the help of a new dynamical multiplier
field. However, one expects that in physical observables such contributions

linear operator satisfying a relation, called the Rota-Baxter relation, that
generalizes the integration by parts formula. Most of the studies on
Rota-Baxter algebras have been for commutative algebras. Two constructions of
free commutative Rota-Baxter algebras were obtained by Rota and Cartier in the
1970s and a third one by Keigher and one of the authors in the 1990s in terms
of mixable shuffles. Recently, noncommutative Rota-Baxter algebras have
appeared both in physics in connection with the work of Connes and Kreimer on
renormalization in perturbative quantum field theory, and in mathematics
related to the work of Loday and Ronco on dendriform dialgebras and
trialgebras.
  This paper uses rooted trees and forests to give explicit constructions of
free noncommutative Rota--Baxter algebras on modules and sets. This highlights
the combinatorial nature of Rota--Baxter algebras and facilitates their further
study. As an application, we obtain the unitarization of Rota-Baxter algebras.

constructed using a thresholding schema, which has proven in the last decade in

inhomogeneous smoothness but has not been extensively developed in Learning
Theory. We will basically consider two particular situations. In the first
case, we consider the RKHS situation. In this case, we produce a new algorithm
and investigate its performances in $L\_2(\hat\rho\_X)$. The exponential rates
of convergences are proved to be almost optimal, and the regularity assumptions
are expressed in simple terms. The second case considers a more specified
situation where the $X\_i$'s are one dimensional and the estimator is a wavelet
thresholding estimate. The results are comparable in this setting to those
obtained in the RKHS situation as concern the critical value and the
exponential rates. The advantage here is that we are able to state the results
in the $L\_2(\rho\_X)$ norm and the regularity conditions are expressed in

  comments",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  Existence of a new type of oscillating synchronization that oscillates
between three different types of synchronizations (anticipatory, complete and
lag synchronizations) is identified in unidirectionally coupled nonlinear
time-delay systems having two different time-delays, that is feedback delay
with a periodic delay time modulation and a constant coupling delay.
Intermittent anticipatory, intermittent lag and complete synchronizations are
shown to exist in the same system with identical delay time modulations in both
the delays. The transition from anticipatory to complete synchronization and
from complete to lag synchronization as a function of coupling delay with
suitable stability condition is discussed. The intermittent anticipatory and
lag synchronizations are characterized by the minimum of similarity functions
and the intermittent behavior is characterized by a universal asymptotic
$-{3/2}$ power law distribution. It is also shown that the delay time carved
out of the trajectories of the time-delay system with periodic delay time
modulation cannot be estimated using conventional methods, thereby reducing the
possibility of decoding the message by phase space reconstruction.

obtained self-consistently for a large sample of finite, spherical nuclei, has
been expanded in terms of powers of A^{-1/3} (or inverse nuclear radius) and
the isospin excess (or neutron-to-proton asymmetry). In order to perform a
reliable extrapolation in the inverse radius, the calculations have been
carried out for nuclei with huge numbers of nucleons, of the order of 10^6. The
Coulomb interaction has been ignored to be able to approach nuclei of arbitrary
sizes and to avoid radial instabilities characteristic of systems with very
large atomic numbers. The main contribution to the fluctuating part of the
binding energy has been removed using the Green's function method to calculate
the shell correction. The limitations of applying the leptodermous expansion to
actual nuclei are discussed. While the leading terms in the macroscopic energy
expansion can be extracted very precisely, the higher-order, isospin-dependent
terms are prone to large uncertainties due to finite-size effects.

geometrical point of view using a canonical class of its transformations.
Rayleigh's point of inflection criterion and Fjortoft's condition of
instability of a homogenous shear-flow have been generalized here so that only
the profile carrying the point of inflection is modified by the variation of
density. This fulfils a persistent expectation in the literature. A pair of
bounds exists such that in any unstable flow the flow-curvature (a function of
flow-layers) exceeds the upper bound at some flow-layer and falls below the
lower bound at a higher layer. This is the main result proved here. Bounds are
obtained on the growth rate and the wave numbers of unstable modes, in
fulfillment of longstanding predictions of Howard. A result of Drazin and
Howard on the boundedness of the wave numbers is generalized to TGE. The
results above hold if the local Richardson number does not exceed 1/4 anywhere
in the flow, otherwise a weakening of the conditions necessary for instability
is seen. Conditions for the propagation of neutrally stable waves and bounds on
the phase speeds of destabilizing waves are obtained. It is also shown that the
set of complex wave velocities of normal modes of an arbitrary flow is bounded.
Fundamental solutions of TGE are obtained and their smoothness is examined.

thus well approximated by Poisson processes. We provide direct evidence that
for five human activity patterns the timing of individual human actions follow
non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events
separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of
human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when
individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the
tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few
experiencing very long waiting times. We discuss two queueing models that
capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations
on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the
waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution with
exponent alpha=3/2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length,
resulting in alpha=1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of
these two models to human activity patterns. Finally, we discuss possible
extension of the proposed queueing models and outline some future challenges in
exploring the statistical mechanisms of human dynamics.

describing in a very simple way the action of the tip and a viscoelastic

give false confidence concerning the data significance. In the context of
microarray experiments for detecting differentially expressed genes, recent
publications have addressed the problem of the efficiency of sample-pooling,
and some approximate formulas were provided for the power and sample size
calculations. It is desirable to have exact formulas for these calculations and
have the approximate results checked against the exact ones. We show that the
difference between the approximate and exact results can be large. In this
study, we have characterized quantitatively the effect of pooling samples on
the efficiency of microarray experiments for the detection of differential gene
expression between two classes. We present exact formulas for calculating the
power of microarray experimental designs involving sample pooling and technical
replications. The formulas can be used to determine the total numbers of arrays
and biological subjects required in an experiment to achieve the desired power
at a given significance level. The conditions under which pooled design becomes
preferable to non-pooled design can then be derived given the unit cost
associated with a microarray and that with a biological subject. This paper
thus serves to provide guidance on sample pooling and cost effectiveness. The
formulation in this paper is outlined in the context of performing microarray
comparative studies, but its applicability is not limited to microarray
experiments. It is also applicable to a wide range of biomedical comparative

  ed. W. Demopoulos and the author, Springer (Kluwer): University of Western
  Ontario Series in Philosophy of Science",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We develop and defend the thesis that the Hilbert space formalism of quantum
mechanics is a new theory of probability. The theory, like its classical
counterpart, consists of an algebra of events, and the probability measures
defined on it. The construction proceeds in the following steps: (a) Axioms for
the algebra of events are introduced following Birkhoff and von Neumann. All
axioms, except the one that expresses the uncertainty principle, are shared
with the classical event space. The only models for the set of axioms are
lattices of subspaces of inner product spaces over a field K. (b) Another axiom
due to Soler forces K to be the field of real, or complex numbers, or the
quaternions. We suggest a probabilistic reading of Soler's axiom. (c) Gleason's
theorem fully characterizes the probability measures on the algebra of events,
so that Born's rule is derived. (d) Gleason's theorem is equivalent to the
existence of a certain finite set of rays, with a particular orthogonality
graph (Wondergraph). Consequently, all aspects of quantum probability can be
derived from rational probability assignments to finite ""quantum gambles"". We
apply the approach to the analysis of entanglement, Bell inequalities, and the
quantum theory of macroscopic objects. We also discuss the relation of the
present approach to quantum logic, realism and truth, and the measurement
problem.

of local Clifford operations, Pauli measurements and classical communication.
It is shown that this hashing protocol outperforms previous versions by
exploiting information theory to a full extent an not only applying CNOTs as
local Clifford operations. Using the information-theoretical notion of a
strongly typical set, we calculate the asymptotic yield of the protocol as the
solution of a linear programming problem.

novel feature that it uses many identical quantum coins keeping at the same
time characteristic quantum features like the quadratically faster than the
classical spreading rate, and unexpected distribution cutoffs. A weak limit of
the position probability distribution (pd) is obtained, and universal
properties of this arch sine asymptotic distribution function are examined.
Questions of driving the walk are investigated by means of a quantum optical
interaction model that reveals robustness of quantum features of walker's
asymptotic pd, against stimulated and spontaneous quantum noise on the coin
system.

systems onto optical pulses is presented. Two off-resonant light pulses cross
the atomic medium in two orthogonal directions and are interferometrically
recombined in such a way that one of the outputs carries most of the
information stored in the medium. In contrast to previous schemes our approach
requires neither multiple passes through the medium nor feedback on the light
after passing the sample which makes the scheme very efficient. The price for
that is some added noise which is however small enough for the method to beat
the classical limits.

instance, the number of interfering trajectories can be adjusted in this

time-like interval strongly suggestes that measuring the polarization state of
a photon of an entangled pair changes the polarization state of the other
distant photon. Trough a very simple demonstration, the Wigner-D'Espagnat
inequality is used to show that in order to prove Bell's theorem neither the
assumption that there is a well-defined space of complete states $\lambda $ of
the particle pair and well-defined probability distribution $\rho (\lambda)$
over this space nor the use of counterfactuals is necessary. These results
reinforce the viewpoint that quantum mechanics implicitly presupposes some sort
of nonlocal connection between the particles of an entangled pair. As will
become evident from our discussion, relinquishing realism and/or free will
cannot solve this apparent puzzle.
