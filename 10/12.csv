fit by thermally emitting material with a color temperature of T$\sim 110$ K,
warmer than the majority of debris disks identified to date around Sun-like
stars. The object is not detected at 70$\mu$m with a 3$\sigma$ upper limit 6
times the expected photospheric flux. The spectrum of the infrared excess can
be explained by warm, optically thin material comprised of blackbody-like
grains of size $\gtrsim 7 \mu$m that reside in a belt orbiting the star at 4--6
AU. An alternate model dominated by smaller grains, near the blow-out size
$a\sim 0.5\mu$m, located at 30-40AU is also possible, but requires the dust to
have been produced recently since such small grains will be expelled from the
system by radiation pressure in $\sim$ few $\times 10^{2}$yrs.

been imaged in the near-infrared (NIR) in $J$ and $K_s$ on the 2.1m telescope
at OAN-SPM in Mexico. Isophotes as faint as $\mu_J$ = 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and
$\mu_{K_s}$ = 23 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ have been reached in most of the targets.
Surface brightness profiles can be fitted across the whole range of radii by
the sum of two components: a hyperbolic secant (sech) function, which is known
to fit the light profiles of dIs, and a Gaussian component, which quantifies
the starburst near the centre. Isophotal and total fitted NIR magnitudes have
been calculated, along with semimajor axes at $\mu_J$ = 23 mag arcsec$^{-2}$
and $\mu_{K_s}$ = 22 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The diffuse underlying component and
the young starburst have been quantified using the profile fitting. Most color
profiles show a constant color, between $J-K_s$=0.7 to 0.9 mag. The diffuse
component represents the overwhelming majority of the NIR light for most BCDs,
the starburst enhancing the flux by less than about 0.3 mag. Linear
correlations were found between the sech scale length and the sech magnitude,
and between the sech semimajor axis and the sech magnitude. Overall, galaxies
with more luminous diffuse components are larger and brighter in the centre.
The central burst correlates with the diffuse component, with brighter BCDs
having stronger star-bursts, suggesting that more massive objects are forming
stars more efficiently. BCDs lie on the ``fundamental plane'' defined by dwarf
irregulars (dISs) in Paper I, following the same relation between sech absolute
magnitude, sech central surface brightness, and the hydrogen line-width
$W_{20}$, although the scatter is larger than for the dIs. [one sentence cut]

sinusoidal signals in the light curves. Eleven of those correspond to
independent pulsation modes, and the remainder are combination frequencies. We
find some slow aperiodic variability such as that seemingly present in several
Beta Cephei stars. We perform mode identification from our colour photometry,
derive the spherical degree l for the five strongest modes unambiguously and
provide constraints on l for the weaker modes. We find a mixture of modes of 0
<= l <= 4. In particular, we prove that the previously suspected rotationally
split triplet within the modes of 12 Lac consists of modes of different l;
their equal frequency splitting must thus be accidental.
  One of the periodic signals we detected in the light curves is argued to be a
linearly stable mode excited to visible amplitude by nonlinear mode coupling
via a 2:1 resonance. We also find a low-frequency signal in the light
variations whose physical nature is unclear; it could be a parent or daughter
mode resonantly coupled. The remaining combination frequencies are consistent
with simple light-curve distortions.
  The range of excited pulsation frequencies of 12 Lac may be sufficiently
large that it cannot be reproduced by standard models. We suspect that the star
has a larger metal abundance in the pulsational driving zone, a hypothesis also
capable of explaining the presence of Beta Cephei stars in the LMC.

order to assess the effects of projection and spurious pairs in observational

observational results with a threshold at rp ~ 25 kpc/h for interactions to
effectively enhance star formation activity.
  For pairs within rp < 100 kpc/h, we estimated a ~27% contamination by
spurious pairs, reduced to ~19% for close systems. We also found that spurious
pairs affect more strongly high density regions with 17% of spurious pairs
detected for low density regions compared to 33% found in high density ones.
Also, we analysed the dependence of star formation on environment by defining
the usual projected density parameter for both pairs and isolated galaxies in
the simulations. We find the expected star formation-local density relation for
both galaxies in pairs and without a close companion, with a stronger density
dependence for close pairs which suggests a relevant role for interactions in

Deep Arecibo HI observations are presented of two gas-rich spiral galaxies
within 125 kpc projected distance of a Ly-alpha absorber at a similar velocity.
The galaxies investigated are close to edge-on and the absorbers lie almost
along their major axes, allowing for a comparison of the Ly-alpha absorber
velocities with galactic rotation. This comparison is used to examine whether
the absorbers are diffuse gas rotating with the galaxies' halos, outflow
material from the galaxies, or intergalactic gas in the low redshift cosmic
web. The results indicate that if the gas resides in the galaxies' halos it is
not rotating with the system and possibly counter-rotating. In addition, simple
geometry indicates the gas was not ejected from the galaxies and there are no
gas-rich satellites detected down to 3.6 - 7.5 x 10^6 Msun, or remnants of
satellites to 5-6 x 10^{18} cm^{-2}. The gas could potentially be infalling
from large radii, but the velocities and distances are rather high compared to
the high velocity clouds around the Milky Way. The most likely explanation is
the galaxies and absorbers are not directly associated, despite the vicinity of
the spiral galaxies to the absorbers (58-77 kpc from the HI edge). The spiral
galaxies reside in a filament of intergalactic gas, and the gas detected by the
absorber has not yet come into equilibrium with the galaxy. These results also
indicate that the massive, extended dark matter halos of spiral galaxies do not
commonly have an associated diffuse baryonic component at large radii.

using the high-speed CCD camera ULTRACAM and derived times of mid-eclipse, from
fitting of light curve models, with uncertainties as low as 0.06 s. The
observed rates of period change appear difficult to reconcile with any models
of orbital period change. If the observed period change reflects an angular
momentum loss, the average loss rate is consistent with the loss rates (via
magnetic stellar wind braking) used in standard models of close binary
evolution, which were derived from observations of much more massive cool
stars. Observations of low-mass stars such as NN Ser's secondary predict rates
of ~100 times lower than we observe. We show that magnetic activity-driven
changes in the quadrupole moment of the secondary star (Applegate, 1992) fail
to explain the period change by an order of magnitude on energetic grounds, but
that a light travel time effect caused by the presence of a third body in a
long (~ decades) orbit around the binary could account for the observed changes
in the timings of NN Ser's mid-eclipses. We conclude that we have either
observed a genuine angular momentum loss for NN Ser, in which case our
observations pose serious difficulties for the theory of close binary
evolution, or we have detected a previously unseen low-mass companion to the
binary.

magnetic field of 250 G with kG fields concentrated in its intergranular lanes,
and is representative of a plage region. To simulate filtergrams typically
obtained in CH- and CN-band observations we computed spatially resolved spectra
in both bands and integrated these spectra over 1 nm FWHM filter functions
centred at 430.5 nm and 388.3 nm, respectively. We find that the average
contrast of magnetic bright points in the simulated filtergrams is lower in the
CN-band by a factor of 0.96. This result strongly contradicts earlier
semi-empirical modeling and recent observations, which both etimated that the
bright-point contrast in the CN-band is \emph{higher} by a factor of 1.4. We
argue that the near equality of the bright-point contrast in the two bands in
the present simulation is a natural consequence of the mechanism that causes
magnetic flux elements to be particularly bright in the CN and CH filtergrams,
namely the partial evacuation of these elements and the concomitant weakening
of molecular spectral lines in the filter passbands. We find that the RMS
intensity contrast in the whole field-of-view of the filtergrams is 20.5% in
the G band and 22.0% in the CN band and conclude that this slight difference in
contrast is caused by the shorter wavelength of the latter. Both the
bright-point and RMS intensity contrast in the CN band are sensitive to the
precise choice of the central wavelength of the filter.

leveraged to realize a nearly background-free search, with nominal signal loss,

20-100 keV flux of ~3x10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 and is spatially coincident with
NGC 6334, a molecular cloud located in the Sagittarius arm of the Milky Way.
Diffuse X-ray emission has been reported from this region by ASCA and
interpreted as coming from five far-infrared cores located in the cloud.
However, the combined ASCA spectrum with a 9 keV temperature was difficult to
explain in terms of emission from young pre-main sequence stars known to be
embedded in the star forming regions. Detection of gamma-rays makes this
interpretation even more unrealistic and suggests the presence of a high energy
source in or behind the cloud. Follow up observations with Swift and archival
Chandra data allow us to disentangle the NGC6334 enigma by locating an
extragalactic object with the proper spectral characteristics to explain the
gamma-ray emission. The combined Chandra/IBIS spectrum is well fitted by an
absorbed power law with index 1.2+/-0.1, NH=1.4+/-0.1x10^23 cm^-2 and an
unabsorbed 2-10 keV flux of 0.5x10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1. This column density is
in excess of the galactic value implying that we are detecting a background

(LF) in the red r', i', and z' bands as derived from the FORS Deep Field (FDF).
Using the deep and homogeneous I-band selected dataset of the FDF we are able
to follow the red LFs over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.5. The results are
based on photometric redshifts for 5558 galaxies derived from the photometry in
9 filters achieving an accuracy of Delta z / (z_spec+1) ~ 0.03 with only ~ 1 %
outliers. Because of the depth of the FDF we can give relatively tight
constraints on the faint-end slope alpha of the LF: The faint-end of the red
LFs does not show a large redshift evolution and is compatible within 1 sigma
to 2 sigma with a constant slope over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 2.0.
Moreover, the slopes in r', i', and z' are very similar with a best fitting
value of alpha= -1.33 +- 0.03 for the combined bands. There is a clear trend of
alpha to steepen with increasing wavelength: alpha_(UV & u')=-1.07 +- 0.04 ->
alpha_(g' & B)=-1.25 +- 0.03 -> alpha_(r' & i' & z')=-1.33 +- 0.03. We show
that the wavelength dependence of the LF slope can be explained by the relative
contribution of different SED-type LFs to the overall LF, as different SED
types dominate the LF in the blue and red bands. Furthermore we also derive and
analyze the luminosity density evolution of the different SED types up to z ~
2. Based on the FDF data, we find only a mild brightening of M_star and
decrease of phi_star with increasing redshift. Therefore, from <z> ~ 0.5 to <z>
\~ 3 the characteristic luminosity increases by ~0.8, ~0.4 and ~0.4 magnitudes
in the r', i', and z' bands, respectively. Simultaneously the characteristic
density decreases by about 40 % in all analyzed wavebands. [abridged]

in clumps associated with the active star forming region in the northern part

part of Cha I show smaller than average N(C18O) / Av ratios and also very
shallow proportionality between N(C18O) and Av. The shallow proportionality
suggests that C18O is heavily depleted in these regions. As the degree of
depletion is proportional to the gas density, these regions probably contain
very dense, cold cores, which do not stand out in CO mappings. A comparison
with the dust temperature map derived from the ISO data shows that the most
prominent of the potentially depleted cores indeed coincides with a dust
temperature minimum. It seems therefore feasible to use N(C18O) and Av data
together for identifying old, dense cores in large scale mappings.

simple Ly-alpha emitter models,and then we apply it to the brightest Ly-alpha
emitter of a gasdynamics+N-body Adaptive Refinement Tree (ART) simulation at
z~8.We find that recombination rather than cooling radiation Ly-alpha photons
is the dominant contribution to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity of the
emitter,which is ~4.8x10e43 ergs/s.The size of the emitter is pretty
small,making it unresolved for currently available instruments.Its spectrum
before adding the Ly-alpha Gunn-Peterson absorption (GP) resembles that of
static media,despite some net inward radial peculiar motion.This is because for
such high optical depths as those in ART simulations,velocities of order some
hundreds km/s are not important.We add the GP in two ways.First we assume no
damping wing,corresponding to the situation where the emitter lies within the
HII region of a very bright quasar,and second we allow for the damping
wing.Including the damping wing leads to a maximum line brightness suppression
by roughly a factor of ~62.The line fluxes,even though quite faint for current

change in the visibility with the wavelength can be interpreted by the presence
of an optically thick disk responsible for the visibility in the continuum and
of a stellar wind traced by Br gamma and whose apparent size is 40% larger. We
validate this interpretation by building a model of the stellar environment
that combines a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk model
consisting of gas and dust, and a latitude-dependent stellar wind outflowing
above the disk surface. The continuum emission and visibilities obtained from
this model are fully consistent with the interferometric AMBER data. They agree
also with existing optical, near-infrared spectra and other broad-band

is surrounded by an equatorial flat disk that is possibly still accreting and
an outflowing wind which has a much higher velocity in the polar region than at

amplitude of the spatial Fourier modes corresponding to different wavevectors
in the inertial range, we compute the time correlation functions of the modal
amplitude. The modal vorticity dynamics exhibits two well separated time
scales: a short one which is scale dependant and related to the well known
sweeping effect (random advection), and a much longer one, of order the
integral time scale, which is not scale dependent. By computing the
cross-correlation of the amplitude of two different wavevectors, we evidence a
clear statistical dependance between scales, whatever their separation, at
variance with the original Kolmogorov 41 theory. We ascribe our experimental
results to a manifestation of a new type of statistical intermittency. We call
this new statistical feature a large scale time intermittency effect, in
contrast with the usual small scale spatial intermittency reported in Eulerian

about the spacetime metric of the massive black hole,and it is possible to
extract this information and experimentally identify (or not!) a Kerr black
hole.In this paper we lay the foundations for a practical `spacetime-mapping'
framework. Our work is based on the assumption that the massive body is not
necessarily a Kerr black hole, and that the vacuum exterior spacetime is
stationary axisymmetric,described by a metric which deviates slightly from the
Kerr metric. We first provide a simple recipe for building such a `quasi-Kerr'
metric by adding to the Kerr metric the deviation in the value of the
quadrupole moment. We then study geodesic motion in this metric,focusing on
equatorial orbits. We proceed by computing `kludge' waveforms which we compare
with their Kerr counterparts. We find that a modest deviation from the Kerr
metric is sufficient for producing a significant mismatch between the
waveforms, provided we fix the orbital parameters. This result suggests that an
attempt to use Kerr waveform templates for studying EMRIs around a non-Kerr
object might result in serious loss of signal-to-noise ratio and total number
of detected events. The waveform comparisons also unveil a `confusion' problem,
that is the possibility of matching a true non-Kerr waveform with a Kerr

effects of intermediate scale MSSM-charged exotics (ISME) (endemic to
quasi-realistic string models) can resolve this issue, pushing the MSSM scale
up to the string scale. However, for a generic string model, this implies that
the projected Lambda_U unification under ISD is accidental. If the true
unification scale is 5.0x10^(17) GeV, is it possible that illusionary
unification at 2.5x10^(17) GeV in the ISD scenario is not accidental? If it is
not, then under what conditions would the assumption of ISME in a WCHS model
imply apparent unification at Lambda_U when ISD is falsely assumed? Geidt's
""optical unification"" suggests that Lambda_U is not accidental, by offering a
mechanism whereby a generic MSSM scale Lambda_U < Lambda_H is guaranteed. A
WCHS model was constructed that offers the possibility of optical unification,
depending on the availability of anomaly-cancelling flat directions meeting
certain requirements. This paper reports on the systematic investigation of the
optical unification properties of the set of stringent flat directions of this
model. Stringent flat directions can be guaranteed to be F-flat to all finite
order (or to at least a given finite order consistent with electroweak scale
supersymmetry breaking) and can be viewed as the likely roots of more general
flat directions. Analysis of the phenomenology of stringent flat directions

order terms of the perturbation series are found by direct calculation of

series. Summing it, one can solve (in a certain approximation) various
strong-coupling problems. This approach is demonstrated by determining the
Gell-Mann - Low functions in \phi^4 theory, QED, and QCD for arbitrary coupling
constants. An overview of the mathematical theory of divergent series is

derivations of the Lipatov asymptotic forms are presented for some basic
problems in theoretical physics. A solution is proposed to the problem of
renormalon contributions, which hampered progress in this field in the late

a coupling constant of order unity and in the strong-coupling limit. An
interpretation of the Borel integral is given for 'non-Borel-summable' series.

polarizabilities on spin evolution in the resonance deuteron EDM experiment is
considered in details.
  It is shown that besides EDM the electric and magnetic polarizabilities also
contribute to the vertical spin component P_3. Moreover, the electric
polarizability contributes to the P_3 component even when the deuteron EDM is
supposed to be zero and thereby the electric polarizability can imitate the EDM
contribution. It is shown that unlike the vertical component of the spin P_3
the component P_{33} of polarization tensor does not contain contribution from
the electric polarizability, whereas contribution from the magnetic
polarizability reveals only when the deuteron EDM differs from zero.
  Moreover, it is also shown that when the angle $\vartheta$ between the spin
direction and the vertical axis meets the condition $\sin
\vartheta=\sqrt{{2/3}}$ ($\cos \vartheta=\sqrt{{1/3}}$), the initial value of
$P_{33}$ appears $P_{33}(0)=0$. As a result, EDM contribution to the measured
signal linearly growth in time starting from zero that is important for

  Therefore, measurement of the P_{33} component of deuteron tensor
polarization seems to be of particular interest, especially because the nonzero

to the P_3 component, which appearance can be aroused by the tensor electric
polarizability, rather than EDM).

integrating the first law of thermodynamics. In some respects it is more
satisfactory to have a calculation of the mass that is based directly upon the

paper, we evaluate the masses for the newly-discovered rotating black holes
using the conformal definition of Ashtekar, Magnon and Das (AMD), and show that

the Abbott-Deser (AD) approach, and show that this yields an identical answer
for the mass of the general rotating black hole in five-dimensional minimal

the AD procedure. We attribute these to ambiguities or pathologies of the
chosen decomposition into background AdS metric plus deviations when scalar
fields are present. The AMD approach, involving no decomposition into
background plus deviation, is not subject to such complications. Finally, we
also calculate the Euclidean action for the five-dimensional solution in
minimal gauged supergravity, showing that it is consistent with the quantum

applied to the Mathieu and Lame equations, to the case that the periodic
coefficient in the general Hill equation is an unbounded function of time. As a
result, we derive the formula for the characteristic exponent and calculate the

remaining well-localized objects, lose their coherence with time. This means
that, strictly speaking, all pulsons of the model considered are unstable.
Nevertheless, for the nodeless pulsons the rate of the coherence breaking in
narrow ranges of amplitudes is found to be very small, so that such pulsons can
be long-lived. Further, we use the obtaned stability-instability chart to
examine the Affleck-Dine type condensate. We conclude the oscillating

be inferred. This method, known as spectator tagging, can be used to study
electron scattering from high-momentum (off-shell) neutrons in deuterium. The
data were taken with a 5.765 GeV electron beam on a deuterium target in
Jefferson Laboratory's Hall B, using the CLAS detector. A reduced cross section
was extracted for different values of final-state missing mass $W^{*}$,
backward proton momentum $\vec{p}_{s}$ and momentum transfer $Q^{2}$. The data
are compared to a simple PWIA spectator model. A strong enhancement in the data
observed at transverse kinematics is not reproduced by the PWIA model. This
enhancement can likely be associated with the contribution of final state
interactions (FSI) that were not incorporated into the model. A ``bound neutron
structure function'' $F_{2n}^{eff}$ was extracted as a function of $W^{*}$ and
the scaling variable $x^{*}$ at extreme backward kinematics, where effects of
FSI appear to be smaller. For $p_{s}>400$ MeV/c, where the neutron is far
off-shell, the model overestimates the value of $F_{2n}^{eff}$ in the region of
$x^{*}$ between 0.25 and 0.6. A modification of the bound neutron structure
function is one of possible effects that can cause the observed deviation.

V_UCOM resulting from the Argonne V18 potential, bound nuclei are obtained
already on the Hartree-Fock level. However, the binding energies are smaller
than the experimental values because long-range correlations have not been
accounted for. Their inclusion by means of many-body perturbation theory leads
to a remarkable agreement with experimental binding energies over the whole

rapidly damped along the channel. The average foam flow rate depends
non-linearly on the applied gas pressure, displaying a threshold pressure due

both Quantum Theory and General Relativity in the well known superspace

exotic neutral 4-unit charge Coulomb systems like HH and HantiH leads to new
conclusions on the effect of charge-antisymmetry in nature. With singularities
in the HantiH PEC as found by Aldrovandi and Puget and by Junker and Bardsley,
any cusp in the HantiH PEC significantly affects the annihilation cross
section. This problem for the HantiH interaction generated many new wave
mechanical calculations mainly to remove annoying cusps. We review all
available PECs for 4-unit charge systems and find that corrections for the
Morgan-Hughes HantiH PEC can either go to the repulsive side (to the
conventionally expected annihilation channel) or to the opposite attractive
side (to the attractive branch of the observed PEC of natural molecular HH). We
observe that all theoretical HantiH PECs published thus far would intersect the
observed PEC of natural HH. This is, however, impossible with the non-crossing
rule. A classical ab initio calculation of the electrostatic perturbation
brings the HantiH PEC much closer to the observed HH PEC than to the PEC of the
annihilative channel. This new unprecedented result for long-range behavior in
4-unit charge Coulomb systems confirms that natural antiH must exist and that
molecule HH must be interpreted as HantiH. In fact, this seems to be the only
solution left, if PECs for systems HH and HantiH with the same symmetry cannot
cross.

different standpoints: (a) first by supposing that the stationary distribution
of our (Wiener powered) SM model is a Student distribution; (b) by supposing
that our model is based on a (non--Gaussian) L\'evy process whose increments
