explained without resorting to dark energy. Models of generalized modified
gravity, with inverse powers of the curvature can have late time accelerating
attractors without conflicting with solar system experiments. We have solved
the Friedman equations for the full dynamical range of the evolution of the
Universe. This allows us to perform a detailed analysis of Supernovae data in
the context of such models that results in an excellent fit. Hence, inverse
curvature gravity models represent an example of phenomenologically viable
models in which the current acceleration of the Universe is driven by curvature
instead of dark energy. If we further include constraints on the current
expansion rate of the Universe from the Hubble Space Telescope and on the age
of the Universe from globular clusters, we obtain that the matter content of
the Universe is 0.07 <= omega_m <= 0.21 (95% Confidence). Hence the inverse
curvature gravity models considered can not explain the dynamics of the
Universe just with a baryonic matter component.

on the determination of a common systematic component in Hipparcos catalogue
proper motions. The procedure is based only on positions, proper motions and
parallaxes, plus a special algorithm which is able to reveal systematic trends.
Our results come from two stellar samples. Sample 1 has 4566 stars and defines
a motion of apex (l,b)=(177.8,3.7)+/-(1.5,1.0) and space velocity V=27+/-1
km/s. Sample 2 has 4083 stars and defines a motion of apex
(l,b)=(5.4,-0.6)+/-(1.9,1.1) and space velocity V=32+/-2 km/s. Both groups are
distributed all over the sky and cover a large variety of spectral types, which
means that they do not belong to a specific stellar population. Herschel's
method is used to define the initial samples of stars and later to compute the
common space velocity. The intermediate process is based on the use of a
special algorithm to determine systematic components in the proper motions. As
an important contribution, this paper sets out a new way to study the
kinematics of the solar neighborhood, in the search for streams, associations,
clusters and any other space motion shared by a large number of stars, without
being restricted by the availability of radial velocities.

Arguments are given that W UMa-type systems are formed from detached binaries
which lose angular momentum via magnetized wind. This takes typically several
Gyr. Such an age is sufficient for the initially more massive component to
deplete hydrogen in its core and to fill the Roche lobe. As a result, mass
transfer occurs with a reversal of the mass ratio. After a fast mass exchange
the present primaries of W UMa-type binaries land close to ZAMS whereas the
secondaries develop small helium cores, which makes them considerably
over-sized relative to ZAMS stars of the same mass. As a result, both
components can fulfill the mass-radius relation for contact systems while being
in thermal equilibrium. This solves the ""Kuiper paradox"". Further mass transfer
in a contact phase proceeds on a nuclear time scale of the secondary. Hydrogen
rich matter is transferred to the primary in the first part of this phase. This
keeps the primary close to ZAMS. When the mass of the secondary decreases below
the mass of the original hydrogen-burning core, helium-rich matter is
transferred to the primary shifting it towards TAMS. This prediction agrees
with observations of the position of the components of contact binaries on the
mass-radium diagram. The ultimate fate of the binary is coalescence of both
components.

insulating ferromagnet in two dimensions. In addition to the quasiparticle
excitations, here spin waves or magnons, this magnetic system admits a family
of vortex solutions carrying two topological invariants, the winding number or
vorticity, and the polarization. A vortex is approximately described as a
particle moving about the system, endowed with an effective mass and acted upon
by a variety of forces. Classically, the vortex has an inter-vortex potential
energy giving a Coulomb-like force (attractive or repulsive depending on the
relative vortex vorticity), and a gyrotropic force, behaving as a self-induced
Lorentz force, whose direction depends on both topological indices. Expanding
semiclassically about a many-vortex solution, the vortices are quantized by
considering the scattered magnon states, giving a zero point energy correction
and a many-vortex mass tensor. The vortices cannot be described as independent
particles--that is, there are off-diagonal mass terms, such as 1/2 Mij vi vj,
that are non-negligible. This thesis examines the full vortex dynamics in
further detail by evaluating the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, which
describes the evolution of the vortex density matrix after the magnon modes
have been traced out. In addition to the set of forces already known, we find
new damping forces acting both longitudinally and transversely to the vortex
motion. The vortex motion within a collective cannot be entirely separated:
there are damping forces acting on one vortex due to the motion of another. The
effective damping forces have memory effects: they depend not only on the
current motion of the vortex collection but also on the motion history.

quantities involving hadrons. For successful LFD applications to hadron
phenomenology, however, treacherous points such as zero-mode contributions
should be taken into account. For a concrete example of zero-mode contribution,
we present Standard Model analysis of vector anomaly in the CP-even form
factors of W^{\pm} gauge bosons. Main distinguished features of LFD is
discussed in comparison with other Hamiltonian dynamics. We also present a
power counting method to correctly pin down which hadron form factors receive
the zero-mode contribution and which ones do not. Indications from our analysis
to hadron phenomenology are discussed.

problem; explaining hierarchies in particle phenomenology; yielding standard
cosmology, plus interesting nonstandard scenarios. Yet it has marked
shortcomings: we over-rely on a single toy model, Randall-Sundrum; we treat
matter and gravity in an ad hoc, asymmetric way; and we conceptualize
integrated 4D effective field theory inconsistently. I here construct sounder
4D effective field theories for matter and gravity in warped extra dimension --
whether Randall-Sundrum or higher codimension. I track both Planck and particle
scales through brane formation, beginning with fully extradimensional matter
and gravity, at unified scale, in gravitationally warped backgrounds with bulk
electroweak symmetry-breaking. This validates hierarchy solution, as warp
generically drives 4D effective Planck and particle scales apart. It evades
classic obstacles to warped confinement of matter: colocalizing particles and
assuring effective charge universality. Diverse particles do fail to
colocalize, generically and in discussed models; however, aggregate 4D
effective field theory still holds, since hierarchy solution fixes unresolvably
small extradimensional radius. Electromagnetic charge universality emerges
generically, and weak charge universality in the Randall-Sundrum case.

Since there is a canonical correspondence that associates with each Markov

polymorphism), as well as a stationary Markov chain, we can also speak about
generic polymorphisms and generic Markov chains. The most important and
inexpected generic properties of Markov operators (or Markov chains or

even existence of such Markov operators (the first example due to

operator spaces which generalize the row and column spaces R and C. We show
that separable infinite-dimensional Hilbertian JC*-triples are completely
isometric to an element of the set of (infinite) intersections of these spaces.
This set includes the operator spaces R, C, their intersection, and the space
spanned by creation operators on the full anti-symmetric Fock space. In fact,
we show that these new spaces are completely isometric to the space of creation
(resp. annihilation) operators on the anti-symmetric tensors of the Hilbert
space. Together with the finite-dimensional case studied in our previous paper,
this gives a full operator space classification of all rank-one JC*-triples in
terms of creation and annihilation operator spaces.
  We use the above to show that all contractive projections on a C*-algebra A
with infinite dimensional Hilbertian range are ``expansions'' (which we define
precisely) of normal contractive projections from the second dual of A onto a
Hilbertian space which is completely isometric to one of the four spaces
mentioned above. This generalizes the well known result, first proved for B(H)
by Robertson, that all Hilbertian operator spaces that are completely
contractively complemented in a C*-algebra are completely isometric to R or C.
We also compute various completely bounded Banach-Mazur distances between these
spaces.
