rise and the high [S/Fe] abundances for low [Fe/H], as claimed in the

increase in [S/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H] are probably twofold: uncertainties
in the measurements of the weak 8694 A lines, and systematic errors in
metallicity determinations from Fe I lines. The near-infrared sulfur triplet at
9212.9, 9228.1, and 9237.5 A are preferred for an abundance analysis of sulfur

generates a secondary anisotropy contribution to the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). While the effect is best described as a non-linear extension
to the well-known integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, due to mathematical
coincidences, the anisotropy contribution is also described as the lensing of
the dipole seen in the rest-frame of a moving mass. Given the closeness, there
is a remote possibility that local concentrations of mass in the form of the
Great Attractor and the Shapley concentration generate large angular scale
fluctuations in CMB and could potentially be responsible, at least partly, for
some of the low-multipole anomalies in WMAP data. While the local anisotropy
contribution peaks at low multipoles, for reasonable models of the mass and
velocity distributions associated with local super structures we find that the
amplitude of temperature anisotropies is at most at a level of 10$^{-2}$ $\mu$K
and is substantially smaller than primordial fluctuations. It is extremely
unlikely that the momentum density of local mass concentrations is responsible
for any of the large angular scale anomalies in WMAP data.

fit the observed SED satisfactorily. The internal host extinction is low (A_v

massive stars (in the mass range 10 - 30 $M_{\odot}$) by r-process, during the
explosive event of supernovae of type II, and that europium is a pure r-process

collisionless collapse that can lead to equilibria of the exceptional type?
What is the intrinsic structural property that is responsible for the sometimes
noted exceptional stability behavior? To clarify these issues, we have
performed a series of simulations of collisionless collapse that start from
homogeneous, highly symmetrized, cold initial conditions and, because of such
special conditions, are characterized by very little mixing. For these runs,
the end-states can be associated with large values of the global pressure
anisotropy parameter up to 2K_r/K_T \approx 2.75. The highly anisotropic
equilibrium states thus constructed show no significant traces of radial
anisotropy in their central region, with a very sharp transition to a radially
anisotropic envelope occurring well inside the half-mass radius (around 0.2
r_M). To check whether the existence of such almost perfectly isotropic
""nucleus"" might be responsible for the apparent suppression of the radial orbit
instability, we could not resort to equilibrium models with the above
characteristics and with analytically available distribution function; instead,
we studied and confirmed the stability of configurations with those
characteristics by initializing N-body approximate equilibria (with given
density and pressure anisotropy profiles) with the help of the Jeans equations.

selected nearby clusters of galaxies in directions of Galactic latitude $|b| >$
30$^o$. The profiles were compared in detail with the expected CMB
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) caused by these clusters, with the hot gas
properties of each cluster inferred observationally by applying gas
temperatures as measured by ASCA to isothermal $\beta$ models of the ROSAT
X-ray surface brightness profiles, and with the WMAP point spread function
fully taken into consideration. After co-adding the 31 cluster field, it
appears that WMAP detected the SZE in all three bands. Quantitatively, however,
the observed SZE only accounts for about 1/4 of the expected decrement. The
discrepancy represents too much unexplained extra flux: in the W band, the
detected SZE corresponds on average to 5.6 times less X-ray gas mass within a
10 arcmin radius than the mass value given by the ROSAT $\beta$ model. We
examined critically how the X-ray prediction of the SZE may depend on our
uncertainties in the density and temperature of the hot intracluster plasma,
and emission by cluster radio sources. Although our comparison between the
detected and expected SZE levels is subject to a margin of error, the fact
remains that the average observed SZE depth and profile are consistent with
those of the primary CMB anisotropy, i.e. in principle the average WMAP
temperature decrement among the 31 rich clusters is too shallow to accomodate
any extra effect like the SZE. A unique aspect of this SZE investigation is
that because all the data being analyzed are in the public domain, our work is
readily open to the scrutiny of others.

optically-selected sample of normal star forming galaxies in nearby clusters as
observed by GALEX. The internal attenuation is estimated using three
independent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared to
far-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the Balmer
decrement. We confirm that normal galaxies follow a L_TIR/L_FUV-beta relation
offset from the one observed for starburst galaxies. This offset is found to
weakly correlate with the birthrate parameter, thus with the galaxy star
formation history. We study the correlations of dust attenuation with other
global properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gas
attenuation, Halpha emission and mass surface density. Metal-rich, massive
galaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the UV than are small
systems. For the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower L_TIR/L_FUV
ratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in the
L_TIR/L_FUV-beta relation. Unexpectedly we find however that normal star
forming galaxies follow exactly the same relationship between metallicity and
ultraviolet spectral slope beta determined for starbursts, complicating our
understanding of dust properties. This result might indicate a different dust
geometry between normal galaxies and starbursts, but it could also be due to
aperture effects eventually present in the IUE starbursts dataset. The present
multiwavelength study allows us to provide some empirical relations from which
the total infrared to far ultraviolet ratio (L_TIR/L_FUV) can be estimated when

is a combination of primary bremsstrahlung photons $I_P(\epsilon)$ with a
spectrally modified component from photospheric Compton backscatter of downward
primary emission. The latter can be significant, distorting or hiding the true
features of the primary spectrum which are key diagnostics for acceleration and
propagation of high energy electrons and of their energy budget. For the first
time in solar physics, we use a Green's function approach to the backscatter
spectral deconvolution problem, constructing a Green's matrix including
photoelectric absorption. This approach allows spectrum-independent extraction
of the primary spectrum for several HXR flares observed by the {\it Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager} (RHESSI). We show that the observed and
primary spectra differ very substantially for flares with hard spectra close to
the disk centre. We show in particular that the energy dependent photon
spectral index $\gamma (\epsilon)=-d \log I/d \log \epsilon$ is very different
for $I_P(\epsilon)$ and for $I(\epsilon)$ and that inferred mean source
electron spectra ${\bar F}(E)$ differ greatly. Even for a forward fitting of a
parametric ${\bar F}(E)$ to the data, a clear low-energy cutoff required to fit
$I(\epsilon)$ essentially disappears when the fit is to $I_P(\epsilon)$ - i.e.
when albedo correction is included. The self-consistent correction for
backscattered photons is thus shown to be crucial in determining the energy
spectra of flare accelerated electrons, and hence their total number and

imaging of two fields with recent star formation activity in the Tarantula
region. A population of objects with Halpha and/or Balmer continuum excess was
identified. On account of the intense Halpha emission (equivalent widths up to
several tens of Angstroms), its correlation with the Balmer continuum excess
and the stars' location on the HR diagram, we interpret them as low mass (~1-2
Mo) Pre-Main Sequence stars. In this framework, the data show that coeval high
and low mass stars have significantly different spatial distributions, implying
that star formation processes for different ranges of stellar masses are rather
different and/or require different initial conditions. We find that the overall
slope of the mass function of the young population is somewhat steeper than the
classical Salpeter value and that the star formation density of this young
component is 0.2-0.4 Mo/yr/kpc2, i.e. intermediate between the value for an
active spiral disk and that of a starburst region. The uncertainties associated
with the determination of the slope of the mass function and the star formation
density are thoroughly discussed.

system Z~Andromedae are presented. Outbursts in systems of this type occur when
the accretion rate exceeds the upper limit of the steady burning range.
Therefore, in order to realize the transition from a quiescent to an active
state it is necessary to find a mechanism able to sufficiently increase the
accretion rate on a time scale typical to the duration of outburst development.
  Our calculations have confirmed the transition mechanism from quiescence to
outburst in classic symbiotic systems suggested earlier on the basis of 2D
calculations (Bisikalo et al, 2002). The analysis of our results have shown
that for wind velocity of 20 km/s an accretion disc forms in the system. The
accretion rate for the solution with the disc is ~22.5-25% of the mass loss
rate of the donor, that is, ~4.5-5*10^(-8)Msun/yr for Z And. This value is in
agreement with the steady burning range for white dwarf masses typically
accepted for this system. When the wind velocity increases from 20 to 30 km/s
the accretion disc is destroyed and the matter of the disc falls onto the
accretor's surface. This process is followed by an approximately twofold
accretion rate jump. The resulting accretion rate growth is sufficient for
passing the upper limit of the steady burning range, thereby bringing the
system into an active state. The time during which the accretion rate is above
the steady burning value is in a very good agreement with observations.
  The analysis of the results presented here allows us to conclude that small
variations in the donor's wind velocity can lead to the transition from the
disc accretion to the wind accretion and, as a consequence, to the transition
from quiescent to active state in classic symbiotic stars.

continuum emission derives from the dense gas in an ionized accretion flow that
forms an ionized disk or torus around a group of stars in the center of the
cluster. The inward motion observed in the accretion flow suggests that despite
the equivalent luminosity and ionizing radiation of several O stars, neither
radiation pressure nor thermal pressure has reversed the accretion flow. The
observations indicate why the radiation pressure of the stars and the thermal
pressure of the HII region are not effective in reversing the accretion flow.
The observed rate of the accretion flow, 0.001 solar masses/yr, is sufficient
to form massive stars within the time scale imposed by their short main
sequence lifetimes. A simple model of disk accretion relates quenched HII

observations of different kinds have shed light on different aspects of the

evidence of a water envelope (MOLsphere) that in some studies is found to be
optically thick in the mid-infrared. In this paper, we present high-resolution,
mid-infrared spectra of Betelgeuse recorded with the TEXES spectrograph. The
spectra clearly show absorption features of water vapor and OH. We show that a
spectrum based on a spherical, hydrostatic model photosphere with T_eff = 3600
K, an effective temperature often assumed for Betelgeuse, fails to model the
observed lines. Furthermore, we show that published MOLspheres scenarios are
unable to explain our data. However, we are able to model the observed spectrum
reasonably well by adopting a cooler outer photospheric structure corresponding
to T_mod = 3250 K. The success of this model may indicate the observed
mid-infrared lines are formed in cool photospheric surface regions. Given the
uncertainties of the temperature structure and the likely presence of
inhomogeneities, we cannot rule out the possibility that our spectrum could be
mostly photospheric, albeit non-classical. Our data put new, strong constraints
on atmospheric models of Betelgeuse and we conclude that continued
investigation requires consideration of non-classical model photospheres as
well as possible effects of a MOLsphere. We show that the mid-infrared
water-vapor features have great diagnostic value for the environments of K and
M (super-) giant star atmospheres.

finite source size effects both photometrically and astrometrically. Using
observed finite source size events as examples, we show that the fringe
visibility can be affected by 5% - 10%, and the closure phase by a few degrees:
readily detectable by ground and space interferometers. Such detections will
offer unique information about the lens-source trajectory relative to the
baseline of the interferometers. Combined with photometric finite source size
effects, interferometry offers a way to measure the angular sizes of the source

  Limb-darkening changes the visibility by a small amount compared with a

  Methods: We perform seven cosmological simulations to emphasise the role of
both the disk-to-halo mass ratio and of the Toomre parameter, Q, on the
evolution of the disk.We also compare our fully cosmological cases with
corresponding isolated simulations where the same halo, is extracted from the
cosmological scenario and evolved in physical coordinates.
  Results: A long living bar, lasting about 10 Gyr, appears in all our
simulations. In particular, disks expected to be stable according to classical
criteria, form indeed weak bars. We argue that such a result is due to the
dynamical properties of our cosmological halo which is far from stability and
isotropy, typical of the classical halos used in literature; it is dynamically
active, endowed of substructures and infall.
  Conclusions: At least for mild self-gravitating disks, the study of the bar
instability using isolated isotropic halos, in gravitational equilibrium, can
lead to misleading results. Furthermore, the cosmological framework is needed
for quantitatively investigating such an instability.

relevant many-body correlations introduced by the hamiltonian, but the
dimensionality of the Hilbert space is greatly reduced. We apply the doorway

oriented normal to the direction of the shear gradient (common stress case).
The director at the interface is oriented parallel to the interface (planar). A
fixed average shear rate is imposed with Lees-Edwards boundary conditions, and
the heat is dissipated with a profile-unbiased thermostat. First we study the
properties of the interface at one particular shear rate in detail. The local
interfacial profiles and the capillary wave fluctuations of the interfaces are
calculated and compared with those of the corresponding equilibrium interface.
Under shear, the interfacial width broadens and the capillary wave amplitudes
at large wavelengths increase. The strain is distributed inhomogeneously in the
system (shear banding), the local shear rate in the nematic region being
distinctly higher than in the paranematic region. Surprisingly, we also observe
(symmetry breaking) flow in the {\em vorticity} direction, with opposite
direction in the nematic and the paranematic state. Finally, we investigate the
stability of the interface for other shear rates and construct a nonequilibrium

LC trie) in which a full subtree of a node is compressed to a single node of
degree being the size of the subtree. Recent experimental results indicated a
'dramatic improvement' when full subtrees are replaced by partially filled
subtrees. In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification of these
experimental results showing, among others, a rather moderate improvement of
the search time over the original LC tries. For such an analysis, we assume
that n strings are generated independently by a binary memoryless source with p
denoting the probability of emitting a 1. We first prove that the so called
alpha-fillup level (i.e., the largest level in a trie with alpha fraction of
nodes present at this level) is concentrated on two values with high
probability. We give these values explicitly up to O(1), and observe that the
value of alpha (strictly between 0 and 1) does not affect the leading term.
  This result directly yields the typical depth (search time) in the alpha-LC
tries with p not equal to 1/2, which turns out to be C loglog n for an
explicitly given constant C (depending on p but not on alpha). This should be
compared with recently found typical depth in the original LC tries which is C'
loglog n for a larger constant C'. The search time in alpha-LC tries is thus
smaller but of the same order as in the original LC tries.

configurations of classical fields. This is the case both in perturbation
theory and in Wilson's nonperturbative lattice field theory. D-theory is an
alternative nonperturbative formulation of field theory in which classical
fields emerge from the low-energy collective dynamics of discrete quantum
variables (quantum spins and their gauge analogs -- quantum links) which
undergo dimensional reduction. D-theory was developed some time ago as a
discrete approach to U(1) and SU(2) pure gauge theories, extended to SU(N)
gauge theories and full QCD, and also applied to a variety of other models. On
the practical side, D-theory provides a framework for the development of
efficient numerical methods, such as cluster algorithms. For example, in the
D-theory formulation of CP(N-1) models one can simulate efficiently at non-zero
chemical potential or at non-zero vacuum angle theta. On the conceptual side,
D-theory offers a natural solution for the nonperturbative hierarchy problem of
chiral symmetry in QCD. We also take a broader nonperturbative view on
fundamental physics and speculate that D-theory variables -- i.e. quantum spins
and quantum links -- may be promising candidates for the physical degrees of
freedom that Nature has chosen to regularize the standard model physics at
ultra-short distances.

$V$ in string units. This arises in part from an exponentially growing density

arises from the fact that the sigma model on a Riemann surface can be naturally
completed by many gauged linear sigma models, whose RG flows approximate time
evolution in the full string backgrounds arising from this in the limit of
large dimensionality. In recent examples of spacelike singularity resolution by
tachyon condensation, the singularity is ultimately replaced by a phase with

existence of large homogeneous sets for partitions on k-tuples of words (for

we establish an extension of the partition theorem of Carlson about words and
of the (more general) partition theorem of Furstenberg-Katznelson about
combinatorial subspaces of the set of words (generating from k-tuples of words
for any fixed natural number k) into a partition theorem about combinatorial
subspaces (generating from Schreier-type sets of words of order any fixed

Carlson's infinitary Nash-Williams type (and Ellentuck type) partition theorem
about infinite sequences of variable words into a theorem, in which an infinite
sequence of variable words and a binary partition of all the finite sequences
of words, one of whose components is, in addition, a tree, are assumed,
concluding that all the Schreier-type finite reductions of an infinite
reduction of the given sequence have a behavior determined by the
Cantor-Bendixson ordinal index of the tree-component of the partition, falling
in the tree-component above that index and in its complement below it.

correspondence) in the framework of the geometric Langlands program. We
consider the (unramified) dual reductive pair H=GO_{2m}, G=GSp_{2n} over a
smooth projective curve X (our H is assumed to be split on an etale two-sheeted
covering Y of X).
  Let Bun_G and Bun_H be the stack of G-torsors and H-torsors on X. We define
and study functors F_G and F_H between the derived categories D(Bun_G) and
D(Bun_H) that are analogs of the classical theta-lifting operators.
  One of the main results is the geometric Langlands functoriality for the dual
pair (H=GO_2, G=GL_2), where GO_2 is the direct image of the multiplicative
group from a nontrivial etale covering Y to X. The functor F_G from D(Bun_H) to
D(Bun_G) commutes with Hecke operators with respect to the corresponding map of
Langlands L-groups G^L\to H^L.
  As an application, we calculate Waldspurger periods of cuspidal automorphic
sheaves on Bun_{GL_2} and Bessel periods of theta-lifts from Bun_{GO_4} to
Bun_{GSp_4}. Based on these calculations, we give three conjectural
constructions of certain automorphic sheaves on Bun_{GSp_4} (one of them makes
sense for D-modules only).

and the average is over newforms f of prime level N and coefficients a_p(f),

as N goes to infinity is governed by a measure \mu_p, which is the Plancherel
measure at p when \chi(p)=-1, but is new if \chi(p)=1; as p goes to infinity
both measures approach the Sato-Tate measure. A particular consequence of our
refinement is that for any non-empty interval J in [-2,2], there are infinitely
many primes N, which are inert in K, such that for some f of level N, a_p(f) is
in J and L(1/2, f)L(1/2,f,\chi) is non-zero.

attention due in part to experimental studies in diblock copolymers and
electroconvection. One surprising result has been the relative slow dynamics
associated with the growth of striped domains. One potential source of the slow
dynamics is the pinning of defects in the periodic potential of the stripes. Of
interest is whether or not external noise will have a significant impact on the
domain ordering, perhaps by reducing the pinning and increasing the rate of
ordering. In contrast, we present experiments using electroconvection in which
we show that a particular type of external noise decreases the rate of domain

that the neutron comprised a proton and an electron was diffusely taken into
account after the discovery of the neutron. Moreover, uncertainties persisted
about the composition of beryllium radiation until it was realized that the
latter comprised both neutrons and gamma-rays. The interaction of neutrons with
matter and nuclei was soon investigated. Both a spatial symmetry, a symmetry of
charge, and a symmetry in the nuclear reactions soon emerged. The relation of
negative beta-decay to the neutron abundance in nuclei was moreover reviewed.
Positive beta-radioactivity induced by alpha-particles was eventually
announced, having been foreseen some weeks before. Accelerated deutons and
protons shortly afterwards revealed to be efficient in inducing radioactivity.
The physics institute in Rome got ready to start research on neutrons, but
apparently it only planned to go through alpha-induced radioactivity, at first.
If so, it is then plausible that some new results achieved by foreign
laboratories eventually bent Fermi to neutrons. Fermi's discovery of
neutron-induced radioactivity is reviewed with regard to investigations then
current, once more showing simplicity as a distinctive trait of Fermi's way of

that a clock using alkaline earth-like atoms such as Yb could achieve a

division of a single cell into two daughter cells. In the case of DNA damage by
radiation or chemicals, the damage checkpoints in the $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$
phases of the cell cycle are activated. This results in an arrest of the cell
cycle so that the DNA damage can be repaired. Once this is done, the cell
continues with its usual cycle of activity. We study a mathematical model of
the DNA damage checkpoint in the $G_{2}$ phase which arrests the transition
from the $G_{2}$ to the $M$ (mitotic) phase of the cell cycle. The tumor
suppressor protein p53 plays a key role in activating the pathways leading to
cell cycle arrest in mammalian systems. If the DNA damage is severe, the p53
proteins activate other pathways which bring about apoptosis, i.e., programmed
cell death. Loss of the p53 gene results in the proliferation of cells
containing damaged DNA, i.e., in the growth of tumors which may ultimately
become cancerous. There is some recent experimental evidence which suggests
that the mutation of a single copy of the p53 gene (in the normal cell each
gene has two identical copies) is sufficient to trigger the formation of
tumors. We study the effect of reducing the gene copy number of the p53 and two
other genes on cell cycle arrest and obtain results consistent with
experimental observations.

wich has a D dimensional Hilbert space. The results we obtain suggest that
regular and chaotic environments are not distinguishable from each other in a

t*~log(D). Howeber, chaotic environments continue to be effective over
exponentially longer timescales while regular environments tend to reach
saturation much sooner. We present both numerical and analytical results
supporting this conclusion. The family of chaotic evolutions we consider

Specifically, we calculate the predictions for the change in position of a
charged scalar particle, moving in three-dimensional space, due to the effect
of radiation reaction in the one-photon-emission process in quantum
electrodynamics. The scalar particle is assumed to be accelerated for a finite
period of time by a three-dimensional electromagnetic potential dependent only
on one of the spacetime coordinates. We perform this calculation in the
$\hbar\to 0$ limit and show that the change in position agrees with that
obtained in classical electrodynamics with the Lorentz-Dirac force treated as a
perturbation. We also show for a time-dependent but space-independent
electromagnetic potential that the forward-scattering amplitude at order $e^2$
does not contribute to the position change in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit after the
mass renormalization is taken into account.
