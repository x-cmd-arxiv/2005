high-energy $\gamma$-ray source HESS J1825--137 with the pulsar wind nebula
(commonly referred to as G 18.0--0.7) of the $2.1\times 10^{4}$ year old
Vela-like pulsar PSR B1823--13. HESS J1825--137 was detected with a
significance of 8.1 $\sigma$ in the Galactic Plane survey conducted with the
H.E.S.S. instrument in 2004. The centroid position of HESS J1825--137 is offset
by 11\arcmin south of the pulsar position. \emph{XMM-Newton} observations have
revealed X-ray synchrotron emission of an asymmetric pulsar wind nebula
extending to the south of the pulsar. We argue that the observed morphology and
TeV spectral index suggest that HESS J1825--137 and G 18.0--0.7 may be
associated: the lifetime of TeV emitting electrons is expected to be longer
compared to the {\it XMM-Newton} X-ray emitting electrons, resulting in
electrons from earlier epochs (when the spin-down power was larger)
contributing to the present TeV flux. These electrons are expected to be
synchrotron cooled, which explains the observed photon index of $\sim 2.4$, and
the longer lifetime of TeV emitting electrons naturally explains why the TeV
nebula is larger than the X-ray size. Finally, supernova remnant expansion into
an inhomogeneous medium is expected to create reverse shocks interacting at
different times with the pulsar wind nebula, resulting in the offset X-ray and
TeV $\gamma$-ray morphology.

observed Wolf-Rayet (W-R) mass-loss rates has been called into question in
recent theoretical studies. The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the
plausibility of line driving of W-R winds within the standard approach using
the Sobolev approximation while advancing the conceptual understanding of this
topic. Due to the multiple scattering required in this context, of particular
importance is the role of photon frequency redistribution into spectral gaps,
which in the extreme limit yields the statistical Sobolev-Rosseland (SSR) mean
approximation. Interesting limits to constrain are the extremes of no frequency
redistribution, wherein the small radii and corresponding high W-R surface
temperature induces up to twice the mass-loss rate relative to cooler stars,
and the SSR limit, whereby the reduced efficiency of the driving drops the mass
flux by as much as an order of magnitude whenever there exist significant gaps
in the spectral line distribution. To see how this efficiency drop might be
sufficiently avoided to permit high W-R mass loss, we explore the suggestion
that ionization stratification may serve to fill the gaps globally over the
wind. We find that global ionization changes can only fill the gaps
sufficiently to cause about a 25% increase in the mass-loss rate over the local
SSR limit. Higher temperatures and more ionization states (especially of iron)
may be needed to achieve optically thick W-R winds, unless strong clumping
corrections eliminate the need for such winds.

during spectroscopic observations of the nucleus of M31. We located the site of
M31 RV in the HST frames precisely through astrometric registration with

its extent is less than ~1.7 pc.
  The stellar population at the outburst site consists purely of old red
giants; there is no young population, such as seen around V838 Mon. There are
no stars of unusual color at the site, suggesting that M31 RV had faded below
HST detectability in the 11 years since outburst, that it is an unresolved

complete orbit of the longest period polar, V1309 Ori. The X-ray light curve is
dominated by a short, bright phase interval with EPIC pn count rates reaching
up to 15 cts/sec per 30 sec resolution bin. The bright phase emission is well
described by a single blackbody component with kT_bb = (45 +- 3) eV. The
absence of a bremsstrahlung component at photon energies above 1 keV yields a
flux ratio F_bb/F_br > 6700. This represents the most extreme case of a soft
X-ray excess yet observed in an AM Herculis star. The bright, soft X-ray
emission is subdivided into a series of individual flare events supporting the
hypothesis that the soft X-ray excess in V1309 is caused by accretion of dense
blobs. In addition to the bright phase emission, a faint, hard X-ray component
is visible throughout the binary orbit with an almost constant count rate of
0.01 cts/sec. Spectral modelling indicates that this emission originates from a
complex multi-temperature plasma. At least three components of an optically
thin plasma with temperatures kT= 0.065, 0.7, and 2.9 keV are required to fit
the observed flux distribution. The faint phase emission is occulted during the
optical eclipse. Eclipse ingress lasts about 15--20 min and is substantially
prolonged beyond nominal ingress of the white dwarf. This and the comparatively
low plasma temperature provide strong evidence that the faint-phase emission is
not thermal bremsstrahlung from a post-shock accretion column above the white
dwarf. A large fraction of the softer faint-phase emission could be explained
by scattering of photons from the blackbody component in the infalling material
above the accretion region. The remaining hard X-ray flux could be produced in
the coupling region, so far unseen in other polars.

optical spectrum for this afterglow. It shows two probable absorption systems
at z=0.80 and z=1.02, where the highest redshift most likely reflects the
distance to the host galaxy. A third system may be detected at z=0.77. HST
imaging of the field, obtained 4 months after the burst, has resulted in the
detection of two amorphous regions of emission, one at the projected afterglow
position, and the other 0.6"" away. The spectrum shows a depression in flux in
between 4000 A and 5500 A. This could be the result of a 2175 A-type extinction
feature in the host of GRB991216, but at a rather red wavelength of 2360 A. If
this interpretation is correct, it is the first time the extinction feature is
seen in a GRB afterglow spectrum. It is centered at a wavelength similar to
that of the ultra-violet (UV) bumps inferred from observations of a few
UV-strong, hydrogen-poor stars in the Galaxy. All significant absorption lines
(except for one) detected in the spectrum of GRB011211 are identified with
lines originating in a single absorption system at z=2.142+/-0.002, the

absorption line in the host, to which we fit a neutral hydrogen column density
of log N(HI)=20.4+/-0.2, which indicates that it is a damped Lyman alpha
system. Using a curve-of-growth analysis, we estimate the Si, Fe and Al
metallicity at the GRB011211 redshift. For GRB021211, we detect a single

the distribution of star formation histories changes qualitatively above a
characteristic stellar surface mass density of 3x10^8 M_sol kpc^-2,
corresponding to the transition between disk-dominated and bulge-dominated
galaxies. When we average over subpopulations of galaxies with densities below
this value, we find that subpopulations of all masses form their stars at the
same average rate per unit stellar mass. However, the scatter in galaxy colours
and emission line strengths is larger for more compact galaxies of a given
mass. This suggests that star formation occurs in shorter, higher amplitude
events in galaxies with smaller sizes. Above the characteristic density, galaxy
growth through star formation shuts down. We propose that star formation events
are triggered when cold gas is accreted onto a galaxy. We have used the new
high resolution Millennium Simulation of structure formation in a concordance
LCDM Universe to quantify the incidence of these accretion events and we show
that the observational data are well fit by a model in which the consumption
time of accreted gas decreases with the surface density of the galaxy as t_cons
\propto mu*^-1. The dark matter halos hosting massive galaxies with high
densities are also expected to grow through accretion, but the observations
indicate that star formation in bulge- dominated galaxies is no longer coupled

asymmetry is ~ 10^-4, a value insensitive to both frequency and power spectrum.
We determine the smallest multipole ranges exhibiting significant asymmetry,
and find twelve, including l=[2,3] and [6,7], for which the significance -> 0.
In these ranges there is an improbable association between the direction of
maximum significance and the ecliptic plane (p ~ 0.01). Also, contours of least
significance follow great circles inclined relative to the ecliptic at the
largest scales. The great circle for l=[2,3] passes over previously reported
preferred axes and is insensitive to frequency, while the great circle for
l=[6,7] is aligned with the ecliptic poles. We examine how changing map-making
parameters affects asymmetry, and find that at large scales, it is rendered
insignificant if the magnitude of the WMAP dipole vector is increased by
approximately 1-3 sigma (or 2-6 km/s). While confirmation of this result would
require data recalibration, such a systematic change would be consistent with
observations of frequency-independent asymmetry. We conclude that the use of an
incorrect dipole vector, in combination with a systematic or foreground process
associated with the ecliptic, may help to explain the observed asymmetry.

through collapsing gas clouds, representing proto-galaxies that are caught in
the process of their assembly. Such galaxies produce Lya flux over an extended
solid angle from a spatially extended Lya emissivity and/or from scattering
effects. We study the effect of the gas distribution and kinematics, and of the
Lya emissivity profile, on the emergent spectrum and surface brightness
distribution. The emergent Lya spectrum is typically double-peaked and
asymmetric. In practice, the blue peak is significantly enhanced and the red
peak, in most cases, will be undetectable. The resulting effective blueshift,
combined with scattering in the intergalactic medium, will render extended Lya
emission from collapsing protogalaxies difficult to detect beyond redshift z=4.
The surface brightness distribution is typically flat, and a strong wavelength
dependence of its slope (with preferential flattening at the red side of the
line) would be a robust indication that Lya photons are being generated (rather
than just scattered) in a spatially extended region around the galaxy. We also
find that for self-ionized clouds whose effective Lya optical depth is less
than 10^3, infall and outflow models can produce nearly identical spectra and
surface brightness distributions, and are difficult to distinguish from one
another. The presence of deuterium with a cosmic abundance may produce a narrow
but detectable dip in the spectra of systems with moderate hydrogen column
densities, in the range 10^18-10^20 cm^-2. Finally, we present a new analytic
solution for the emerging Lya spectrum in the limiting case of a static uniform

recent observations of extended Lya blobs (LABs) at high redshift. We suggest,
based on the angular size, energetics, as well as the relatively shallow
surface brightness profiles, and double-peaked spectra, that several of these

should reveal a preferential flattening of the surface brightness profile at

Balmer alpha wavelengths should reveal the intrinsic Lya emissivity and allow
its separation from radiative transfer effects. We show that Lya scattering by
infalling gas can reproduce the observed spectrum of Steidel et al's LAB2 as
accurately as a recently proposed outflow model. Finally, we find similar
evidence for infall in the spectra of point-like Lyman alpha emitters. The
presence of scattering by the infalling gas implies that the intrinsic Lya

onto point particles occurs from media that are turbulent rather than uniform.
In this paper, we give an approximate solution to the problem of a point
particle accreting from an ambient medium of supersonically turbulent gas.
Accretion in such media is bimodal, at some points resembling classical
Bondi-Hoyle flow, and in other cases being closer to the vorticity-dominated
accretion flows recently studied by Krumholz, McKee, & Klein. Based on this
observation, we develop a theoretical prediction for the accretion rate, and
confirm that our predictions are highly consistent with the results of
numerical simulations. The distribution of accretion rates is lognormal, and
the mean accretion rate in supersonically turbulent gas can be substantially
enhanced above the value that would be predicted by a naive application of the
Bondi-Hoyle formula. However, it can also be suppressed by the vorticity, just
as Krumholz, McKee, & Klein found for non-supersonic vorticity-dominated flows.
Magnetic fields, which we have not included in these models, may further
inhibit accretion. Our results have significant implications for a number
astrophysical problems, ranging from star formation to the black holes in
galactic centers. In particular, there are likely to be significant errors in
results that assume that accretion from turbulent media occurs at the
unmodified Bondi-Hoyle rate, or that are based on simulations that do not
resolve the Bondi-Hoyle radius of accreting objects.

computation of isochrones from evolutionary tracks; those related to atmosphere
models; those that are a consequence of the incompleteness of the input
ingredients; and those associated with the computational aspect used in
synthesis codes. We also discuss the issue of the inclusion of distributed
properties in synthesis models; as a paradigm of this case, we illustrate the
difficulties implied by the inclusion of tracks with rotation in synthesis
models. Finally, we describe several examples of the statistical approach to
population synthesis. We report on the failure of the fuel consumption theorem
(FCT) and the isochrone synthesis code to produce mutually consistent results.
However, we argue that FCT and isochrone synthesis results are reliable for
application to real systems in the wavelength range where they coincide. On the
constructive side, we derive several useful survival strategies to bypass
uncertainties. We show that single stellar populations at the turn-off ages of
the tabulated tracks can be safely compared, as they are scarcely affected by
the interpolation scheme used to compute isochrones. Finally, we suggest to use
derivative quantities, such as the SN-rate, as bug detectors. On the
recommendation side, we advocate for greater transparency and more
documentation in synthesis modeling. We also ask stellar model makers to think

  manuscript style",,,,"astro-ph",,"  There are now two dominant models of how stars form: gravitational collapse
theory holds that star-forming molecular clumps, typically hundreds to
thousands of solar masses in mass, fragment into gaseous cores that
subsequently collapse to make individual stars or small multiple systems. In
contrast, competitive accretion theory suggests that at birth all stars are
much smaller than the typical stellar mass (~0.5 solar masses), and that final
stellar masses are determined by the subsequent accretion of unbound gas from
the clump. Competitive accretion models explain brown dwarfs and free-floating
planets as protostars ejected from star-forming clumps before accreting much
mass, predicting that they should lack disks, have high velocity dispersions,
and form more frequently in denser clumps. They also predict that mean stellar
mass should vary within the Galaxy. Here we derive a simple estimate for the
rate of competitive accretion as a function of the star-forming environment,
based partly on simulations, and determine in what types of environments
competitive accretion can occur. We show that no observed star-forming region
produces significant competitive accretion, and that simulations that show
competitive accretion do so because their properties differ from those
determined by observation. Our result shows that stars form by gravitational
collapse, and explains why observations have failed to confirm predictions of
the competitive accretion scenario.

four fields in the gE galaxy M87. To a limit of m(FUV) = 25 we detect a total
of 66 globular clusters (GCs) in common with the deep HST optical-band study of
Kundu et al. (1999). Despite strong overlap in V- and I-band properties, the
M87 GCs have UV/optical properties that are distinct from clusters in the Milky
Way and in M31. M87 clusters, especially metal-poor ones, produce larger hot HB
populations than do Milky Way analogues. Cluster mass is probably not a factor
in these distinctions. The most metal-rich M87 GCs in our sample are near Z_sun
and overlap the local E galaxy sample in estimated Mg_2 line indices.
Nonetheless, the clusters produce much more UV light at a given Mg_2, being up
to 1 mag bluer than any gE galaxy in (FUV-V) color. The M87 GCs do not appear
to represent a transition between Milky Way-type clusters and E galaxies. The
differences are in the correct sense if the clusters are significantly older
than the E galaxies. Comparisons with Galactic open clusters indicate that the
hot stars lie on the extreme horizontal branch, rather than being blue
stragglers, and that the EHB becomes well populated for ages > 5 Gyr. We find
that 43 of our UV detections have no optical-band counterparts. Most appear to
be UV-bright background galaxies, seen through M87. Eleven NUV variable sources
detected at only one epoch in the central field are probably classical novae.

(CDM) caustic rings at cosmological distances may provide the tantalizing
opportunity to detect CDM indirectly, and discriminate between axions and
weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Caustics are places where the CDM
particles are naturally focussed. Our focus is upon the caustic rings which are
closed tubes whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic catastrophe with three
dual cusps. A caustic ring has a specific density profile, a specific geometry
and, therefore, precisely calculable gravitational lensing signatures. The
magnification monotonically increases as the line of sight approaches to the
cusps where it diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion. In this
limit, we find 37% magnification at a sample point near the outer cusps of the
CDM caustic rings at cosmological distances. In the presence of finite velocity
dispersion, the lower and upper bounds of the effective velocity dispersions of
the axion and WIMP flows in galactic halos may be used to constrain the lensing
effects at the cusps. For a cosmological axion caustic ring, we find that the
magnification may range between 3% and 2800% at the outer cusp, and between 2%
and 46% at the non-planer cusps. For a cosmological WIMP caustic ring, on the
other hand, we constrain the magnification between 3% and 28% at the outer
cusp, and between 2% and 5% at the non-planer cusps. The images of extended
sources may also show distortions that can be unambiguously attributed to
lensing by dark matter caustics. Finally, we derive the Catastrophe Function of
the triaxial caustic rings. We obtain the flow equations as the equilibrium
points of this Catastrophe Function. The analysis of the Stability (Hessian)
Matrix show that the caustic rings are structurally stable.

minimum mass of galaxies and hence a suppression of the cosmic star formation
rate. The affected population of dwarf galaxies included the progenitors of
massive galaxies that formed later. We show that a massive galaxy at a redshift
z >~ 6 should show a double-peaked star formation history marked by a clear
break. This break reflects the suppression signature from reionization of the
region in which the galaxy was assembled. Since massive galaxies originate in
overdense regions where cosmic evolution is accelerated, their environment
reionizes earlier than the rest of the universe. For a galaxy of ~ 1.e12
M_solar in stars at a redshift of z ~ 6.5, the star formation rate should
typically be suppressed at a redshift z >~ 10 since the rest of the universe is
known to have reionized by z >~ 6.5. Indeed, this is inferred to be the case
for HUDF-JD2, a massive galaxy which is potentially at z ~ 6.5 but is inferred

separation of these three groups in a relativistic Mach-number Lorentz-factor

disrupted after saturation. Those with a large Lorentz factor and large
relativistic Mach number are the stablest, due to the appearance of short
wavelength resonant modes which generate local mixing and heating in the shear
layer around a fast, unmixed core, giving a plausible solution for the problem
of the long-term stability of relativistic jets. A third group is present
between them, including jets with intermediate values of Lorentz factor and
relativistic Mach number, which are disrupted by a slow process of mixing
favored by an efficient and continuous conversion of kinetic into internal
energy. In the long term, all the models develop a distinct transversal
structure (shear/transition layers) as a consequence of KH perturbation growth,
depending on the class they belong to. The properties of these shear layers are

Telescope to image the core of the globular cluster M15 in the far-ultraviolet
(FUV) waveband. Based on these observations, we identify the FUV counterpart of
the recently discovered low-mass X-ray binary M15 X-2. Our time-resolved FUV
photometry shows a modulation with 0.062+/-0.004 mag semi-amplitude and we
clearly detect a period of 22.5806+/-0.0002 min. We have carried out extensive
Monte Carlo simulations which show that the signal is consistent with being
coherent over the entire observational time range of more than 3000 cycles.
This strongly suggests that it represents the orbital period of the binary
system. M15 X-2 is FUV bright (approx. 17 mag) and is characterized by an
extremely blue spectral energy distribution (F_lambda ~ lambda^{-2.0}). We also
find evidence for an excess of flux between 1500 and 1600 \AA and probably
between 1600 and 2000 \AA, which might be due to CIV 1550 and HeII 1640
emission lines. We also show that M15 X-2's X-ray luminosity can be powered by
accretion at the rate expected for gravitational-wave-driven mass transfer at
this binary period. The observed FUV emission appears to be dominated by an
irradiated accretion disk around the neutron star primary, and the variability
can be explained by irradiation of the low-mass white dwarf donor if the

We determined their distances, velocities, and metallicities to measure the
gravitational force law perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As in most
previous studies, we applied one-parameter models of the vertical gravitational
potential. We obtained a disk surface mass density within 1.1kpc of the
Galactic plane, Sigma_{1.1kpc}=64+/-5 Msun_pc^{-2}, with an excellent formal
accuracy, however we found that such one-parameter models can underestimate the
real uncertainties. Applying two-parameter models, we derived more realistic
estimates of the total surface mass density within 800pc from the Galactic
plane, Sigma_{0.8kpc}=57-66 Msun pc^{-2}, and within 1.1kpc,
Sigma{1.1kpc}=57-79 Msun pc^{-2}. This can be compared to literature estimates
of \sim40 Msun pc^{-2} in stars and to 13 Msun pc^{-2} in the less accurately
measured ISM contribution. We conclude that there is no evidence of large
amounts of dark matter in the disk and, furthermore, that the dark matter halo
is round or not vey much flattened.
  A by-product of this study is the determination of the half period of
oscillation by the Sun through the Galactic plane, 42+/-2Myr, which cannot be
related to the possible period of large terrestrial impact craters \sim

them to reach the main sequence while still accreting from their natal clouds.
The resulting nuclear burning produces a huge luminosity and a correspondingly
large radiation pressure force on dust grains in the accreting gas. This effect
may limit the upper mass of stars that can form by accretion. Indeed,
simulations and analytic calculations to date have been unable to resolve the
mystery of how stars of 50 solar masses and up form. We present two new ideas
to solve the radiation pressure problem. First, we use three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement simulations to study the
collapse of massive cores. We find that in three dimensions a configuration in
which radiation holds up an infalling envelope is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable,
leading radiation driven bubbles to collapse and accretion to continue. We also
present Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations showing that the cavities
created by protostellar winds provides a valve that allow radiation to escape
the accreting envelope, further reducing the ability of radiation pressure to
inhibit accretion.

610 MHz and cover a region of $\sim$1 square degree, with a sensitivity limit
of $1\sigma$ = 35 $\mu$Jy b$^{-1}$. The most relevant result of these
observations is the presence of a radio relic at the cluster periphery, at the
edge of a region where group infalling into the main cluster is taking place.
Thanks to the wealth of information available in the literature in the optical
and X-ray bands, a multi--band study of the relic and its surroundings was
performed. Our analysis is suggestive of a connection between this source and
the complex ongoing merger in the A521 region. The relic might be ``revived'
fossil radio plasma through adiabatic compression of the magnetic field or
shock re--acceleration due to the merger events. We also briefly discussed the
possibility that this source is the result of induced ram pressure stripping of
radio lobes associated with the nearby cluster radio galaxy J0454--1016a.
Allowing for the large uncertainties due to the small statistics, the number of
radio emitting early--type galaxies found in A521 is consistent with the
expectations from the standard radio luminosity function for local (z$\le$0.09)

Eclipse mapping of HT Cas is presented which shows changes in the structure of
the quiescent accretion disc. Observations in 2002 show the accretion disc to
be invisible except for the presence of a bright spot at the disc edge. 2003
observations, however, clearly show a bright inner disc and the bright spot to
be much fainter than in 2002. Although no outburst was associated with either
set of quiescent observations, the system was ~0.6 mJy brighter in 2003, mainly
due to the enhanced emission from the inner disc. We propose that these changes
are due to variations in the mass transfer rate from the secondary star and
through the disc. The disc colours indicate that it is optically thin in both

multiple frequencies suggests that 2050+364 may well be a one-sided core-jet
source, which appears as a double over a limited frequency range. One of the
dominant features, W, would then be the innermost visible portion of the jet,
and could be at or adjacent to the canonical radio core. The other, E, is
probably related to shocks at a sudden bend of the jet, towards extended
steep-spectrum region N. A remarkably deep and narrow HI absorption line
component extends over the entire projected extent of 2050+364. It coincides in
velocity with the [OIII] optical doublet lines to within 10 km/s. This HI
absorption could arise in the atomic cores of NLR clouds, and the motion in the
NLR is then remarkably coherent both along the line-of-sight and across a
projected distance of > 300 pc on the plane of the sky. Broader, shallower HI
absorption at lower velocities covers only the plausible core area W. This

keV band X-ray light curve can no longer be described by the exponential
density distribution model with which we successfully fitted the data between
1990 and 2003. Around day ~6200, we also find that the fractional contribution
to the observed soft X-ray flux from the decelerated shock begins to exceed
that of the fast shock and that the X-ray brightening becomes ""global"" rather
than ""spotty"". We interpret these results as evidence that the blast wave has
reached the main body of the dense circumstellar material all around the inner
ring. This interpretation is supported by other recent observations, including
a deceleration of the radial expansion of the X-ray remnant, a significant
up-turn in the mid-IR intensities, and the prevalence of the optical hot spots
around the entire inner ring, all of which occur at around day 6000. In
contrast to the soft X-ray light curve, the hard band (3-10 keV) X-ray light
curve increases at a much lower rate which is rather similar to the radio light
curve. The hard X-ray emission may thus originate from the reverse shock where
the radio emission is likely produced. Alternatively, the low increase rate of
the hard X-rays may simply be a result of the continuous softening of the
overall X-ray spectrum.

self-energy describes non-local dynamical correlations induced by short-ranged
collective SDW-like antiferromagnetic spin (or CDW-like charge) fluctuations.
At high enough temperatures these fluctuations can be viewed as a quenched
Gaussian random field with finite correlation length. This generalized
DMFT+Sigma_k approach is used for the numerical solution of the weakly doped
one-band Hubbard model with repulsive Coulomb interaction on a square lattice
with nearest and next nearest neighbour hopping. The effective single impurity
problem is solved by numerical renormalization group (NRG). Both types of
strongly correlated metals, namely (i) doped Mott insulator and (ii) the case
of bandwidth W<U (U - value of local Coulomb interaction) are considered.
Densities of states, spectral functions and ARPES spectra calculated within
DMFT+Sigma_k show a pseudogap formation near the Fermi level of the
quasiparticle band. We also briefly discuss effects of random impurity
scattering. Finally we demonstrate the qualitative picture of Fermi surface

constant between nearest neighbors. The so called Gutzwiller's term also
contributes to W^* away from the half filling; it is approximately proportional
to doping concentrations measured from the half filling. Magnetism is enhanced
by disorder because the renormalization of W^* by J is reduced by disorder. The
asymmetry of disorder between electron-doped and hole-doped cuprate oxide
superconductors must be, at least partly, responsible for that of
antiferromagnetic phases between them. The so called Kumagai phase is

system contains two types of Ni ions, which we call ""spine"" and ""cross-tie"".
Our neutron measurements can be described with the paramagnetic space group
Cmca for T < 15K and each observed magnetically ordered phase is characterized
by the appropriate irreducible representation(s). Our zero-field measurements
show that at T_PH=9.1K NVO undergoes a transition to an incommensurate order
which is dominated by a longitudinally-modulated structure with the spine spins
mainly parallel to the a-axis. Upon further cooling, a transition is induced at
T_HL=6.3K to an elliptically polarized incommensurate structure with both spine
and cross-tie moments in the a-b plane. At T_LC=4K the system undergoes a
first-order phase transition, below which the magnetic structure is a
commensurate antiferromagnet with the staggered magnetization primarily along
the a-axis and a weak ferromagnetic moment along the c-axis. A specific heat
peak at T_CC'=2.3K indicates an additional transition, which we were however
not able to relate to a change of the magnetic structure. Neutron, specific
heat, and magnetization measurements produce a comprehensive temperature-field
phase diagram. The symmetries of the two incommensurate magnetic phases are
consistent with the observation that only one phase has a spontaneous
ferroelectric polarization. All the observed magnetic structures are explained
theoretically using a simplified model Hamiltonian, involving competing
nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, spin anisotropy,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and pseudo-dipolar interactions.

perturbations of plane-symmetric anti-de Sitter black holes. The wave equations

time such that these black holes are stable against gravitational
perturbations. Our numerical results show that in the large (small) black hole
regime the frequencies of the ordinary quasinormal modes are proportional to
the horizon radius $r_{+}$ (wave number $k$). The frequency of the purely
damped mode is very close to the algebraically special frequency in the small
horizon limit, and goes as $ik^{2}/3r_{+}$ in the opposite limit. This result
is confirmed by an analytical method based on the power series expansion of the
frequency in terms of the horizon radius. The same procedure applied to the
Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter spacetime proves that the purely damped frequency
goes as $i(l-1)(l+2)/3r_{+}$, where $l$ is the quantum number characterizing
the angular distribution. Finally, we study the limit of high overtones and
find that the frequencies become evenly spaced in this regime. The spacing of
the frequency per unit horizon radius seems to be a universal quantity, in the
sense that it is independent of the wave number, perturbation parity and black
hole size.

report on a recent work on QCD Factorisation and Power Corrections in Charmless

that power corrections in charmless B decays are probably large, at least for

responsible for direct CP asymmetries in two-body charmless B decays are
related by CKM factors and SU(3) symmetry, we find that, if power corrections

were negligible, QCD Factorisation would predict the direct CP asymmetry of $B

exclusion principle (called `Dexclusion' principle), and also by a nonlocality
which is consistent with the spacetime uncertainty relation. The Dexclusion
principle is realized by composites of two operators, obeying the usual
canonical anticommutation relation and the Cuntz algebra, respectively. The
nonlocality appears as a consequence of a superselction rule associated with a

theory. The entropy of the so-called superstars, with multiple charges, which
have been proposed to be geometries corresponding to the condensation of giant

projective varieties, parallel to the idea of the polynomial hull in affine
varieties. With this concept, a generalization of J. Wermer's classical theorem
on the hull of a curve in $C^n$ is established in the projective setting. The
projective hull is shown to have interesting properties and is related to
various extremal functions and capacities in pluripotential theory. A main
analytic result asserts that for any point x in the projective hull K^ of a
compact set K in $P^n$, there exists a positive current T of bidimension (1,1)
with support in the closure of K^, and a probability measure $\mu$ on K with $d
d^cT=\mu- [x]$. This result generalizes to any Kahler manifold and has strong
consequences for the structure of K^. We also introduce the notion of a
projective spectrum for Banach graded algebras, parallel to the Gelfand
spectrum of a Banach algebra. This projective spectrum has universal properties
exactly like those in the Gelfand case. Moreover, the projective hull is shown
to play a role (for graded algebras) completely analogous to that played by the
polynomial hull in the study of finitely generated Banach algebras. This paper
gives foundations for generalizing many of the results on boundaries of
varieties in $C^n$ to general algebraic manifolds.

for models of differential or boolean type. We show here that a stronger
version of it holds in the differential setup when the decay of protein
concentrations is taken into account. This allows us to verify also the
validity of Thomas' rule in the context of piecewise-linear models and the
corresponding discrete models. We discuss open problems as well.

that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral genome. Viral
capsids are usually spherical, and for a significant number of viruses exhibit
overall icosahedral symmetry. The corresponding surface lattices, that encode
the locations of the capsid proteins and intersubunit bonds, can be modelled by
Viral Tiling Theory.
  It has been shown in vitro that under a variation of the experimental
boundary conditions, such as the pH value and salt concentration, tubular
particles may appear instead of, or in addition to, spherical ones. In order to
develop models that describe the simultaneous assembly of both spherical and
tubular variants, and hence study the possibility of triggering tubular
malformations as a means of interference with the replication mechanism, Viral
Tiling Theory has to be extended to include tubular lattices with end caps.
This is done here for the case of Papovaviridae, which play a distinguished
role from the viral structural point of view as they correspond to all pentamer
lattices, i.e. lattices formed from clusters of five protein subunits
throughout. These results pave the way for a generalisation of recently
developed assembly models.

By increasing the number of arms in the structure, multipartite entanglement is
obtained, as well as 1 to M cloning. Finally, we are considering configurations
that implement the symmetric splitting of an initial entangled state. All
calculations are carried out within the framework of the rotating wave
approximation in quantum optics, and our predictions could be tested with

offers the most important tool for describing symmetries in the system of

Pauli grading. The MAD-group corresponding to it is generated by generalized

quotient group is isomorphic to the Lie group $Sl(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)\times

control of that limit distribution are addressed by introducing a quantum
optical cavity in which a resonant Jaynes-Cummings type of interaction between
the quantum walk coin system realized in the form of a two-level atom and a
laser field is taking place. Driving the optical cavity by means of the
coin-field interaction time and the initial quantum coin state, we determine
two types of modification of the asymptotic behavior of the QRW. In the first
one the limit distribution is robustly reproduced up to a scaling, while in the
second one the quantum features of the walk, exemplified by enhanced diffusion
rate, are washed out and Gaussian asymptotics prevail. Verification of these
findings in an experimental setup that involves two quantum optical cavities
