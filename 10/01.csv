investigated up to z ~ 1. BHMFs at intermediate redshifts are calculated in two
ways. One way is from early-type galaxy luminosity functions (LFs); we assume
an M_BH - L_sph correlation at a redshift by considering a passive evolution of
L_sph in the local relationship. The resultant BHMFs (spheroid-BHMFs) from LFs
of red sequence galaxies indicates a slight decrease of number density with
increasing redshift at M_BH > 10^{7.5-8} M_solar. Since a redshift evolution in
slope and zeropoint of the M_BH - L_sph relation is unlikely to be capable of
making such an evolution in BHMF, the evolution of the spheroid-BHMFs is
perhaps due mainly to the decreasing normalization in the galaxy LFs. We also
investigate how spheroid-BHMFs are affected by uncertainties existing in the
derivation in detail. The other way of deriving a BHMF is based on the
continuity equation for number density of SMBHs and LFs of active galactic
nucleus (AGN). The resultant BHMFs (AGN-BHMFs) show no clear evolution out to z
= 1 at M_BH > 10^8 M_solar, but exhibit a significant decrease with redshift in
the lower mass range. Comparison of the spheroid-BHMFs with the AGN-BHMFs
suggests that at M_BH > 10^{8} M_solar, the spheroid-BHMFs are broadly
consistent with the AGN-BHMFs out to z ~ 1. The agreement between the
spheroid-BHMFs and the AGN-BHMFs appears to support that most of the SMBHs are
already hosted by massive spheroids at z ~ 1 and they evolve without
significant mass growth since then.

origin of the throughput variation by comparing the data with predictions from

small variations over the grating aperture in gelatin depth and/or refractive

homogeneity, isotropy and flatness of the universe appear as natural outcomes
and, in addition, fluctuations in the energy density are originated during the
inflationary phase. These seminal density fluctuations give rise to
fluctuations in the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at the
decoupling surface. Afterward, the CMB photons propagate almost freely, with
slight gravitational interactions with the evolving gravitational field present
in the large scale structure (LSS) of the matter distribution and a low
scattering rate with free electrons after the universe becomes reionized. These
secondary effects slightly change the shape of the intensity and polarization
angular power spectra (APS) of the radiation. The APS contain very valuable
information on the parameters characterizing the background model of the
universe and those parametrising the power spectra of both matter density
perturbations and gravitational waves. In the last few years data from
sensitive experiments have allowed a good determination of the shape of the
APS, providing for the first time a model of the universe very close to
spatially flat. In particular the WMAP first year data, together with other CMB
data at higher resolution and other cosmological data sets, have made possible
to determine the cosmological parameters with a precision of a few percent. The
most striking aspect of the derived model of the universe is the unknown nature
of most of its energy contents. This and other open problems in cosmology
represent exciting challenges for the CMB community. The future ESA Planck

instability. Using a restricted N-body model which allows for a survey of an
extended parameter space, we show that a passing dwarf star with a mass between
0.1 and 1 M_sun can probably induce gravitational instabilities in the
pre-planetary solar disk for prograde passages with minimum separations below
80-170 AU for isothermal or adiabatic disks. Inclined and retrograde encounters
lead to similar results but require slightly closer passages. Such encounter
distances are quite likely in young moderately massive star clusters (Scally &
Clarke 2001; Bonnell et al. 2001). The induced gravitational instabilities may
lead to enhanced planetesimal formation in the outer regions of the
protoplanetary disk, and could therefore be relevant for the existence of
Uranus and Neptune, whose formation timescale of about 100 Myr (Wuchterl,
Guillot & Lissauer 2000) is inconsistent with the disk lifetimes of about a few
Myr according to observational data by Haisch, Lada & Lada (2001). The
relatively small gas/solid ratio in Uranus and Neptune can be matched if the
perturbing fly-by occurred after early gas depletion of the solar system, i.e.
when the solar system was older than about 5 Myr.
  We also confirm earlier results by Heller (1993) that the observed 7 degree
tilt of the solar equatorial plane relative to the ecliptic plane could be the
consequence of such a close encounter.

favorable directions of pulsars' rotation and magnetic axes and extremely
fortuitous orientation of the orbit. In this system the millisecond pulsar A is
eclipsed once per orbit. During eclipse a clear modulation at the 2.77 s period
of pulsar B is seen, pointing unambiguously to magnetospheric origin of
eclipses. A simple geometric model, based on the idea that the radio pulses are
attenuated by synchrotron absorption on the closed magnetic field lines of
pulsar B, can successfully reproduces the eclipse light curves down to
intricate details. This detailed agreement confirms the dipolar structure of
the neutron star's magnetic field.
  The model gives clear predictions for temporal evolution of eclipse profile
due to geodetic precession of pulsar B.
  In addition, pulsar B shows orbital modulations of intensity, being
especially bright at two short orbital phases. We showed that these modulations
are due to distortion of pulsar B magnetosphere by pulsar A wind which produces
orbital phase-dependent changes of the direction along which radio waves are
emitted. Thus, pulsar B is intrinsically bright at all times but its radiation
beam misses the Earth at most orbital phases.

reveals a complex spectrum composed of soft X-ray emission due to
multi-temperature thermal plasma, and a hard continuum with strong emission
lines. The continuum is most likely a Compton reflection (reprocessing) of
primary emission that is completely absorbed at least up to 7 keV. The lines
can be identified with fluorescence from Si, S and Fe in the lowest ionization
stages. The equivalent widths of the Si and S lines are broadly compatible with
those anticipated for reprocessing by optically thick cold plasma of Solar
abundances, while the large equivalent width of the Fe line requires some
overabundance of iron. A contribution to the line from a transmitted component
cannot be ruled out, but the limits on the strength of the Compton shoulder
make it less likely. From the bolometric luminosity of the nuclear region, we
infer that the source radiates at 1 - 10% of its Eddington luminosity, for an
adopted central mass of 3 million Solar masses. The overall spectrum is
consistent with the hypotheses that the central engines powering the detected
megamsers in accretion disks are obscured from direct view by the associated

occurrence of megamaser emission and Compton-thick absorption columns. For the

from the protostellar envelope makes the protostellar disk unstable, leading to
spiral arms and the formation of dense protostellar/protoplanetary clumps
within them. The growing strength of spiral arms and ensuing redistribution of
mass and angular momentum creates a strong centrifugal disbalance in the disk
and triggers bursts of mass accretion during which the dense

box approximation. The turbulence is either driven by the magneto-rotational
instability or, in the non-magnetic case, by an explicit and artificial forcing
term in the momentum equation. Unlike the magnetic case, where most of the
dissipation occurs in the disc corona, in the forced hydrodynamic case most of
the dissipation occurs near the midplane. In the hydrodynamic case evidence is
presented for the stochastic excitation of epicycles. When the vertical and
radial epicyclic frequencies are different (modeling the properties around
rotating black holes), the beat frequency between these two frequencies appear
to show up as a peak in the temporal power spectrum in some cases. Finally, the
full turbulent resistivity tensor is determined and it is found that, if the
turbulence is driven by a forcing term, the signs of its off-diagonal
components are such that this effect would not be capable of dynamo action by
the shear--current effect.

and that those below the 'knee' (the rapid steepening in the energy spectrum)
at a few PeV come from Galactic supernovae, the particles being accelerated by
the shocks in the supernova remnants. At higher energies, there are problems in
that conventional SNR - which surely constitute the bulk of the sources - have
a natural limit at a few tens of PeV (for iron nuclei). The question of the
origin of particles above this limit is thus an open one. Here we examine a
number of possibilities: a variety of supernovae and hypernovae, pulsars, a
Giant Galactic Halo and an Extragalactic origin.
  A relevant property of any model is the extent to which it can provide the
lack of significant irregularity of the energy spectrum. Although it is
appreciated that spectral measurements are subject to systematic as well as
random errors we consider that contemporary data are good enough to allow at
least some progress in this field.
  In the search for origin above PeV energies we conclude that shocks in the
Galactic Halo, whatever their source (Galactic wind, relativistic plasmoids -
'cannonballs', multiple shocks from supernovae etc.) are most likely, pulsrs
such as B0656+14 and hypernovae come a close second although such a suggestion
is not without its difficulties. What is most important is that trapping of
particles in the Halo is needed to reduce irregularities of the energy spectra
both below and above the 'knee' caused by the stochastic nature of supernova
explosions and other potential (discrete) Galactic sources.
  We argue that precise experimental studies of spectral 'irregularities' will
provide considerable help in the search for cosmic ray origin.

quantum tunneling in complex multi-atomic two-level systems. Two distinct
regimes of strong and weak interactions are found. The regimes depend on the
relationship between a characteristic energy of the nuclear quadrupole
interaction $\lambda_{\ast}$ and a bare tunneling coupling strength
$\Delta_{0}$. When $\Delta_{0}>\lambda_{\ast}$, the internal interaction is
negligible and tunneling remains coherent determined by $\Delta_{0}$. When
$\Delta_{0}<\lambda_{\ast}$, coherent tunneling breaks down and an effective
tunneling amplitude decreases by an exponentially small overlap factor
$\eta^{\ast}\ll1$ between internal ground states of left and right wells of a
tunneling system. This affects thermal and kinetic properties of tunneling
systems at low temperatures $T<\lambda_{*}$. The theory is applied for
interpreting the anomalous behavior of the resonant dielectric susceptibility
in amorphous solids at low temperatures $T\leq 5$mK where the nuclear
quadrupole interaction breaks down coherent tunneling. We suggest the
experiments with external magnetic fields to test our predictions and to
clarify the internal structure of tunneling systems in amorphous solids.

The short segments then start to co-rotate with the applied field although they
lag behind by approximately $10^\circ$. Very interestingly, if the rotation is

sandpiles) may undergo phase transitions between active and absorbing states.
We generalize the Manna sandpile model with fixed number of particles,
introducing a parameter $-1 \leq \lambda \leq 1$ related to the toppling of
particles from active sites to its first neighbors. In particular, we discuss a
model with height restrictions, allowing for at most two particles on a site.
Sites with double occupancy are active, and their particles may be transfered
to first neighbor sites, if the height restriction do allow the change. For
$\lambda=0$ each one of the two particles is independently assigned to one of
the two first neighbors and the original stochastic sandpile model is
recovered. For $\lambda=1$ exactly one particle will be placed on each first
neighbor and thus a deterministic (BTW) sandpile model is obtained. When
$\lambda=-1$ two particles are moved to one of the first neighbors, and this
implies that the density of active sites is conserved in the evolution of the
system, and no phase transition is observed. Through simulations of the
stationary state, we estimate the critical density of particles and the
critical exponents as functions of $\lambda$.

mass, which are both in excellent agreement to experimental data. However, the
electronic effect due to the e2g- band flattening near the Gamma-point due to
Nb-doping up to 0.2 at% is the main factor for the increase of effective mass.
Doping of La shows a linear decrease of the effective mass; this is explained
by the different surrounding of A- and B-site. Substitution of other elements
like Ba on the A-site and V on the B-site in SrTiO3 were also found to increase
the effective mass.

  Networks","full paper",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We explore the SNR-optimal relay functionality in a \emph{memoryless} relay
network, i.e. a network where, during each channel use, the signal transmitted
by a relay depends only on the last received symbol at that relay. We develop a
generalized notion of SNR for the class of memoryless relay functions. The
solution to the generalized SNR optimization problem leads to the novel concept
of minimum mean square uncorrelated error estimation(MMSUEE). For the elemental
case of a single relay, we show that MMSUEE is the SNR-optimal memoryless relay
function regardless of the source and relay transmit power, and the modulation
scheme. This scheme, that we call estimate and forward (EF), is also shown to
be SNR-optimal with PSK modulation in a parallel relay network. We demonstrate
that EF performs better than the best of amplify and forward (AF) and
demodulate and forward (DF), in both parallel and serial relay networks. We
also determine that AF is near-optimal at low transmit power in a parallel
network, while DF is near-optimal at high transmit power in a serial network.
For hybrid networks that contain both serial and parallel elements, and when
robust performance is desired, the advantage of EF over the best of AF and DF
is found to be significant. Error probabilities are provided to substantiate
the performance gain obtained through SNR optimality. We also show that, for
\emph{Gaussian} inputs, AF, DF and EF become identical.

the second a generalization of the affinely parametrized quadratic action for a
relativistic particle. Expressions for a conserved 4-momentum and angular
momentum tensor are obtained in terms of the particles' trajectories in this
post-Minkowski approximation. A formal solution to the equations of motion is
found for a binary system with circular orbits. For a bound system of this

accurate to first post-Newtonian order, by adding to the post-Minkowski action
a term cubic in the particle masses. Curiously, the conserved energy and

well-defined for this bound 2-particle system despite the fact that the total
energy and angular momentum of the radiation field diverge. Corresponding

preheating mechanism is the fact that the reheating temperature is proportional
to the mass of the decayed particle, {\it the right-handed sneutrino}, $T_R

together with the non-minimal coupling constant of Dirac spinors provides the
measure for parity violating spin-spin interaction terms in the effective field
theory. For complex values of the Immirzi parameter, the resulting effective
field theory yields complex values for the torsion, and a non-unitary effective
field theory that blows up for the special cases $\gamma=\pm i$ where the
gravitational kinetic term is the Ashtekar action. We show that by restricting
ourselves to real values for the torsion, there is a natural set of choice for
the non-minimal coupling constant that yields real and unitary effective field
theory that does not blow up for the special cases $\gamma=\pm i$. We then show
that these particular values for the non-minimal coupling coefficients most

"math/0510009","Islam Hussein","Islam I. Hussein and Anthony M. Bloch","Optimal Control of Underactuated Nonholonomic Mechanical Systems","8 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.OC",,"  In this paper we use an affine connection formulation to study an optimal
control problem for a class of nonholonomic, under-actuated mechanical systems.
In particular, we aim at minimizing the norm-squared of the control input to
move the system from an initial to a terminal state. We consider systems
evolving on general manifolds. The class of nonholonomic systems we study in
this paper includes, in particular, wheeled-type vehicles, which are important
for many robotic locomotion systems. The two special aspects of this optimal
control problem are the nonholonomic constraints and under-actuation.
Nonholonomic constraints restrict the evolution of the system to a distribution
on the manifold. The nonholonomic connection is used to express the constrained
equations of motion. Furthermore, it is used to take variations of the cost
functional. Many robotic systems are under-actuated since control inputs are
usually applied through the robot's internal configuration space only. While we
do not consider symmetries with respect to group actions in this paper, the
fact that the system is under-actuated is taken into account in our problem
formulation. This allows one to compute reaction forces due to any inputs
applied in directions orthogonal to the constraint distribution. We illustrate
our ideas by considering a simple example on a three-dimensional manifold.

withdrawal to viscous entrainment. In our model problem, an interface between
two immiscible layers of equal viscosity is deformed by an axisymmetric
withdrawal flow, which is driven by a point sink located some distance above
the interface in the upper layer. We find that steady-state hump solutions,
corresponding to selective withdrawal of liquid from the upper layer, cease to
exist above a threshold withdrawal flux, and that this transition corresponds
to a saddle-node bifurcation for the hump solutions. Numerical results on the
shape evolution of the steady-state interface are compared against previous
experimental measurements. We find good agreement where the data overlap.
However, the numerical results' larger dynamic range allows us to show that the
large increase in the curvature of the hump tip near transition is not
consistent with an approach towards a power-law cusp shape, an interpretation
previously suggested from inspection of the experimental measurements alone.
Instead the large increase in the curvature at the hump tip reflects a
logarithmic coupling between the overall height of the hump and the curvature
at the tip of the hump.

important role both in the short term and in the long term dynamics of epidemic
spread. We have studied the effect of the network structure on models of immune
for life diseases and found that in addition to the reduction of the effective

may strongly enhance the stochastic fluctuations. As a consequence, time series
of unforced Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models provide
patterns of recurrent epidemics with realistic amplitudes, suggesting that

gained each time the bacteria reproduces decreases rapidly, and investing
resources to survive to reproduce the first few times is likely more
advantageous than investing additional resources to try to maintain cell

Mutations in p53 gene are associated with many cancers. In response to signals
such as DNA damage, p53 controls the transcription of a series of genes that
cause cell cycle arrest during which DNA damage is repaired, or triggers
programmed cell death that eliminates possibly cancerous cells wherein DNA
damage might have remained unrepaired. Previous experiments showed oscillations
in p53 level in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism of oscillation
remained unclear. Here we examine a model where the concentrations of p53
isoforms are regulated by Mdm22, Arf, Siah, and beta-catenin. The extent of DNA
damage is signalled through the switch-like activity of a DNA damage sensor,
the DNA-dependent protein kinase Atm. This switch is responsible for initiating
and terminating oscillations in p53 concentration. The strength of the DNA
damage signal modulates the number of oscillatory waves of p53 and Mdm22 but
not the frequency or amplitude of oscillations{a result that recapitulates
experimental findings. A critical fnding was that the phosphorylated form of
Nbs11, a member of the DNA break repair complex Mre11-Rad50-Nbs11 (MRN), must
augment the activity of Atm kinase. While there is in vitro support for this
assumption, this activity appears essential for p53 dynamics. The model
provides several predictions concerning, among others, degradation of the
phosphorylated form of p53, the rate of DNA repair as a function of DNA damage,
the sensitivity of p53 oscillation to transcription rates of SIAH, beta-CATENIN

using one-way LOCC, where a measurement is made first on the 3-dimensional part
and the result used to select an optimal measurement on the n-dimensional part.
This conjecture has implications for the LOCC-assisted capacity of certain
quantum channels, where coordinated measurements are made on the system and
environment. By measuring first in the environment, the conjecture would imply
that the environment-assisted classical capacity of any rank three channel is
at least log 3. Similarly by measuring first on the system side, the conjecture
would imply that the environment-assisting classical capacity of any qutrit
channel is log 3. We also show that one-way LOCC is not symmetric, by providing
an example of a qutrit channel whose environment-assisted classical capacity is
less than log 3.
