take the gas off the plane. We show that magnetically generated warps are
clearly flawed because they would wrap up into a spiral in less than two or
three galactic rotations. The inclusion of any magnetic diffusivity to dilute
the wrapping effect, causes the amplitude of the warp to damp. We also consider
observational consequences of the accretion of an intergalactic plane-parallel
flow at infinity. We have computed the amplitude and warp asymmetry in the
accretion model, for a disc embedded in a flattened dark matter halo, including
self-consistently the contribution of the modes with azimuthal wavenumbers m=0
and m=1. This model predicts quite asymmetric warps, maximum gas displacements
on the two sides in the ratio 3:2 for the preferred Galactic parameters,and the
presence of a fraction ~3.5% of U-shaped warps, at least. The azimuthal
dependence of the moment transfer by the ram pressure would produce a strong
asymmetry in the thickness of the HI layer and asymmetric density distributions
in z, in conflict with observational data for the warp in our Galaxy and in
external galaxies. The amount of accretion that is required to explain the
Galactic warp would give gas scaleheights in the far outer disc that are too
small. We conclude that accretion of a flow with no net angular momentum,
cannot be the main and only cause of warps.

generally observed to be perpendicular to the disk major axis. The FR I radio
source 3C 449 is an outlier to this statistical majority, as it possesses a
nearly parallel jet/disk orientation on the sky. We examine the 600 pc dusty
disk in this galaxy with images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that a
colormap of the disk exhibits a twist in its isocolor contours (isochromes). We
model the colormap by integrating galactic starlight through an absorptive
disk, and find that the anomalous twist in the isochromes can be reproduced in
the model with a vertically thin, warped disk. The model predicts that the disk
is nearly perpendicular to the jet axis within 100 pc of the nucleus. We
discuss physical mechanisms capable of causing such a warp. We show that
precessional models or a torque on the disk arising from a possible binary
black hole in the AGN causes precession on a timescale that is too long to
account for the predicted disk morphology. However, we estimate that the
pressure in the X-ray emitting interstellar medium is large enough to perturb
the disk, and argue that jet-driven anisotropy in the excited ISM may be the
cause of the warp. In this way, the warped disk in 3C 449 may be a new
manifestation of feedback from an active galactic nucleus.

the WD's effective temperature, Teff, using the optical continuum for a number
of observed binaries, and show that it agrees well with our theoretical
calculations. Driven by gravitational radiation losses, the time averaged
accretion rate, <Mdot>, decreases monotonically with increasing Porb, covering
six orders of magnitude. If the short period (Porb<10 min) systems accrete at a
rate consistent with gravitational radiation via direct impact, we predict
their unpulsed optical/UV light to be that of the Teff>50,000$ K accreting WD.
At longer Porb we calculate the Teff and absolute visual magnitude, M_V, that
the accreting WD will have during low accretion states, and find that the WD
naturally crosses the pulsational instability strip. Discovery and study of
pulsations could allow for the measurement of the accumulated helium mass on
the accreting WD, as well as its rotation rate. Accretion heats the WD core,

plummets. For the two long period AM CVn binaries with measured parallaxes, GP
Com and CE 315, we show that the optical broadband colors and intensity are

important role in Galactic dynamics and cosmology, where its successful
reproduction is a key test of simulations of galaxy halo formation. Here, we
examine its representative nature by conducting an analysis of the
3-dimensional spatial distribution of the M31 subgroup of galaxies. We begin by
a discussion of distance estimates and incompleteness concerns, before
revisiting the question of membership of the M31 subgroup. Comparison of the
distribution of M31 and Galactic satellites relative to the galactic disks
suggests that the Galactic system is probably modestly incomplete at low
latitudes by ~20%. We find that the radial distribution of satellites around
M31 is more extended than the Galactic subgroup; 50% of the Galactic satellites
are found within ~100kpc of the Galaxy, compared to ~200kpc for M31. We search
for ``ghostly streams'' of satellites around M31, in the same way others have
done for the Galaxy, and find several. The lack of M31-centric kinematic data,
however, means we are unable to probe whether these streams represent real
physical associations. Finally, we find that the M31 satellites are
asymmetrically distributed with respect to our line-of-sight to this object, so
that the majority of its satellites are on its near side with respect to our
line-of-sight. We quantify this result and find it to be significant at the ~3
sigma level. Until such time as a satisfactory explanation for this finding is
presented, our results warn against treating the M31 subgroup as complete,
unbiased and relaxed.

high coronal density, and the other with a stronger stellar field and a lower

field lines carry significant angular momentum out of the star. However, this

knots. The transverse jet profile reveals that the extended emission has the
intensity peak at the jet boundaries. We note that limb-brightened jet
morphologies have been observed previously at radio frequencies in some jet
sources, but never so clearly at higher photon energies. Our result therefore
supports a stratified jet model, consisting of a relativistic outflow including
a boundary layer with a velocity shear. In addition, we found that the X-ray
spectrum of the diffuse component is almost uniform across and along the jet.
We discuss this spectral behavior within a framework of shock and stochastic
particle acceleration processes. We note some evidence for a possible spectral
hardening at the outer sheath of the jet. Due to the limited photon statistics

determine the reality of this finding, however we note that the existence of

investigated the resulting implications for testing theoretical evolutionary
models with the data reported by Close and coworkers for the low-mass companion
AB Dor C. Using color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the AB Dor moving group
is roughly coeval with the Pleiades (100-125 Myr) and is clearly older than IC
2391 (35-50 Myr). In fact, based on a comparison of the kinematics of AB Dor
and the Pleiades, we suggest that the stars identified by Zuckerman and
coworkers as members of a moving group with AB Dor are remnants of the large
scale star-formation event that formed the Pleiades. Using the age of 50+50/-20
Myr adopted by Close, the luminosity predicted by the models of Chabrier and
Baraffe for AB Dor C is larger than the value reported by Close, but is still
within the quoted uncertainties. Meanwhile, the agreement is good when our age
estimate for AB Dor C is adopted. Thus, we find no evidence in the data
presented by Close for AB Dor C to suggest that previous studies using the
models of Chabrier and Baraffe and bolometric luminosity as the mass indicator
have significantly underestimated the masses of young low-mass stars and brown

consistent with the value that we estimate. We measure a spectral type of
M6+/-1 from the K-band spectrum of AB Dor C, which is earlier than the value of
M8+/-1 from Close and is consistent with the model predictions when a dwarf
temperature scale is adopted. In a test of these models at much younger ages,
we show that the low-mass IMFs that they produce for star-forming regions are
similar to the IMF of the solar neighborhood. If the masses of the low-mass

below liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) question the classical approach to the

diffusion constant tends to a nearly temperature-independent value rather than
continuing its activated trend. The low temperature branch is apparently
characteristic of a quantum mechanical process dominated by tunneling in ground
state. Concommitantly, we apply an occurrence probability approach to
describing the overall temperature dependence as a single continuous rate.
Within the adiabatic approximation the electronic eigenvalue depending
parametrically on the nuclear coordinates is taken to be the potential energy
to control the motion of the nuclei. The resulting rate involves all
horizontal-tunneling energy-conserving elastic transitions at the quantized
energy levels of the migrating atom. A small though not negligible slope of in
the temperature dependence as the temperature is raised below 100 K is dealt
with by complementing for the rate of a parallel one-phonon inelastic tunneling
process in excess to the basic elastic-tunneling rate. Our combined approach
agrees well with the experimental data. In particular, the frequency of the

frequency from inelastic neutron-scattering data. The migrational barrier is

useful, when dealing with the low-energy effects of the long-range Coulomb

orientations with path constraints, and discuss its use in the solution of the
vertex coloring problem and some versions of the frequency assignment problem.
A study of the polytope associated with the formulation is presented, including
proofs of which constraints of the formulation are facet-defining and the

The protocol has been designed to meet specialized requirements of ad-hoc
networks, such as lack of direct communication between nodes or requirements
for revocable anonymity. At the same time, a ad-hoc authentication protocol
must be resistant to spoofing, eavesdropping and playback, and
man-in-the-middle attacks. The article analyzes existing authentication methods
based on the Public Key Infrastructure, and finds that they have several
drawbacks in ad-hoc networks. Therefore, a new authentication protocol, basing
on established cryptographic primitives (Merkle's puzzles and zero-knowledge
proofs) is proposed. The protocol is studied for a model ad-hoc chat
application that provides private conversations.

perfect for higher moments ($n\geq 2$) and not too large $x_0$ ($x_0\leq 0.1$),

the truncated moments method increases for larger $M$ and decreases very slowly

quark density. Under the electric and color neutrality conditions there appear
various phases as a result of the Fermi surface mismatch among different quark
flavors induced by finite strange quark mass; the color-flavor locked (CFL)
phase where quarks are all energy gapped, the u-quark superconducting (uSC)
phase where u-quarks are paired with either d- or s-quarks, the d-quark
superconducting (dSC) phase that is the d-quark analogue of the uSC phase, the
two-flavor superconducting (2SC) phase where u- and d-quarks are paired, and
the unpaired quark matter (UQM) that is normal quark matter without pairing.
Besides these possibilities, when the Fermi surface mismatch is large enough to
surpass the gap energy, the gapless superconducting phases are expected. We
focus our discussion on the chromomagnetic instability problem related to the
gapless CFL (gCFL) onset and explore the instability regions on the phase
diagram as a function of the temperature and the quark chemical potential. We
sketch how to reach stable physical states inside the instability regions.

contribution to the axion-gluon coupling that appears below the scale of
supersymmetry breaking when gluinos are integrated out. In particular there is
a point of enhanced symmetry in parameter space where the axion mass is

chain technique, but rather are inspired by developments in statistical physics
in connection with correlation decay properties of Gibbs measures and its
implications to uniqueness of Gibbs measures on infinite trees, reconstruction
problems and local weak convergence methods.
  On a negative side, our algorithms provide $\epsilon$-approximations only to
the logarithms of the size of a feasible set (also known as free energy in
statistical physics). But on the positive side, our approach provides
deterministic as opposed to probabilistic guarantee on approximations.
Moreover, for some regular graphs we obtain explicit values for the counting
problem. For example, we show that every 4-regular $n$-node graph with large
girth has approximately $(1.494...)^n$ independent sets, and in every
$r$-regular graph with $n$ nodes and large girth the number of $q\geq
r+1$-proper colorings is approximately $[q(1-{1\over q})^{r\over 2}]^n$, for
large $n$. In statistical physics terminology, we compute explicitly the limit
of the log-partition function. We extend our results to random regular graphs.

  Riemann Mapping Theorem",,,,,"math.DS math.CV",,"  The boundary of the Siegel disk of a quadratic polynomial with an
irrationally indifferent fixed point with the golden mean rotation number has
been observed to be self-similar. The geometry of this self-similarity is
universal for a large class of holomorphic maps. A renormalization explanation
of this universality has been proposed in the literature. However, one of the
ingredients of this explanation, the hyperbolicity of renormalization, has not
been proved yet.
  The present work considers a cylinder renormalization - a novel type of
renormalization for holomorphic maps with a Siegel disk which is better suited
for a hyperbolicity proof. A key element of a cylinder renormalization of a
holomorphic map is a conformal isomorphism of a dynamical quotient of a subset
of $\field{C}$ to a bi-infinite cylinder $\field{C} / \field{Z}$. A
construction of this conformal isomorphism is an implicit procedure which can
be performed using the Measurable Riemann Mapping Theorem.
  We present a constructive proof of the Measurable Riemann Mapping Theorem,
and obtain rigorous bounds on a numerical approximation of the desired
conformal isomorphism. Such control of the uniformizing conformal coordinate is
of key importance for a rigorous computer-assisted study of cylinder
renormalization.

state (EOS) to relate the thermodynamic variables of density, internal energy,
temperature, and pressure. A valid EOS must satisfy the thermodynamic
conditions of consistency (derivation from a free energy) and stability
(positive sound speed squared). When phase transitions are significant, the EOS
is complicated and can only be specified in a table. For tabular EOS's such as
SESAME from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the consistency and stability
conditions take the form of a differential equation relating the derivatives of
pressure and energy as functions of temperature and density, along with
positivity constraints. Typical software interfaces to such tables based on
polynomial or rational interpolants compute derivatives of pressure and energy
and may enforce the stability conditions, but do not enforce the consistency
condition and its derivatives. We describe a new type of table interface based
on a constrained local least squares regression technique. It is applied to
several SESAME EOS's showing how the consistency condition can be satisfied to
round-off while computing first and second derivatives with demonstrated
second-order convergence. An improvement of 14 orders of magnitude over
conventional derivatives is demonstrated, although the new method is apparently
two orders of magnitude slower, due to the fact that every evaluation requires
solving an 11-dimensional nonlinear system.
