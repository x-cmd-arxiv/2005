Firstly, the universe is
rational and the rationality is the proportional density distribution in any
independent galaxy. Proportion means that the density distribution of stars is
orderly. For example, there are four giants standing in array. Their heights
are A, B, C, D, respectively, and A, B stand in the first row from left to
right, C, D in the second row from left to right. Proportion requires that A
divided by C be equal to B divided by D. Rational structures are smooth 2- (or
3-) dimensional structures, which are either circularly (spherically) symmetric
with respect to the center point, or bilaterally symmetric. Secondly, spiral
galaxy arms are linearly shaped, which are neither circularly symmetric nor
bilaterally symmetric. Therefore, arms are not rational structures. Arm
patterns exist only in spiral galaxies and they are weak compared with the main
disk structure. Therefore, the presence of arm structure is the disturbance to
the rational structure. Because arm patterns exist only in spiral galaxies and
only spiral galaxies present dust, I come to the critical answer to the above
question: any disturbance to rational structure produces cosmic dust. From now
on we call the disturbance to rational structure the cosmic impulse. Therefore,
the universe is originated not only rationally but also impulsively.

exhibited multiple 25-150 Hz oscillations. Frequencies in this range are
expected for toroidal shear waves in a neutron star (NS) crust, lending support
to Duncan's proposal that such modes may be excited in these events. This
motivates a reassessment of how these waves reflect the NS structure and what
role the magnetic field plays in setting their frequencies. We calculate the
eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of toroidal oscillations for a realistic NS
crust, including a vertical magnetic field at magnetar strengths
($B\sim10^{14}-10^{15} {\rm G}$). The lowest radial-order mode has a
red-shifted frequency of $\approx28 {\rm Hz}[l(l+1)/6]^{1/2}$, with the
prefactor depending on the NS's mass and radius, and its crust's depth and
composition. This mode is independent of the magnetic field for
$B\lesssim4\times10^{15} {\rm G}$, a limit much greater than the inferred
dipole magnetic fields for these objects. Though this is a good fit to the
observed oscillations, only rather loose constraints can be made for the NSs'
properties because all that can be fit is this prefactor (a single parameter).
Modes with shorter radial wavelengths are more sensitive to the magnetic field
starting at $B\sim2\times10^{14} {\rm G}$ and have higher frequencies (600-2000
Hz). The discovery of these modes, coupled with the oscillations observed thus
far, would provide a powerful probe to the NS crustal structure.

properties of SDSS 0423-0414, including its overluminosity and high effective
temperature compared to other early-type T dwarfs, and possibly its conflicting
spectral classifications (L7.5 in the optical, T0 in the near infrared). The
relatively short estimated orbital period of this system (~15-20 yr) and the

are accompanied by a supernovae (types II or Ib or Ic). Typical progenitors
are, therefore, larger than $\sim 2.1 \Ms$. We suggest \cite{PS04,PS05} that
the binary pulsar J0737-3039 provides evidence for a new formation channel:
collapse of a light progenitor. This binary pulsar J0737-3039 has several
remarkable features including among others: a very tight orbit with a Keplerian
velocity of ~600km/sec, a low eccentricity, and a location ~50pc from the
Galactic plane implying that the system has, at high likelihood, a small
(compared to Keplerian) center of mass velocity. A significant mass loss during
the formation of the second pulsar would have lead either to an eccentric orbit
or to a large center of mass velocity or to both. Therefore, we can set a
strong upper limit on the progenitor's mass. A progenitor more massive than
1.9$\Ms$ is ruled out (at 97% confidence). The kinematically favored option is
of a progenitor mass around 1.45$\Ms$. Recent evidence for a rather low
velocity proper motion supports this prediction and decreases the likelihood of
the standard (high mass progenitor) scenario. Lack of variations in the pulses'
profiles (which indicate no significant geodetic precession) provides further
support for the no kick and low progenitor mass formation scenario.

variations in these clusters. While existing models fail to reproduce all the

of AGB stars produce the observed abundances. A first generation of metal-poor
AGB stars pollutes the entire cluster and is responsible for the large ratios
of 25Mg/24Mg and 26Mg/24Mg observed in cluster stars with compositions
identical to field stars at the same metallicity. Differing degrees of
pollution by a second generation of AGB stars of the same metallicity as the

successfully detect a terrestrial planet angularly close to its parent star:
photon noise from diffracted star light, and speckle noise from star light
scattered by instrumentally-generated wavefront perturbation. Coronagraphs
tackle only the photon noise contribution by reducing diffracted star light at
the location of a planet. Speckle noise should be addressed with
adaptative-optics systems. Following the tracks of Malbet, Yu and Shao (1995),
we develop in this paper two analytical methods for wavefront sensing and
control that aims at creating dark holes, i.e. areas of the image plane cleared
out of speckles, assuming an ideal coronagraph and small aberrations. The first
method, speckle field nulling, is a fast FFT-based algorithm that requires the
deformable-mirror influence functions to have identical shapes. The second
method, speckle energy minimization, is more general and provides the optimal
deformable mirror shape via matrix inversion. With a NxN deformable mirror, the
size of matrix to be inverted is either N^2xN^2 in the general case, or only
NxN if influence functions can be written as the tensor product of two
one-dimensional functions. Moreover, speckle energy minimization makes it
possible to trade off some of the dark hole area against an improved contrast.
For both methods, complex wavefront aberrations (amplitude and phase) are
measured using just three images taken with the science camera (no dedicated
wavefront sensing channel is used), therefore there are no non-common path
errors. We assess the theoretical performance of both methods with numerical
simulations, and find that these speckle nulling techniques should be able to
improve the contrast by several orders of magnitude.

We clearly detect bimodality in the GC colour distribution of NGC 1407. The
blue GC subpopulation has a mean colour of B-I = 1.61 and a relative
contribution of around 40%, whereas the red subpopulation with B-I = 2.06

to [Fe/H] = -1.45 and -0.19. Both subpopulations are intrinsically broad in
colour (indicating a range in ages and/or metallicities), with the red
subpopulation being broader than the blue. The GC colour distribution for NGC
1400 is less clear cut than for NGC 1407, however, we also find evidence for a
bimodal distribution. We find the NGC 1407 red GCs to be 20% smaller in size
than the blue ones. We find both GC systems to possess a GC surface density
distribution which is largely constant in these inner galaxy regions. We fit
isothermal-like profiles and derive GC system core radii of 9.4 kpc for NGC

for NGC 1400. A fit to the GC luminosity function gives a distance modulus of
31.6, which is in good agreement with distances based on the Faber-Jackson

show that this new method of mapping interstellar clouds is within the

resolution of up to ~ 0.1 arcsec. This opens new perspectives in the study of
interstellar dust and gas structure on very small scales. The validity of the

framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). The assumption
of meridional self-similarity is adopted for the construction of
semi-analytical solutions of the GRMHD equations describing outflows close to
the polar axis. In addition, it is assumed that relativistic effects related to
the rotation of the black hole and the plasma are negligible compared to the
gravitational and other energetic terms. The constructed model allows us to
extend previous MHD studies for coronal winds from young stars to spine jets
from Active Galactic Nuclei surrounded by disk-driven outflows. The outflows
are thermally driven and magnetically or thermally collimated. The collimation
depends critically on an energetic integral measuring the efficiency of the
magnetic rotator, similarly to the non relativistic case. It is also shown that
relativistic effects affect quantitatively the depth of the gravitational well
and the coronal temperature distribution in the launching region of the
outflow. Similarly to previous analytical and numerical studies, relativistic
effects tend to increase the efficiency of the thermal driving but reduce the
effect of magnetic self-collimation.

colour-magnitude relations and the [<Mg/Fe>_V]-sigma relation observed in
ellipticals, we conclude that either bursts involving a gas mass comparable to
the mass already transformed into stars during the first episode of star
formation and occurring at any redshift, or bursts occurring at low redshift
(i.e. z<0.2) and with a large range of accreted mass, are ruled out. These
models fail in matching the above relations even if the initial infall
hypothesis is relaxed, and the galaxies form either by means of more
complicated star formation histories or by means of the classical monolithic
model. On the other hand, galaxies accreting a small amount of gas at high
redshift (i.e. z>3) produce a spread in the model results, with respect to
Paper I best model, which is consistent with the observational scatter of the
color-magnitude relations, although there is only marginal agreement with the

binary systems, implying a close (a<2.6 au) binary frequency of 17-30 per cent
and overall frequency of 32-45 per cent. N-body models of the dynamical decay
of unstable protostellar multiple systems are excluded with high confidence
because they do not produce enough close binary VLMs/BDs. The large number of
close binaries and high overall binary frequency are also completely
inconsistent with published smoothed particle hydrodynamical modelling and
argue against a dynamical origin for VLMs/BDs.

orientation in different directions, all of which indicates that RBS797
represents a very peculiar case. The lowest resolution images show large-scale
radio emission characterized by amorphous morphology and a steep spectrum,
extended on a scale of hundreds of kpc. On a scale of tens of kpc, there is
evidence of 1.4 GHz radio emission elongated in the northeast-southwest
direction exactly towards the holes detected in X-rays. The highest resolution

they are remarkably oriented in a direction that is perpendicular to that of
the extended structure detected at a lower resolution. We therefore find
evidence of a strong interaction between the central radio source and the
intra-cluster medium in RBS797. We suggest a scenario in which the 1.4 GHz
emission filling the X-ray cavities consists of buoyant bubbles of radio
emitting plasma that are created by twin jets in the past and whose expansion
has displaced the thermal gas that was formerly in the X-ray holes, whereas the
two jets visible at 4.8 GHz are related to the present nuclear activity that
has restarted at a different position angle from the original outburst that
created the outer radio lobes. The total radio luminosity is ~ 10^42 erg/s,

issues associated with attempting to realize asymptotic statistics results with

ill-suited for a continuum description. However, smooth granular flows have
been shown to occur in specific geometries such as linear shear in the absence
of gravity, slow inclined plane flows and, recently, flows in split-bottom
Couette geometries. The wide shear regions in these systems should be amenable
to a continuum description, and the theoretical challenge lies in finding
constitutive relations between the internal stresses and the flow field. We
propose a set of testable constitutive assumptions, including
rate-independence, and investigate the additional restrictions on the
constitutive relations imposed by the flow geometries. The wide shear layers in
the highly symmetric linear shear and inclined plane flows are consistent with
the simple constitutive assumption that, in analogy with solid friction, the
effective-friction coefficient (ratio between shear and normal stresses) is a
constant. However, this standard picture of granular flows is shown to be
inconsistent with flows in the less symmetric split-bottom geometry - here the
effective friction coefficient must vary throughout the shear zone, or else the
shear zone localizes. We suggest that a subtle dependence of the
effective-friction coefficient on the orientation of the sliding layers with

cover inelastic tunneling as well. Namely, we show that inelastic tunneling

properties of curvature tensors in the horizon limit. It is determined that the
Weyl, Ricci, Riemann and Einstein tensors are algebraically special and
mutually aligned on the horizon. It is also pointed out that results obtained
in the tetrad adjusted to a static observer in general differ from those
obtained in a free-falling frame. This is connected to the fact that a static
observer becomes null on the horizon.
  It is also shown that finiteness of the Kretschmann scalar on the horizon is
compatible with the divergence of the Weyl component $\Psi_{3}$ or $\Psi_{4}$
in the freely falling frame. Furthermore finiteness of $\Psi_{4}$ is compatible
with divergence of curvature invariants constructed from second derivatives of
the Riemann tensor.
  We call the objects with finite Krestschmann scalar but infinite $\Psi_{4}$
``truly naked black holes''. In the (ultra)extremal versions of these objects
the structure of the Einstein tensor on the horizon changes due to extra terms
as compared to the usual horizons, the null energy condition being violated at
some portions of the horizon surface. The demand to rule out such divergencies
leads to the constancy of the factor that governs the leading term in the
asymptotics of the lapse function and in this sense represents a formal analog
of the zeroth law of mechanics of non-extremal black holes. In doing so, all
extra terms in the Einstein tensor automatically vanish.

cross section beyond leading order. We consider neutralino annihilation via
squark exchange and parameterize the effective annihilation vertex as a
dimension-six operator suppressed by two powers of the squark mass and related
to the divergence of the axial vector current of the final-state quarks. Since
the axial vector current is conserved at tree level in the limit of massless
quarks, this dimension-six operator contains a suppression by the quark mass.
The quark mass suppression can be lifted in two ways: (1) by corrections to the
dimension-six operator involving the anomalous triangle diagram, and (2) by
going to dimension-eight. We address the first of these possibilities by
evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram, which contributes to neutralino
annihilation to gluon pairs. We relate the triangle diagram via the anomaly
equation to the decay of a pseudoscalar into two gluons and use the
Adler-Bardeen theorem to extract the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD
corrections to chi chi --> gg from the known corrections to pseudoscalar decay.
The strong dependence of the dominant chi chi --> q qbar cross section on the
relative velocity of the neutralinos makes these NLO corrections unimportant at
chi decoupling but significant today.

Killing spinors of the null backgrounds have stability subgroups
$K\ltimes\bR^8$ in $Spin(9,1)$, for $K=Spin(7)$, SU(4), $Sp(2)$, $SU(2)\times

null $\hat\nabla$-parallel vector field while the latter admit a timelike and
two, three, five and nine spacelike $\hat\nabla$-parallel vector fields,
respectively. The spacetime of the null backgrounds is a Lorentzian
two-parameter family of Riemannian manifolds $B$ with skew-symmetric torsion.
If the rotation of the null vector field vanishes, the holonomy of the
connection with torsion of $B$ is contained in $K$. The spacetime of time-like
backgrounds is a principal bundle $P$ with fibre a Lorentzian Lie group and
base space a suitable Riemannian manifold with skew-symmetric torsion. The
principal bundle is equipped with a connection $\lambda$ which determines the
non-horizontal part of the spacetime metric and of $H$. The curvature of
$\lambda$ takes values in an appropriate Lie algebra constructed from that of
$K$. In addition $dH$ has only horizontal components and contains the
Pontrjagin class of $P$. We have computed in all cases the Killing spinor
bilinears, expressed the fluxes in terms of the geometry and determine the

one can decompose the map into a parallel product of two reflexible maps. This
can be achieved if and only if the monodromy (or the automorphism) group of the
map has at least two minimal normal subgroups. All reflexible maps up to 100
edges, which are not parallel-product decomposable, are calculated and
presented. For this purpose, all degenerate and slightly-degenerate reflexible
maps are classified.
  Three different quotients of rooted maps are considered in the paper and a
characterizaton of morphisms of rooted maps similar to the first isomorphism
theorem for groups is presented. The monodromy quotient of a map is introduced,
having the property that all the automorphisms project.
  A theory of edge-transitive maps on non-orientable surfaces is developed. A
concept of reduced regularty in the manner of Breda d'Azevedo is applied on
edge-transitive maps. Using that, the concept of parallel-product
decomposability is extended to edge-transitive maps, where a characterization
in terms of minimal normal subgroups of the automorphism group is obtained.
Additionally, using Petrie triality and the parallel-product decomposition, a
new organization of edge-transitive maps is presented, providing a basis for
future censuses.

allowed to quickly grow with sample size n, as fast as O(n^a) for any

the neighborhoods in the DAG are of lower order than sample size n. We
empirically demonstrate the PC-algorithm for simulated data and argue that the

specific nonlinear diffusion process at any positive bounded time. This process
is issued from kinetic theory and is called Landau process, by analogy with the
associated deterministic Fokker-Planck-Landau equation. It is not Markovian,
its coefficients are not bounded and the diffusion matrix is degenerate.
Nevertheless, the specific form of the diffusion matrix and the nonlinearity
imply the non-degeneracy of the Malliavin matrix and then the existence and
smoothness of the density. In order to obtain a lower bound for the density,
the known results do not apply. However, our approach follows the main idea
consisting in discretizing the interval time and developing a recursive method.
To this aim, we prove and use refined results on conditional Malliavin
calculus. The lower bound implies the positivity of the solution of the Landau
equation, and partially answers to an analytical conjecture. We also obtain an
upper bound for the density, which again leads to an unusual estimate due to
the bad behavior of the coefficients.

in-principle limitations when the information is quantum. This poses a critical
issue in quantum information theory, for distributed processing and networked
communications. For pure states ideal broadcasting coincides with the so-called
""quantum cloning"", describing an hypothetical ideal device capable of producing
from a finite number N of copies of a state (drawn from a set) a larger number
M>N of output copies of the same state. Since such a transformation is not
isometric, it cannot be achieved by any physical machine for a quantum state
drawn from a non orthogonal set: this is essentially the content of the
""no-cloning"" theorem. For mixed states the situation is quite different, since
from the point of view of each single user a local marginal mixed state is
indistinguishable from the partial trace of an entangled state, and there are
infinitely many joint output states that correspond to ideal broadcasting.
Indeed, for sufficiently large number $N$ of input copies, not only ideal
broadcasting of noncommuting mixed states is possible, but one can even purify
the state in the process. Such state purification with an increasing number of
copies has been named ""superbroadcasting"". In this paper we will review some
recent results on superbroadcasting of qubits, for two different sets of input

in atomic Rb-87 vapors. EIT and slow light are achieved by shining a strong,
resonant ``pump'' laser on the atomic medium, which allows slow and
unattenuated propagation of a weaker ``signal'' beam, but only when a
two-photon resonance condition is satisfied. Our wideband architecture is
accomplished by dispersing a wideband signal spatially, transverse to the
propagation direction, prior to entering the atomic cell. When particular
Zeeman sub-levels are used in the EIT system, then one can introduce a magnetic
field with a linear gradient such that the two-photon resonance condition is
satisfied for each individual frequency component. Because slow light is a
group velocity effect, utilizing differential phase shifts across the spectrum
of a light pulse, one must then introduce a slight mismatch from perfect
resonance to induce a delay. We present a model which accounts for diffusion of
the atoms in the varying magnetic field as well as interaction with levels
outside the ideal three-level system on which EIT is based. We find the maximum
delay-bandwidth product decreases with bandwidth, and that delay-bandwidth
product ~1 should be achievable with bandwidth ~50 MHz (~5 ns delay). This is a
large improvement over the ~1 MHz bandwidths in conventional slow light systems
and could be of use in signal processing applications.
