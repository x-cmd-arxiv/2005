the Big Bang (redshift z~3) are presently undetected at those epochs. We
propose a solution to this cosmic `missing metals' problem in which such
elements are stored in gaseous halos produced by supernova explosions around
star-forming galaxies. By using data from the ESO/VLT Large Program, we find
that:(i) only 5%-9% of the produced metals reside in the cold phase, the rest
being found in the hot (log T=5.8-6.4) phase; (ii) 1%-6% (3%-30%) of the
observed CIV (OVI) is in the hot phase. We conclude that at z~3 more than 90%
of the metals produced during the star forming history can be placed in a hot
phase of the IGM, without violating any observational constraint. The observed
galaxy mass-metallicity relation, and the intergalactic medium and intracluster
medium metallicity evolution are also naturally explained by this hypothesis.

determination of the distance to, the type II supernovae (SN) SN1999em with
CMFGEN (Dessart & Hillier 2005a), based on spectrophotometric observations at
eight dates up to 40 days after discovery. We use the same iron-group metal
content for the ejecta, the same power-law density distribution (with exponent
n~10), and a Hubble-velocity law at all times. We adopt a H/He/C/N/O abundance
pattern compatible with CNO-cycle equilibrium values for a RSG/BSG progenitor,
with C/O enhanced and N depleted at later times. Based on our synthetic fits to
spectrophotometric observations of SN1999em, we obtain a distance of 11.5Mpc,
similar to that of Baron et al. (2004) and the Cepheid distance to the galaxy
host of 11.7Mpc (Leonard et al. 2003). Similarly, based on such models, the
Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) delivers a distance of 11.6Mpc, with
negligible scatter between photometric bandpass sets; there is thus nothing
wrong with the EPM as such. Previous determinations using the tabulated
correction factors of Eastman et al. (1996) all led to 30-50% underestimates:
we find that this is caused by 1) an underestimate of the correction factors
compared to the only other study of the kind by Dessart & Hillier (2005b), 2) a
neglect of the intrinsic >20% scatter of correction factors, and 3) the use of
the EPM at late times when severe line blanketing makes the method inaccurate.
The need of detailed model computations for reliable EPM distance estimates
thus defeats the appeal and simplicity of the method. However, detailed fits to
SN optical spectra, based on tailored models for individual SN observations,
offers a promising approach to obtaining distances with 10-20% accuracy, either
through the EPM or a la Baron et al. (2004).

  from version 2","Astrophys.J.648:652-665,2006","10.1086/505736",,"astro-ph",,"  AU Microscopii is a 12 Myr old M dwarf that harbors an optically thin,
edge-on disk of dust. The scattered light surface brightness falls with
projected distance b from the star as b^-a; within b = 43 AU, a = 1-2, while
outside 43 AU, a = 4-5. We devise a theory to explain this profile. At a
stellocentric distance r = r_BR = 43 AU, we posit a ring of parent bodies on
circular orbits: the ""birth ring,"" wherein micron-sized grains are born from
the collisional attrition of parent bodies. The ""inner disk"" at r < r_BR
contains grains that migrate inward by corpuscular and Poynting-Robertson (CPR)
drag. The ""outer disk"" at r > r_BR comprises grains just large enough to remain
bound to the star, on orbits rendered highly eccentric by stellar wind and
radiation pressure. How the vertical optical depth tau scales with r depends on
the fraction of grains that migrate inward by CPR drag without suffering a
collision. If this fraction is large, the inner disk and birth ring share the
same optical depth, and tau scales as r^-5/2 in the outer disk. By contrast,
under collision-dominated conditions, the inner disk is empty, and tau scales
as r^-3/2 outside. These scaling relations, which we derive analytically and
confirm numerically, are robust against uncertainties in the grain size
distribution. By simultaneously modeling the surface brightness and thermal
spectrum, we break model degeneracies to establish that the AU Mic system is
collision-dominated, and that its narrow birth ring contains a lunar mass of
decimeter-sized bodies. The inner disk is devoid of micron-sized grains; the
surface brightness at b < 43 AU arises from light forward scattered by the
birth ring. Inside b = 43 AU, the disk's V-H color should not vary with b;
outside, the disk must become bluer as ever smaller grains are probed.

variations by factors of 10 or more on timescales of minutes or shorter were
seen. The rapid and strong variability of this source sets it apart from
typical XRBs. In spite of large luminosity fluctuations, the spectral state of
the source did not change significantly during the dwells which suggests that
the physical emission processes did not change much during the observations.
The energy spectra during the dwells were dominated by a hard Comptonized
powerlaw component, indicative of the canonical low/hard state observed in
other BHXRBs. No soft thermal component was found in three out of the four RXTE
pointings. However spectral deconvolution of the observation with largest
average luminosity suggests an obscured, hot accretion disk. During one of the
observations we detected a short term (about 100s) soft X-ray dropout which is
apparently due to variability in the observed column density. Strong Fe
K$\alpha$ fluorescent emisssion line near 6.5 keV was detected with large
equivalent widths in the range of 700 - 1000eV. In the temporal domain, the
Fourier power spectra were dominated by red noise below a few Hz. Poisson noise

The strong Comptonized spectra, broad iron emission line, absence of disk

galaxy NGC1068, encompassing the well-known NIR inner bar. We have successively
disentangled the respective contributions of the ionized gas and stars, thus
deriving their 2D distribution and kinematics. The [OIII] and Hbeta emission
lines exhibit very different spatial distribution and kinematics, the latter
following inner spiral arms with clumps associated with star formation. Strong
inwards streaming motions are observed in both the Hbeta and [OIII] kinematics.
The stellar kinematics also exhibit clear signatures of a non-axisymmetric
tumbling potential, with a twist in both the velocity and h3 fields. We
re-examined the long-slit data of Shapiro et al (2003) using pPXF: a strong
decoupling of h3 is revealed, and the central decrease in h4 hinted in the
Sauron data is confirmed. These data also suggest that NGC1068 is a good
candidate for a so-called sigma-drop. We confirm the possible presence of two
pattern speeds. We also examine the stellar kinematics of bars formed in
N-body+SPH simulations built from axisymmetric initial conditions. These
successfully reproduce a number of properties observed in the 2D kinematics of
NGC1068, and the long-slit data, showing that the kinematic signature of the
NIR bar is imprinted in the stellar kinematics. The remaining differences
between the models and the observed properties are mostly due to the exclusion
of star formation and the lack of the primary large-scale oval/bar in the
simulations. These models suggest that the inner bar could drive a significant
amount of gas down to a scale of ~300 pc. This is consistent with the
interpretation of the sigma-drop in NGC1068 being the result of central gas
accretion followed by an episode of star formation.

law. This paper is involved to recover the Dehnen model and generalize the
model to account for galaxy elliptical shapes by means of curvilinear
coordinate systems and employing a symmetry principle. The symmetry principle
maps an orthogonal coordinate system to a light distribution pattern. The
coordinate system for elliptical galaxy patterns turns out to be the one which
is formed by the complex-plane reciprocal transformation $Z=1/W$. The resulting
spatial (3-dimensional) light distribution is spherically symmetric and has
infinite gradient at its centre, which is called spherical-nucleus solution and
is used to model galaxy central area. We can make changes of the coordinate
system by cutting out some column areas of its definition domain, the areas
containing the galaxy centre. The resulting spatial (3-dimensional) light
distributions are axisymmetric or triaxial and have zero gradient at the
centre, which are called elliptical-shape solutions and are used to model
global elliptical patterns. The two types of logarithmic light distributions
are added together to model full elliptical galaxy patterns. The model is a
generalization of the Dehnen model. One of the elliptical-shape solutions
permits realistic numerical calculation and is fitted to all R-band elliptical
images from the Frei {\it et al.}(1996)'s galaxy sample. The fitting is
satisfactory. This suggests that elliptical galaxy patterns can be represented

interferometric observation of EP Aqr, a semiregular pulsating star with a
double component line profile in the CO J=1-0 line. The broad component shows a
flat-top profile, and the narrow component shows a spiky strong peak. Though
the previous single dish observations suggested that the CO J=2-1 line exhibits
a Gaussian-like profile, the CO J=1-0 line does not. The spatial distributions
of both the narrow and broad components appears to be roughly round with the
same peak positions. No significant velocity gradient is seen. The
spatial-kinetic properties of the molecular envelope of EP Aqr are reminiscent
of a multiple shell structure model rather than a bipolar flow and disk model.
A problem of this interpretation is that no evidence of interaction between the
narrow and broad component regions is seen. A Gaussian-like feature seen in the
CO J=2-1 line might play a key role to understand the spatio-kinetic properties
of the molecular envelope of EP Aqr.

globular clusters outside the Local Group. We compare the psf-deconvolved
profiles with King models and derive structural parameters, ellipticities and
surface brightnesses. In general, our clusters are similar in size,
ellipticity, core radius and central surface brightness to their counterparts
in other galaxies, in particular those in NGC 5128 observed with HST by Harris
et al. (2002). However, they extend to higher ellipticities and larger
half-light radii than their Galactic counterparts. Combining our results with
those of Harris et al. fills in the gaps previously existing in $r_h - M_V$
parameter space and indicates that any substantial difference between presumed
distinct cluster types in this diagram, including for example the Faint Fuzzies
of Larsen & Brodie (2000) and the `extended, luminous' M31 clusters of Huxor et
al. (2005) is now removed and that clusters form a continuum in this diagram.
Indeed, this continuum now extends to the realm of the Ultra Compact Dwarfs. We
have carried out additional analysis to quantify the contamination by
background galaxies. This shows that, although galaxies cannot be easily told
apart from clusters in some of the structural diagrams, the combination of
excellent image quality and Washington photometry should limit the
contamination to roughly 10% of the population of cluster candidates.

the outer regions with respect to the inner ones, we predict an increase of the
mean stellar [<Mg/Fe>] ratio with radius, in very good agreement with the data
for NGC4697. This finding strongly supports the proposed outside-in formation
scenario for ellipticals. We show that, in spite of the good agreement found
for the [<Mg/Fe>] ratio, the predicted slope of the mass-weighted metallicity
gradient does not reproduce the one derived from observations, once a
calibration to convert indices into abundances is applied. This is explained as
the consequence of the different behaviour with metallicity of the
line-strength indices as predicted by a Single Stellar Population (SSP) and
those derived by averaging over a Composite Stellar Population (CSP). In order
to better address this issue, we calculate the theoretical ``G-dwarf''
distributions of stars as functions of both metallicity ([Z/H]) and [Fe/H],
showing that they are broad and asymmetric that a SSP cannot correctly mimick
the mixture of stellar populations at any given radius. We find that these
distributions differ from the ``G-dwarf'' distributions especially at large
radii,except for the one as a function of [Mg/Fe]. Therefore, we conclude that
in ellipticals the [Mg/Fe] ratio is the most reliable quantity to be compared
with observations and is the best estimator of the star formation timescale at
each radius.(abridged)

successfully at the solar $Z$ and for the SMC, in particular, shear diffusion,
meridional circulation, horizontal turbulence, and rotationally enhanced mass
loss. Models of very low $Z$ experience a much stronger internal mixing in all
phases than at solar $Z$. Also, rotating models at very low $Z$, contrary to
the usual considerations, show a large mass loss, which mainly results from the
efficient mixing of the products of the 3$\alpha$ reaction into the H--burning
shell. This mixing allows convective dredge--up to enrich the stellar surface
in heavy elements during the red supergiant phase, which in turn favours a
large loss of mass by stellar winds, especially as rotation also increases the
duration of this phase. On the whole, the low $Z$ stars may lose about half of
their mass. Massive stars initially rotating at half of their critical velocity
are likely to avoid the pair--instability supernova. The chemical composition
of the rotationally enhanced winds of very low $Z$ stars show large CNO
enhancements by factors of $10^3$ to $10^7$, together with large excesses of
$^{13}$C and $^{17}$O and moderate amounts of Na and Al. The excesses of
primary N are particularly striking. When these ejecta from the rotationally
enhanced winds are diluted with the supernova ejecta from the corresponding CO
cores, we find [C/Fe], [N/Fe],[O/Fe] abundance ratios that are very similar to
those observed in the C--rich, extremely metal--poor stars (CEMP). We show that
rotating AGB stars and rotating massive stars have about the same effects on

$\leq 0.5M_\odot$ for the Vela pulsar, if the observational constraints of the
glitch healing parameter in the starquake model ($Q = I_{\rm core}/I_{\rm

observational constraints yield a realistic mass range for NS models,
corresponding to a core given by the stiffest equations of state (EOS) and the
envelope is characterized by the well known EOS of adiabatic polytrope, if the
continuity of the adiabatic speed of sound together with pressure,
energy-density, and the two metric parameters is assured at the core-envelope
boundary of the models and this boundary is worked out on the basis of the
`compatibility criterion' for hydrostatic equilibrium. The models yield the
surface redshift $z_R \simeq 0.6913$ and mass $M \simeq 2.153 M_\odot$ for the
``central'' weighted mean value, $Q = 0.12 \pm 0.07$, of the glitch healing
parameter of the Vela pulsar. These values of mass and surface redshift can
increase upto $M \simeq 2.196 M_\odot$ and $z_R \simeq 0.7568$ (which
represents an ultra-compact object (UCO; $z_R \geq 0.73$)) respectively for the
upper weighted mean value of $Q \simeq 0.19$. However, for the lower weighted
mean value of $Q \simeq 0.05$, the mass and surface redshift can decrease upto
the values of $M \simeq 2.052 M_\odot$ and $z_R \simeq 0.6066$ respectively.
The observation of the lower bound on the energy of a $\gamma$-ray pulse at
about 0.30 MeV from the Vela pulsar in 1984 is in excellent agreement with the
results of this study, provided this energy could be interpreted as the energy
of a gravitationally redshifted electron-positron annihilation radiation from
the star's surface.

about 4900 seconds after the GRB. The decay indices before and after the break
are consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the
'central engine' of the GRB to the fireball. Alternatively, this behaviour
could result if ejecta are released with a range of Lorentz factors with the
slower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. The two
scenarios are observationally indistinguishable. The GRB 050401 afterglow is
quite bright in the X-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical to
X-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. We detect a significant
amount of absorption in the X-ray spectrum, with N_H = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22
cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.
Such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30
magnitudes if we adopt the Galactic extinction law, which would not consistent
with optical detection of the afterglow. This suggests that the extinction law
is different from the Galactic one.

on the shape of the line profiles, we also introduce an initial toroidal

two counter-moving, identical periodic potentials (e.g. optical lattices). For
suitable lattice parameters a novel type of atomic band-gap structure appears
in which the effective atomic mass becomes infinite at the lowest edge of an
energy band. This way normal matter-wave diffraction (proportional to the
square of the atomic momentum) is replaced by fourth-order diffraction, and
hence the evolution of the system becomes sub-diffractive.

magnetization components, obtained by MOKE measurements, we were able to study
the uniaxial anisotropy induced during CoFeB-deposition and to discriminate the
magnetization processes under a magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to
such axis. MOKE magnetic imaging enabled us to observe the dominant
magnetization processes, namely domain wall motion and moment rotation. These
processes were correlated with the behavior of the magnetoresistance, which
depends both on short-range spin disorder electron scattering and on the angle
between the electrical current and the spontaneous magnetization
($\emph{\textbf{M}}_{S}$). A simple numerical treatment based on
Stoner-Wolfarth model enables us to satisfactorily predict the magnetization
behaviour observed in these films. A comparison between the results in
Co$_{73.8}$Fe$_{16.2}$B$_{10}$ films and the previous ones obtained in annealed
Co$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ films, show that the introduction of boron in CoFe reduces
significatively the coercive and saturation fields along the easy axis (e.g.
$H_{c}$ from $\sim$ 2 down to $\sim$ 0.5 kAm$^{-1}$). Also, the magnetization
along the hard axis saturates at lower fields. We conclude that amorphous and
nanocrystalline CoFeB films show low coercive fields and abrupt switching, as
well as absence of short range spin disorder effects after switching when
compared with Co$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$.

system is defined as a system which is stationary except for the direct effects
of the global cosmic expansion on the space-time geometry.) Field equations are
set up and an attempt is made to find an approximate series solution for the
exterior part. However, the result is that no stationary solution corresponding
to a spinning source can exist when considering terms beyond a certain order in
small quantities. That is, except for metrically static systems, axially
symmetric systems must necessarily be non-stationary in quasi-metric gravity.
However, sufficiently weak, axially symmetric gravitational fields associated

excellent approximation.
  Thus a truncated, approximately stationary solution is found for the exterior
field. To lowest order in small quantities, the gravito-magnetic part of the

approximation. On the other hand, the gravito-electric part of the found metric
family also includes a tidal term characterized by the free quadrupole-moment

space-time geometry has a crucial role. Normally, it is supposed to be a
geometrical field, but interestingly it also behaves like a physical field.
Thus it plays dual role in the arena of gravitation. This article is an
overview of the work related to dual roles of the Ricci scalar. A scalar is a
mathematical concept representing a spinless particle.Here, particle concept,
manifesting the physical aspect of the Ricci scalar, is termed as riccion.It is
a scalar particle with (mass)$^2$ inversely proportional to the gravitational
constant. Many intereseting consequences of dual role of the Ricci scalar are
discussed here. It causes inflationary scenario in the early universe without
taking another scalar like ``inflaton''. It is found that a riccion behaves
like an instanton also. This feature inspires``primordial inflation''.It is
interesting to see that a riccion, obtained from higher-dimensional space-time,
decouples into fermion and anti-fermion pair, if parity is violated. One-loop
renormalization of riccion indicates fractal geometry at high
energy.Homogeneous and inhomogeneous models of the early universe are derived
using dual role of the Ricci scalar. Production of spinless and spin-1/2
particles, due to riccion coupling, is discussed here. Contribution of riccion
to the cosmic dark energy is obtained here through one-loop renormalization and
it is shown that dark energy decays to dark matter during expansion of the
universe. It inspires a new cosmological scenario consistent with observational
evidences.

investigate whether the presence of viscous corrections to the evolution of a
collapsing gas cloud influence the fragmentation process. To this end we study
the dynamics of a uniform and spherically symmetric cloud with corrections due
to the negative pressure contribution associated to the bulk viscosity
phenomenology. Within the framework of a Newtonian approach (whose range of
validity is outlined), we extend to the viscous case either the Lagrangian,
either the Eulerian motion of the system and we treat the asymptotic evolution
in correspondence to a viscosity coefficient of the form $\zeta=\zeta_0
\rho^{nu}$ ($\rho$ being the cloud density and $\zeta_0=const.$). We show how,
in the adiabatic-like behavior of the gas (i.e. when the politropic index takes
values $4/3<\gamma\leq5/3$), density contrasts acquire, asymptotically, a
vanishing behavior which prevents the formation of sub-structures. We can
conclude that in the adiabatic-like collapse the top down mechanism of
structures formation is suppressed as soon as enough strong viscous effects are
taken into account. Such a feature is not present in the isothermal-like (i.e.
$1\leq\gamma<4/3$) collapse because the sub-structures formation is yet present
and outlines the same behavior as in the non-viscous case. We emphasize that in
the adiabatic-like collapse the bulk viscosity is also responsible for the
appearance of a threshold scale beyond which perturbations begin to increase.

We conclude that the apparent thermalization of quarks and gluons, leading to
success of perfect fluid hydrodynamics in describing heavy ion collisions at
RHIC, can only be attributed to the non-perturbative QCD effects not captured
by Feynman diagrams.
  We proceed by modeling these non-pertrubative thermalization effects using
viscous hydrodynamics. We point out that matching Color Glass Condensate inital
conditions with viscous hydrodynamics leads to continuous evolution of all
components of energy-momentum tensor and, unlike the case of ideal
hydrodynamics, does not give a discontinuity in the longitudinal pressure. An
important consequence of such a matching is a relationship between the
thermalization time and shear viscosity: we observe that small viscosity leads
to short thermalization time.

of quantum chromodynamics even though QCD is a broken conformal theory. A
holographic model based on a truncated AdS space can be used to obtain the
hadronic spectrum of light $q \bar q, qqq$ and $gg$ bound states. Specific
hadrons are identified by the correspondence of string modes with the dimension
of the interpolating operator of the hadron's valence Fock state, including
orbital angular momentum excitations. The predicted mass spectrum is linear $M
\propto L$ at high orbital angular momentum. Since only one parameter, the QCD
scale $\Lambda_{QCD}$, is introduced, the agreement with the pattern of
physical states is remarkable. In particular, the ratio of $\Delta$ to nucleon
trajectories is determined by the ratio of zeros of Bessel functions. One can
also use the extended AdS/CFT space-time theory to obtain a model for hadronic
light-front wavefunctions, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons
in QCD at the amplitude level. The model wavefunctions display confinement at
large inter-quark separation and conformal symmetry at short distances. In
particular, the scaling and conformal properties of the LFWFs at high relative
momenta agree with perturbative QCD. These AdS/CFT model wavefunctions could be
used as an initial ansatz for a variational treatment of the light-front QCD
Hamiltonian. Hadron form factors in both the space-like and time-like regions

possible to construct the quadrature domains explicitly, if the elliptic

tissue, and exhibit strong low-pass frequency filtering properties, with high
frequencies (such as action potentials) being visible only at very short
distances ($\approx$10~$\mu m$) from the recording electrode. Understanding
this filtering is crucial to relate LFP signals with neuronal activity, but not
much is known about the exact mechanisms underlying this low-pass filtering. In
this paper, we investigate a possible biophysical mechanism for the low-pass
filtering properties of LFPs. We investigate the propagation of electric fields
and its frequency dependence close to the current source, i.e. at length scales
in the order of average interneuronal distance. We take into account the
presence of a high density of cellular membranes around current sources, such
as glial cells. By considering them as passive cells, we show that under the
influence of the electric source field, they respond by polarisation, i.e.,
creation of an induced field. Because of the finite velocity of ionic charge
movement, this polarization will not be instantaneous. Consequently, the
induced electric field will be frequency-dependent, and much reduced for high
frequencies. Our model establishes that with respect to frequency attenuation
properties, this situation is analogous to an equivalent RC-circuit, or better
a system of coupled RC-circuits. We present a number of numerical simulations
of induced electric field for biologically realistic values of parameters, and
show this frequency filtering effect as well as the attenuation of
extracellular potentials with distance. We suggest that induced electric fields
in passive cells surrounding neurons is the physical origin of frequency
filtering properties of LFPs.

task to differentiate data numerically. Typically, this occurs when measured
data are concerned or data are evaluated numerically during the evolution of
partial or ordinary differential equations. Usually, one does not take care for
accuracy of the resulting estimates of derivatives because modern computers are
assumed to be accurate to many digits. But measurements yield intrinsic errors,
which are often much less accurate than the limit of the machine used, and
there exists the effect of ``loss of significance'', well known in numerical
mathematics and computational physics. The problem occurs primarily in
numerical subtraction, and clearly, the estimation of derivatives involves the
approximation of differences. In this article, we discuss several techniques
for the estimation of derivatives. As a novel aspect, we divide into local and
global methods, and explain the respective shortcomings. We have developed a
general scheme for global methods, and illustrate our ideas by spline smoothing
and spectral smoothing. The results from these less known techniques are
confronted with the ones from local methods. As typical for the latter, we
chose Savitzky-Golay filtering and finite differences. Two basic quantities are
used for characterization of results: The variance of the difference of the
true derivative and its estimate, and as important new characteristic, the
smoothness of the estimate. We apply the different techniques to numerically
produced data and demonstrate the application to data from an aeroacoustic
experiment. As a result, we find that global methods are generally preferable
if a smooth process is considered. For rough estimates local methods work
acceptably well.

responses evoked by identical stimuli often change dramatically from trial to
trial. The origin of this variability is uncertain, but it is usually
interpreted as detrimental noise that reduces the computational accuracy of
neural circuits. Here we investigate the possibility that such response
variability might, in fact, be beneficial, because it may partially compensate
for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths
of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or
neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the
accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an
interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections
are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of
response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network
performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance
is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in
some ways equivalent. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most
basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing
a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon
persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor)
networks and sensory-motor networks that perform coordinate transformations.
The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic
role in networks that continuously learn.

contextual information in various forms, such as past experience, expectations,
current goals, etc. Thus, the response to a specific stimulus, say the ringing
of a doorbell, varies depending on whether you are at home or in someone else's
house. What is the neural basis of this flexibility? What mechanism is capable
of selecting, in a context-dependent way, an adequate response to a given
stimulus? One possibility is based on a nonlinear neural representation in
which context information regulates the gain of stimulus-evoked responses. Here
I explore the properties of this mechanism. By means of three hypothetical
visuomotor tasks, I study a class of neural network models in which any one of
several possible stimulus-response maps or rules can be selected according to
context. The underlying mechanism based on gain modulation has three key
features: (1) modulating the sensory responses is equivalent to switching on or
off different subpopulations of neurons, (2) context does not need to be
represented continuously, although this is advantageous for generalization, and
(3) context-dependent selection is independent of the discriminability of the
stimuli. In all cases, the contextual cues can quickly turn on or off a
sensory-motor map, effectively changing the functional connectivity between
inputs and outputs in the networks. The model predicts that sensory responses
that are nonlinearly modulated by arbitrary context signals should be found in
behavioral situations that involve choosing or switching between multiple
sensory-motor maps.

locally-organized than the N one. Also this bias, though, is unlikely to be
related to vectorial effects, since it correlates with subtle differences in
the primary sequence. These findings indicate that even if proteins aquire
their structure vectorially no signature of this seems to be detectable in
their average structural properties.

the mind-brain interaction problem, i.e. how is it that the mind which is
subjective and immaterial, can interact with the brain which is objective and
material? Analysis of recent experiments appears to indicate that quantum
mechanics may have a role to play in the resolution of the mind-brain
interaction problem in the form of biological entanglement and nonlocality.
This analysis, when coupled with ongoing and proposed experiments, may help us
to simultaneously resolve related issues such as whether mental events can
initiate neural events, the transference of conscious subjective experience,
the measurement problem and the binding problem.

  Entanglement","Latex, 4 pages, No figures (Comments welcome)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the global infinitesimal change in the multi-particle pure
product state gives rise to an entangled state. This suggests that even if
there is no interaction present between the subsystems, i.e., at each time
instant the state is non-entangled, the tangent vector is typically entangled.
Since the tangent space vectors tell the state-space vectors how to change this
implies that quantum entanglement is necessary for motion or change in general.
This is truly a `hidden power' of quantum entanglement. During quantum
computation even though at each time instant the state is not entangled,
quantum entanglement guides the process of computation. This observation
applies to multi-particle pure, pseudo-pure and mixed states as well.

before the walk reaches an ending condition. To be analogous to the hitting
time for a classical walk, the quantum hitting time must involve repeated
measurements as well as unitary evolution. We derive an expression for hitting
time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the discrete walk on
the hypercube. The values found are compared to other analogues of hitting time
suggested in earlier work. The dependence of hitting times on the type of
unitary ``coin'' is examined, and we give an example of an initial state and
coin which gives an infinite hitting time for a quantum walk. Such infinite
hitting times require destructive interference, and are not observed
classically. Finally, we look at distortions of the hypercube, and observe that
a loss of symmetry in the hypercube increases the hitting time. Symmetry seems
to play an important role in both dramatic speed-ups and slow-downs of quantum
walks.

classical computer program. Each computational step is written using reversible
operators, but the operators remain classical in that the qubits take on values
of only zero and one. This classical restriction on the quantum states allows
the copying of qubits, a necessary requirement for doing general classical
computation. Parallel processing of the quantum algorithm proceeds because of
the superpositioning of qubits, the only aspect of the algorithm that is
strictly quantum mechanical. Measurement of the system collapses the
superposition, leaving only one state that can be observed. In most instances,
the loss of information as a result of measurement would be unacceptable. But
the linguistically motivated theory of Analogical Modeling (AM) proposes that
the probabilistic nature of language behavior can be accurately modeled in
terms of the simultaneous analysis of all possible contexts (referred to as
supracontexts) providing one selects a single supracontext from those
supracontexts that are homogeneous in behavior (namely, supracontexts that
allow no increase in uncertainty). The amplitude for each homogeneous
supracontext is proportional to its frequency of occurrence, with the result
that the probability of selecting one particular supracontext to predict the
behavior of the system is proportional to the square of its frequency.

""quantum chaos"", quantum computation and decoherence. In this paper, we study
this quantity semiclassically (as $\hbar \to 0$), taking as reference quantum
states the usual coherent states. The latter are known to be well adapted to a
semiclassical analysis, in particular with respect to semiclassical estimates
of their time evolution. For times not larger than the so-called ""Ehrenfest

Echo as a function of $t$ (time), $\hbar$ (Planck constant), and $\delta$ (the
size of the perturbation). The way two classical trajectories merging from the
same point in classical phase-space, fly apart or come close together along the
evolutions governed by the perturbed and unperturbed Hamiltonians play a major
role in this estimate. We also give estimates of the ""return probability""

the optical transition between ground and excited electronic states allows
