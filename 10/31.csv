the broad H-alpha emission from the reverse shock of the infant supernova

and hotspots, even at ground-based spatial resolution. We measure a total
dereddened H-alpha flux of 1.99(pm0.22)e-13 ergs/s/cm2 at an epoch 18.00 years
after outburst. At 50 kpc, the total reverse shock luminosity in H-alpha is
roughly 15 Lsun, which implies a total flux of neutral hydrogen atoms across
the reverse shock of 8.9e46/s, or roughly 2.3e-3 Msun/yr. This represents an
increase by a factor ~4 since 1997. Lyman continuum radiation from gas shocked
by the forward blast wave can ionize neutral hydrogen atoms in the supernova
debris before they reach the reverse shock. If the inward flux of ionizing
photons exceeds the flux of hydrogen atoms approaching the reverse shock, this
pre-ionization will shut off the broad Ly-alpha and H-alpha emission. The
observed X-ray emission of SNR1987A implies that the ratio of ionizing flux to
hydrogen atom flux across the reverse shock is presently at least 0.04. The
X-ray emission is increasing much faster than the flux of atoms, and if these

II] 12567/16435, often used as a reddening indicator, for which we empirically
derive an intrinsic value of 1.49, which is 10--40 per cent higher than
previous estimates. High-dispersion spectra of [Fe II] 16435 constrain the
geometry, detailed structure, and kinematics of P Cygni's nebula, which is the
major product of P Cygni's outburst in 1600 A.D. We use the [N II]/[N I] line

Msun; more than the mass lost by the stellar wind since the eruption. For this
mass, we would expect a larger infrared excess than observed. We propose that
the dust which obscured the star after the outburst has since been largely
destroyed, releasing Fe into the gas phase to produce the bright [Fe II]

radiation at a specific pulse phase is represented as the superposition of
radiation in two (approximately) orthogonally polarized modes (OPMs) from one
or more subsources in the emission region of the pulsar. For each subsource,
the polarization states are drawn randomly from statistical distributions, with
the mean and the variance on the Poincar\'e sphere as free parameters. The
intensity of one OPM is chosen from a log-normal distribution, and the
intensity of the other OPM is assumed to be partially correlated, with the
degree of correlation also chosen from a gaussian distribution. The model is
used to construct simulated data described in the same format as real data:
distributions of the polarization of pulses on the Poincar\'e sphere and
histograms of the intensity and other parameters. We concentrate on the
interpretation of data for specific phases of PSR B0329+54 for which the OPMs
are not orthogonal, with one well defined and the other spread out around an
annulus on the Poincar\'e sphere at some phases. The results support the
assumption that the radiation emerges in two OPMs with closely correlated
intensities, and that in a statistical fraction of pulses one OPM is invisible.

ages, i.e. >10 Gyr, with a wide range of metallicities. A trend of decreasing
alpha-element abundance ratio with increasing metallicity is indicated.
  The projected velocity dispersion of the GC system is consistent with being
constant with radius. Non-parametric, isotropic models require a significant
increase in the mass-to-light ratio at large radii. This result is in contrast
to that of Romanowsky et al. (2003) who find a decrease in the velocity
dispersion profile as determined from planetary nebulae. Our constant
dispersion requires a normal sized dark halo, although without anisotropic
models we cannot rigorously determine the dark halo mass.
  A two-sided chi^2 test over all radii, gives a 2 sigma difference between the
mass profile derived from our GCs compared to the PN-derived mass model of
Romanowsky et al. (2003). However, if we restrict our analysis to radii beyond
one effective radius and test if the GC velocity dispersion is consistently
higher, we determine a >3 sigma difference between the mass models, and hence
favor the conclusion that NGC 3379 does indeed have dark matter at large radii
in its halo. (abridged)

unique radio galaxy whose host is an obvious merger remnant, in an
exceptionally under-dense region of space. We have discovered near-infrared,
optical, and ultra-violet synchrotron emission from the jet. In the optical,
the jet is mostly obscured by a dust lane, but three knots are clear in our HST
NICMOS images at 1.6 and 2.0 microns, clearly aligning with features in the
radio. The outer jet knot is highly polarized (~15%) at 2 microns, confirming
the synchrotron emission mechanism. The radio-IR spectral index steepens
significantly with distance from the nucleus, as in 3C 273 and in contrast to M
87. The inner knot is visible (with hindsight) on the WFPC2 and STIS images
obtained for the earlier 3CR HST snapshot surveys. There is no [Fe II] emission
seen associated with the jet, constraining the role of shock-induced ionisation
by the jet. Overall there is a strong implication that the NIR jet emission is
indeed synchrotron.
  From our NIR images, the core of the galaxy is clearly identifiable with the
main feature in the western extension of the radio ``jet'' image, although no
unresolved AGN component is identifiable even at K-band, consistent with an
FRII-like nucleus obscured by an optically thick torus. The galaxy appears to
have a single nucleus, with any multiple nuclei falling within the central
</~100 pc.

[M. R. Zirnbauer, J. Math. Phys. 37, 4986 (1996)]. It emerges, for example, as
a low-energy description of a time-reversal invariant tight-binding model of
spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice, subject to random hopping, and
possessing particle-hole symmetry. It is known that, in the absence of
interactions, this disordered system is special in that it does not localize in
2D, but possesses extended states and a finite conductivity at zero energy, as
well as a strongly divergent low-energy density of states. In the context of
the hopping model, the short-range interactions that we consider are
particle-hole symmetric density-density interactions. Using a perturbative
one-loop renormalization group analysis, we show that the same mechanism
responsible for the divergence of the density of states in the non-interacting
system leads to an instability, in which the interactions are driven strongly
relevant by the disorder. This result should be contrasted with the limit of
clean Dirac fermions in 2D, which is stable against the inclusion of weak
short-ranged interactions. Our work suggests a novel mechanism wherein a clean
system, initially insensitive to interaction effects, can be made unstable to
interactions upon the inclusion of weak static disorder.

The topological transition in the graph structure is noticed with respect to
$p$. Leafy phase - a graph formed by multiple connected vertices (graph
skeleton) with plenty of leaves attached to each skeleton vertex emerges when
$p$ is small enough to pretend asynchronous evolution. Tangling phase where
edges of a graph circulate frequently among low degree vertices occurs when $p$
is large. There exist conditions at which the resulting stationary network

heterostructure (SDH) by means of a generalization of a theory developed some
years ago and based on a continuous medium model. The treatment considers the
coupling of electro-mechanical oscillations and involves dispersive phonons.
This approach has provided results beyond the usually applied dielectric
continuum models, where just the electric aspect of the oscillations is
analyzed. In the previous works on the subject the theory included phonon
dispersion within a quadratic (parabolic) approximation, while presently linear
contributions were added by a straightforward extension of the fundamental
equations. The generalized version of the mentioned theoretical treatment leads
to a description of long wavelength polar optical phonons showing a closer
agreement with experimental data and with calculations along atomistic models.
This is particularly important for systems where the linear contribution to
dispersion becomes predominant. We present a systematic derivation of the
underlying equations, their solutions for the bulk and SDH cases, providing us
a complete description of the dispersive modes and the associated
electron-phonon Hamiltonian. The results obtained are applied to the case of a
EuS/PbS/EuS quantum-well.

papers on generalizations of quantum mechanics needed for quantum gravity. The
need for generalization is motivated. The generalized quantum theory framework
for such generalizations is described and illustrated for usual quantum

spacetime alternatives extended over time, time-neutral quantum theory, quantum
field theory in fixed background spacetime not foliable by spacelike surfaces,
and systems with histories that move both forward and backward in time. A fully
four-dimensional, sum-over-histories generalized quantum theory of cosmological
geometries is briefly described. The usual formulation of quantum theory in
terms of states evolving unitarily through spacelike surfaces is an
approximation to this more general framework that is appropriate in the late
universe for coarse-grained descriptions of geometry in which spacetime behaves
classically. This abstract is unlikely to be clear on its own, but references

supersymmetric standard model particle content, extended by the addition of
three heavy right handed Majorana neutrinos and their supersymmetric partners,
and where the generation of neutrino masses is done via the seesaw mechanism.
Within this context, a significant lepton flavor mixing is generated in the
slepton sector due to the Yukawa neutrino couplings, which is transmited from
the high to the low energies via the renormalization group equations. This
slepton mixing then generates via loops of supersymmetric particles significant
contributions to the rates of $l_j \to 3 l_i$ and the correlated $l_j \to l_i
\gamma$ decays. We analize here in full detail these rates in terms of the
relevant input parameters, which are the usual minimal supergravity parameters
and the seesaw parameters. For the $l_j \to 3 l_i$ decays, a full one-loop
analytical computation of all the contributing supersymmetric loops is
presented. This completes and corrects previous computations in the literature.
In the numerical analysis compatibility with the most recent experimental upper
bounds on all these $\tau$ and $\mu$ decays, with the neutrino data, and with
the present lower bounds on the supersymmetric particle masses are required.
Two typical scenarios with degenerate and hierarchical heavy neutrinos are
considered. We will show here that the minimal supergravity and seesaw
parameters do get important restrictions from these $\tau$ and $\mu$ decays in
the hierarchical neutrino case.

matrix models. Generally, models based on the compact E6 seem to always include
doubly the degrees of freedom that we need physically. In this paper, we
propose one solution to this problem. A basic idea is that: `we regard that
each point of space-time corresponds to the center of projection of two
fundamental figures (i.e. two internal structures), and assume that the
projection of these fundamental figures from each point possesses one
transformation group as a whole.' Namely, we put emphasis on the `analogy' with
the projective geometry. Given that the whole symmetry is compact E6 * Gauge,
the space $(\Vec{\mathfrak{J}_H} \oplus i \Vec{H^3}) \times \Vec{\mathcal{G}}$
is promising as two subspaces seen from such a viewpoint. When this situation
is seen from the standpoint of Klein's Erlangen Program, each fundamental
figure should also have an independent transformation group. The symmetry
corresponding to this is Sp(4,H)/Z_2 * Gauge. This is ensured by the
introduction of the Yokota mapping Y. As a consequence, we result in the
picture of interacting pair universes which are being pi/2[rad]-phase-shifted.
This picture is applicable to all the models based on the compact E6, which may
be not only matrix models but also field theories. An interacting
bi-Chern-Simons model is provided when this result is applied to our previous
matrix model. This paper is one answer of the author to the doubling problem
which has been left in the previous paper.

gravitons. Non-forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific
additional relaxation of any photonic flux. It gives a possibility of another
interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. These facts may
implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm.
  A quantum mechanism of classical gravity based on an existence of this sea of
gravitons is described for the Newtonian limit. This mechanism needs graviton
pairing and ""an atomic structure"" of matter for working it, and leads to the
time asymmetry. If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is
realized in the nature, then an existence of black holes contradicts to
Einstein's equivalence principle. It is shown that in this approach the two
fundamental constants - Hubble's and Newton's ones - should be connected
between themselves. The theoretical value of the Hubble constant is computed.
In this approach, every massive body would be decelerated due to collisions
with gravitons that may be connected with the Pioneer 10 anomaly. Some unsolved
problems are discussed, so as possibilities to verify some conjectures in

rules needed to manage an effective field theory of strong interactions in

perturbation series and formulate two basic ones: uniformity and summability.
Relying on these principles one obtains the bootstrap conditions which restrict
the allowed values of the physical (observable) parameters appearing in the
extended perturbation scheme built for a given localizable effective theory.
The renormalization prescriptions needed to fix the finite parts of
counterterms in such a scheme can be divided into two subsets: minimal --
needed to fix the S-matrix, and non-minimal -- for eventual calculation of
Green functions; in this paper we consider only the minimal one. In particular,
it is shown that in theories with the amplitudes which asymptotic behavior is
governed by known Regge intercepts, the system of independent renormalization
conditions only contains those fixing the counterterm vertices with $n \leq 3$
lines, while other prescriptions are determined by self-consistency
requirements. Moreover, the prescriptions for $n \leq 3$ cannot be taken
arbitrary: an infinite number of bootstrap conditions should be respected. The
concept of localizability, introduced and explained in this article, is closely
connected with the notion of resonance in the framework of perturbative QFT. We
discuss this point and, finally, compare the corner stones of our approach with

  In this paper a similar approach is undertaken for a nonlinear Hartree-type

of the form V ~ x for $\alpha<1$, corresponding to the confinement potential,
introduced phenomenologically to the standard models for non relativistic

triple factorized and yields a fractional wave equation with internal SU(3)

analogy to the fractional Schroedinger equation derived. The angular momentum
eigenvalues are calculated algebraically. The resulting mass formula is applied
to the charmonium spectrum and reproduces the experimental masses with an
accuracy better than 0.1%. Extending the standard charmonium spectrum, three
additional particles are predicted and associated with $\Sigma_c^0(2455)$ and

17.2% larger than measured in the salt phase of the SNO detector (and if it
were significant it will indicate oscillation to sterile neutrinos). Hence it
is important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the
SSM. Currently, the largest fractional uncertainty is due to the new evaluation
of the surface composition of the sun. We examine the nuclear input on the
formation of solar 8B [S17(0)] and demonstrate that it is still quite uncertain
due to ill known slope of the measured astrophysical cross section factor and
thus ill defined extrapolation to zero energy. This yields an additional
reasonably estimated uncertainty due to extrapolation of +0.0 -3.0 eV-b (+0%
-14%). Since a large discrepancy exists among measured as well as among
predicted slopes, the value of S17(0) is dependent on the choice of data and
theory used to extrapolate S17(0). This situation must be alleviated by new
measurement(s). The ""world average"" is driven by the Seattle result due to the
very small quoted uncertainty, which we however demonstrate it to be an
over-estimated accuracy. We propose more realistic error bars for the Seattle
results based on the published Seattle data.

groups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1
is multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n +
c, c in [0,1). Such c not 0 have already been observed in cases like the
Aharonov-Bohm and the fractional quantum Hall effects and they correspond to
the quasi-momenta of Bloch waves in ideal crystals. The proposal of the present
paper is to look for fractional OAM in connection with the quantum optics of
Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in external magnetic fields. The quantum theory
of the phase space S_(phi,l) in terms of unitary representations of E(2) allows
for two types of ""coherent"" states the properties of which are discussed in
detail: Non-holomorphic minimal uncertainty states and holomorphic ones
associated with Bargmann-Segal Hilbert spaces.

has undergone a linear lossy channel. The scheme constitutes only a single beam
splitter and a homodyne detector, and thus is experimentally feasible. In
practice, a superposition of coherent states is transformed into a classical
mixture of coherent states by linear loss, which is usually the dominant
decoherence mechanism in optical systems. We also address the possibility of
producing a larger amplitude superposition state from decohered states, and
show that in most cases the decoherence of the states are amplified along with
the amplitude.

the observed state of multipartite systems of an arbitrary dimension. The
inequality also implies that a sufficient condition for a density operator to

fidelity to a generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state {[A. Cabello, Phys.

give a simple formula that gives a lower bound and an upper bound for the

{\it et al}. {[Nature (London) {\bf 403}, 515 (2000)]}, we show that the
observed state lies outside of the class of biseparable mixed three-qubit
states. We also show that for this class of operators, adopting the principle
of minimum variance {[Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 4338 (1999)]} in the state
estimation always results in the state with the minimum fidelity.
