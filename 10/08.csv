XMM-Newton/WFI survey carried out as part of the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS)
project. The aim of this survey is to provide optical imaging follow-up data in
BVRI for identification of serendipitously detected X-ray sources in selected
XMM-Newton fields. In this paper, fully calibrated individual and stacked
images of 12 fields as well as science-grade catalogs for the 8 fields located
at high-galactic latitude are presented. The data covers an area of \sim 3
square degrees for each of the four passbands. The median limiting magnitudes
(AB system, 2"" aperture, 5\sigma detection limit) are 25.20, 24.92, 24.66, and
24.39 mag for B-, V-, R-, and I-band, respectively. These survey products,
together with their logs, are available to the community for science
exploitation in conjunction with their X-ray counterparts. Preliminary results
from the X-ray/optical cross-correlation analysis show that about 61% of the
detected X-ray point sources in deep XMM-Newton exposures have at least one
optical counterpart within 2"" radius down to R \simeq 25 mag, 50% of which are
so faint as to require VLT observations thereby meeting one of the top
requirements of the survey, namely to produce large samples for spectroscopic
follow-up with the VLT, whereas only 15% of the objects have counterparts down
to the DSS limiting magnitude.

accuracy of 1 microarcsecond cannot be considered as point-like observers in
the framework of relativistic modelling of observable quantities.
  Aims. Special-relativistic effects on the imaging by a non-point-like

  Methods. A special-relativistic reflection law for a mirror of arbitrary
shape and motion is derived in the limit of geometrical optics. The aberration
patterns are computed with ray tracing using a full pecial-relativistic model
for two simple rotating optical instrument.
  Results. It was found that the effect of special-relativistic reflection law
on the photocenters of aberration patterns of an optical system rotating with a
moderate angular velocity of $60 \arcsec/{\rm s}$ may be at the level of 1
microarcsecond if the system involves mirrors significantly inclined relative
to the optical axis.
  Conclusions. Special-relativistic optical modelling of the future astrometric
instrument is generally speaking indispensable if a level of a few
microarcseconds is envisaged.

2403, NGC 3031, NGC 5194, and NGC 6946). Using Spitzer MIPS imaging and WSRT
radio continuum data, observed as part of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies
Survey (SINGS), we are able to probe variations in the logarithmic 24mu/22cm
(q_24) and 70mu/22cm (q_70) surface brightness ratios across each disk at
sub-kpc scales. We find general trends of decreasing q_24 and q_70 with
declining surface brightness and with increasing radius. The residual
dispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versus surface brightness is
smaller than the residual dispersion around the trend of q_24 and q_70 versus
radius, on average by ~0.1 dex, indicating that the distribution of star
formation sites is more important in determining the infrared/radio disk
appearance than the exponential profiles of disks. We have also performed
preliminary phenomenological modeling of cosmic ray electron (CRe^-) diffusion
using an image-smearing technique, and find that smoothing the infrared maps
improves their correlation with the radio maps. Exponential kernels tend to
work better than Gaussian kernels which suggests that additional processes
besides simple random-walk diffusion in three dimensions must affect the
evolution of CRe^-s. The best fit smoothing kernels for the two less active
star-forming galaxies (NGC 2403 and NGC 3031) have much larger scale-lengths
than those of the more active star-forming galaxies (NGC 5194 and NGC 6946).
This difference may be due to the relative deficit of recent CRe^- injection
into the interstellar medium (ISM) for the galaxies having largely quiescent
disks.

the 11-Msun model of Woosley & Weaver, from ~200 ms before bounce to ~300ms
after bounce, on a spatial grid that switches from Cartesian at the PNS center
to spherical above a 10km radius.
  As has been shown previously, we do not see any large-scale overturn of the
inner PNS material. Convection, directly connected to the PNS, is found to
occur in two distinct regions: between 10 and 20km, coincident with the region
of negative lepton gradient, and exterior to the PNS above 50km. Separating
these two regions, an interface, with no sizable outward or inward motion, is
the site of gravity waves, emerging at ~200-300ms after core bounce, excited by
the convection in the outer convective zone.
  In the PNS, convection is always confined within the neutrinospheric radii
for all neutrino energies above just a few MeV. We find that such convective
motions do not appreciably enhance the nu_e neutrino luminosity, and that they
enhance the anti-nu_e and ""nu_mu"" luminosities modestly, by ~15% and ~30%,
respectively, during the first post-bounce 100--200ms. Moreover, we see no
evidence of doubly-diffusive instabilities in the PNS, expected to operate on
diffusion timescales of at least a second, much longer than the millisecond
timescale associated with PNS convection.
  PNS convection is thus found to be a secondary feature of the core-collapse
phenomenon, rather than a decisive ingredient for a successful explosion.

explained by adding a clumpy cold dark matter (CDM) component to the potential
of the lens galaxy. Evans & Witt (2003) recently suggested that smooth
multipole perturbations can provide a reasonable alternative to CDM
substructure in some but not all cases. We generalize their method in two ways
so as to determine whether multipole models can explain highly anomalous
systems. We carry the multipole expansion to higher order, and also include
external tidal shear as a free parameter. Fitting for the shear proves crucial
to finding a physical (positive-definite density) model. For B1422+231, working
to order k = 5 (and including shear) yields a model that is physical but
implausible. Going to higher order (k >~ 9) reduces global departures from
ellipticity at the cost of introducing small scale wiggles near the bright
images. These localized undulations are more pronounced in B2045+265, where k ~
17 multipoles are required to smooth out large scale deviations from elliptical
symmetry. Such modes surely cannot be taken at face value; they must indicate
that the models are trying to reproduce some other sort of structure. Our
formalism naturally finds models that fit the data exactly, but we use
B0712+472 to show that measurement uncertainties have little effect on our
results. Finally, we consider the system B1933+503, where two sources are
lensed by the same foreground galaxy. The additional constraints provided by
the images of the second source render the multipole model unphysical. We
conclude that external shear must be taken into account to obtain plausible
models, and that a purely smooth angular structure for the lens galaxy does not
provide a viable alternative to the prevailing CDM clump hypothesis.

carefully constructed dome flat field screen. LEDs have several advantages over
more traditional illumination sources: they are available in a wide range of
output wavelengths, are inexpensive, have a very long source lifetime, and are
straightforward to control digitally. The circular dome screen is made of a
material with Lambertian scattering properties that efficiently reflects light
of a wide range of wavelengths and incident angles. We compare flat fields
obtained using this new system with two types of traditionally-constructed flat
fields: twilight sky flats and nighttime sky flats. Using photometric standard
stars as illumination sources, we test the quality of each flat field by
applying it to a set of standard star observations. We find that the dome flat
field system produces flat fields that are superior to twilight or nighttime
sky flats, particularly for photometric calibration. We note that a ratio of
the twilight sky flat to the nighttime sky flat is flat to within the expected
uncertainty; but since both of these flat fields are inferior to the dome flat,
this common test is not an appropriate metric for testing a flat field. Rather,
the only feasible and correct method for determining the appropriateness of a
flat field is to use standard stars to measure the reproducibility of known
magnitudes across the detector.

some discs around young ($\sim {\rm few} \times 10^6$ yr old) stars have
remarkably sharp transitions to a low density inner region in which much of the
material has been cleared away. It has been recognized that the most plausible
mechanism for the sharp transition at a specific radius is the gravitational
influence of a massive planet. This raises the question of whether the planet
can also account for the hole extending all the way to the star. Using high
resolution numerical simulations, we show that Jupiter-mass planets drive
spiral waves which create holes on time scales $\sim 10$ times shorter than
viscous or planet migration times. We find that the theory of spiral-wave
driven accretion in viscous flows by Takeuchi et al. (1996) can be used to
provide a consistent interpretation of the simulations. In addition, although
the hole surface densities are low, they are finite, allowing mass accretion
toward the star. Our results therefore imply that massive planets can form
extended, sharply bounded spectral holes which can still accommodate
substantial mass accretion rates. The results also imply that holes are more
likely than gaps for Jupiter mass planets around solar mass stars.

We find the ratio of the rise index r to the decay index d, derived when fitted
by the KRL function, increases quickly first and then remains nearly invariant
with the relative width of local pulses when the width exceeds 2. The rise and
decay times of pulses are found to be related to the Lorentz factor by a power
law, where the power law index associated with the rise time is less than that
of the decay time, and both are close to -2. In addition, the mean asymmetry
shows a slight trend of decreasing with Lorentz factors. In plots of decay
indices versus asymmetry, there is a descending phase and after this phase
there is a rising portion. We find that these long bursts of the KRL sample are
mainly associated with those light curves arising from co-moving pulses with
the relative width being larger than 0.1. We show that the effect of the
co-moving pulse shape on the KRL function parameters of the resulting pulses is
considerable and can be distinguished by the decay index d when the relative

present simple analytical fitting formulae for the accuracy with which the
preferred scale may be determined in the tangential and radial directions by
future spectroscopic and photometric galaxy redshift surveys. We express these
accuracies as a function of survey parameters such as the central redshift,
volume, galaxy number density and (where applicable) photometric redshift
error. These fitting formulae should greatly increase the efficiency of
optimizing future surveys, which requires analysis of a potentially vast number
of survey configurations and cosmological models. The formulae are calibrated
using a grid of Monte Carlo simulations, which are analyzed by dividing out the
overall shape of the power spectrum before fitting a simple decaying sinusoid
to the oscillations. The fitting formulae reproduce the simulation results with
a fractional scatter of 7% (10%) in the tangential (radial) directions over a

the relationship between the jet power and black hole mass, by estimating the
jet power using extrapolated extended 151 MHz flux density from the VLA 5 GHz
extended radio emission, for a sample of 146 radio loud quasars complied from
literature. After removing the effect of relativistic beaming in the radio and
optical emission, we find a significant intrinsic correlation between the jet
power and black hole mass. It strongly implies that the jet power, so as jet
formation, is closely connected with the black hole mass.To eliminate the
beaming effect in the conventional radio loudness, we define a new radio
loudness as the ratio of the radio extended luminosity to the optical
luminosity estimated from the broad line luminosity.In a tentatively combined
sample of radio quiet with our radio loud quasars, the apparent gap around the
conventional radio loudness R=10 is not prominent for the new-defined radio
loudness. In this combined sample, we find a significant correlation between
the black hole mass and new-defined radio loudness.

of this excitation, the polarization selection rules and the presence of its
overtone in resonance conditions allowed us to conclude that the origin of this
feature is magnetic. We proposed that it arises as a result of light coupling
to multi-spinon Raman excitations. Within this scenario we also argued for a
scenario explaining the puzzling temperature dependence of the magnetic
continuum in terms of an increasing role of next nearest neighbor frustration
and in the context of a strongly fluctuating low temperature phase. The second
topic is related to the observation of a folded S = 1 magnetic mode which
displayed very clear selection rules as a function of the magnetic field
orientation. We proposed that the coupling of the photon field to this
excitation takes place via the antisymmetric, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM),
interaction which, in a simple dimer model, can also explain the observed
selection rules: no splitting or shifts for magnetic fields parallel to the DM
vector and the observation of two (upward and downward) dispersing branches for
fields perpendicular to the DM vector. Thirdly, we discuss the nature of
several new resonances seen below T_c and focus on the possibilities that they
are either folded phonons or singlet bound states of two triplet excitations.

the spin-spin correlations in a self-doped two leg ladder may have a modulated
component besides the exponential decay characteristic of a spin liquid ground
state. We found that the 2M intensity resonates at the Mott gap energy.
Interplane Sr substitution for Ca introduces strong disorder leading to
inhomogeneous broadening of the 2M resonance. The doped holes in the spin
liquid ground state further dilute the magnetic correlations, suppressing the
spectral weight of this excitation. At high Ca concentrations are
superconducting under pressure and hole pairing was proposed to be a robust
feature of doped ladders. The measured dielectric response in the microwave
region, the low energy Raman data, the non-linear transport properties along
with soft x-ray scattering allowed us to conclude that the ground state for a
wide range of Ca concentrations (x < 12) is characterized by charge density
wave correlations. This state seems to be driven not by phonons but by Coulomb
forces and many-body effects. We highlighted the similarity in the finite
frequency Raman response as opposed to the very different behavior of the DC
resistivity between undoped and doped ladders. We found that at high Ca
concentrations the carrier relaxation is characterized by the same large
activation energy (~2000 K) as in the self-doped compound. This observation
prompted us to suggest an unconventional metallic transport driven by

iterative way to achieve the desired target SIR. In this paper, the convergence
of the UPC algorithm is proved for the matched filter, the decorrelator, and
the MMSE detector. In addition, the performance of the algorithm in finite-size

anisotropic configuration of a scalar field $\phi$ on a space-like hypersurface

spin-1 data, naturally taken to be the magnetic field $B_i$ on $\Sigma_{I,F}

be proportional to $\exp(iS_{\rm class})$, apart from corrections which are
very small when the frequencies in the boundary data are small compared to the
Planck scale. Here, $S_{\rm class}$ is the action of the classical solution.
The Lorentzian amplitude is found by taking the limit $\theta\to 0_+$. By a
method similar to that used in the spin-0 case, one obtains the quantum

of field theories have played a vital role in fundamental physics. But there is
recent interest in certain higher dimensional analogues of gauge theory, such
as p-form electromagnetism, including the Kalb-Ramond field in string theory,
and its nonabelian generalizations. It is desirable to discretize such `higher
gauge theories' in a way analogous to lattice gauge theory, but with the
fundamental geometric structures in the discretization boosted in dimension. As
a step toward studying discrete versions of more general higher gauge theories,
we consider the case of p-form electromagnetism. We show that discrete p-form
electromagnetism admits a simple algebraic description in terms of chain
complexes of abelian groups. Moreover, the model allows discrete spacetimes
with quite general geometry, in contrast to the regular cubical lattices
usually associated with lattice gauge theory. After constructing a suitable
model of discrete spacetime for p-form electromagnetism, we quantize the theory
using the Euclidean path integral formalism. The main result is a description
of p-form electromagnetism as a `chain field theory' -- a theory analogous to
topological quantum field theory, but with chain complexes replacing manifolds.
This, in particular, gives a notion of time evolution from one `spacelike
slice' of discrete spacetime to another.

much attention both theoretically and experimentally. The distribution of such
state over cells, however, is not only a result of intracellular stochastic
process, but is also influenced by the growth in cell numbers that depends on
the state. By incorporating the growth-death process into the standard
Fokker--Planck equation for the probability distribution, a nonlinear temporal
evolution equation of distribution is obtained that includes a self-consistent
growth term. The derived equation is generally solved analytically by means of
eigenfunction expansions. By focusing on the case with linear relaxation, two
examples are considered as applications of the proposed general formalism.
First, by assuming that the growth rate of a cell increases linearly with the
state value $x$, the shift of the average state value $x$ due to the growth
effect is shown to be proportional to the variance of the state $x$ and the
relaxation time, similarly with the biological fluctuation- response
relationship. Second, when there is a gap in the growth rate at some threshold
value for the state $x$, existence of a critical gap value is demonstrated,
beyond which the average growth rate starts to increase. This critical value is
again obtained in terms of the relaxation time and the variance of $x$, all of
which are experimentally measurable quantities. The relevance of the results to
the analysis of biological data on the distribution of cell states, as obtained
for example by flow cytometry, is discussed.

multilayer perceptron with back-propagation for training (MLP), in ecological
modelling. Overtraining on data or giving vague references to how it was
avoided is the major problem. Various methods can be used to determine when to
stop training in artificial neural networks: 1) early stopping based on
cross-validation, 2) stopping after a analyst defined error is reached or after
the error levels off, 3) use of a test data set. We do not recommend the third
method as the test data set is then not independent of model development. Many
studies used the testing data to optimize the model and training. Although this
method may give the best model for that set of data it does not give
generalizability or improve understanding of the study system. The importance
of an independent data set cannot be overemphasized as we found dramatic
differences in model accuracy assessed with prediction accuracy on the training
data set, as estimated with bootstrapping, and from use of an independent data
set. The comparison of the artificial neural network with a general linear
model (GLM) as a standard procedure is recommended because a GLM may perform as
well or better than the MLP. MLP models should not be treated as black box
models but instead techniques such as sensitivity analyses, input variable
relevances, neural interpretation diagrams, randomization tests, and partial
derivatives should be used to make the model more transparent, and further our
ecological understanding which is an important goal of the modelling process.
Based on our experience we discuss how to build a MLP model and how to optimize
the parameters and architecture.

how their bipartite entanglement can be accurately quantified in terms of the

measurements of the associated purities. For multimode Gaussian states endowed
with local symmetry with respect to a given bipartition, we show how the
multimode block entanglement can be completely and reversibly localized onto a
single pair of modes by local, unitary operations. We then analyze the
distribution of entanglement among multiple parties in multimode Gaussian
states. We introduce the continuous-variable tangle to quantify entanglement
sharing in Gaussian states and we prove that it satisfies the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality. Nevertheless, we show that pure,
symmetric three-mode Gaussian states, at variance with their discrete-variable
counterparts, allow a promiscuous sharing of quantum correlations, exhibiting
both maximum tripartite residual entanglement and maximum couplewise
entanglement between any pair of modes. Finally, we investigate the connection
between multipartite entanglement and the optimal fidelity in a
continuous-variable quantum teleportation network. We show how the fidelity can
be maximized in terms of the best preparation of the shared entangled resources

interpretation of several measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement,
including the entanglement of formation, the localizable entanglement, and the

its external degrees of freedom. In fact, the localization induced by a

dielectric plates is reconsidered on the basis of thermal quantum field theory
in Matsubara formulation. We briefly review two main derivations of the
Lifshitz formula in the framework of thermal quantum field theory without use
of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A set of special conditions is
formulated under which these derivations remain valid in the presence of
dissipation. The low-temperature behavior of the Casimir and van der Waals
interactions between dissimilar dielectrics is found analytically from the
Lifshitz theory for both an idealized model of dilute dielectrics and for real
dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivities. The free energy,
pressure and entropy of the Casimir and van der Waals interactions at low
temperatures demonstrate the same universal dependence on the temperature as
was previously discovered for ideal metals. The entropy vanishes when
temperature goes to zero proving the validity of the Nernst heat theorem. This
solves the long-standing problem on the consistency of the Lifshitz theory with
thermodynamics in the case of dielectric plates. The obtained asymptotic
expressions are compared with numerical computations for both dissimilar and
similar real dielectrics and found to be in excellent agreement. The role of
the zero-frequency term in Matsubara sum is investigated in the case of
dielectric plates. It is shown that the inclusion of conductivity in the model
of dielectric response leads to the violation of the Nernst heat theorem. The
applications of this result to the topical problems of noncontact atomic

significant step toward such possibilities, here we report observations of
entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distinct apparatuses on
different tables. Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by
one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an
entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 10^5 atoms at each

Furthermore, by strengthening the couplings gradually, the eigenenergy
corresponding to each of the discrete levels inside the continuum finally
emerges. On the other hand, the absence of the eigenenergy inside the continuum
is proved in weak but finite coupling regimes, provided that each of the form
factors that determine the transition between some definite level and the

Hence it is shown that the evolution of the probability density is given by
Schroedinger equation.
