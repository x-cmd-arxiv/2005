  ""Realistic"" Magnetic Field Structure","submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.641:984-992,2006","10.1086/500541",,"astro-ph",,"  First-order Fermi acceleration processes at ultrarelativistic shocks are
studied with Monte Carlo simulations. The accelerated particle spectra are
derived by integrating the exact particle trajectories in a turbulent magnetic
field near the shock. ''Realistic'' features of the field structure are
included. We show that the main acceleration process at superluminal shocks is
the particle compression at the shock. Formation of energetic spectral tails is
possible in a limited energy range only for highly perturbed magnetic fields,
with cutoffs occuring at low energies within the resonance energy range
considered. These spectral features result from the anisotropic character of
particle transport in the downstream magnetic field, where field compression
produces effectively 2D perturbations. Because of the downstream field
compression, the acceleration process is inefficient in parallel shocks for
larger turbulence amplitudes, and features observed in oblique shocks are
recovered. For small-amplitude turbulence, wide-energy range particle spectra
are formed and modifications of the process due to the existence of long-wave
perturbations are observed. In both sub- and superluminal shocks, an increase
of \gamma leads to steeper spectra with lower cut-off energies. The spectra
obtained for the ``realistic'' background conditions assumed here do not
converge to the ``universal'' spectral index claimed in the literature. Thus
the role of the first-order Fermi process in astrophysical sources hosting
relativistic shocks requires serious reanalysis.

X-ray point sources and HST archival data supplemented by ground observations
to identify 6173 GCs. We associate 209 LMXBs with red GC (RGC) and 76 LMXBs
with blue GCs (BGC), while we find no optical GC counterpart for 258 LMXBs.
This is the largest GC-LMXB sample studied so far. We confirm previous reports
suggesting that the fraction of GCs associated with LMXBs is 3 times larger in
RGCs than in BGCs, indicating that metallicity is a primary factor in the
GC-LMXB formation. While as already known, the brighter (and bigger) GCs have a
higher probability to host LMXBs, we find that this optical luminosity (or
mass) dependency is stronger in RGCs than in BGCs. We also find that GCs
located near the galaxy center have a higher probability to harbor LMXBs
compared to those in the outskirts. The radial distributions of GC-LMXBs (for
both RGC and BGC) are steeper than those of the whole optical GC sample, but
consistent with those of the optical halo light, suggesting that there must be
another parameter (in addition to metallicity) governing LMXB formation in GCs.
This second parameter must depend on the galacto-centric distance. We find no
statistically significant difference in the X-ray properties among RGC-LMXBs,
BGC-LMXBs and field-LMXBs. The similarity of the X-ray spectra of BGC-LMXBs and
RGC-LMXBs is inconsistent with the irradiation-induced stellar wind model

brightness of the object is sufficient to yield a time resolution as tight as 1

as the signature of an unusual wind interaction. We indeed expect that, in this
O+B system, the dominant primary wind crashes into the secondary surface,
leading to a wind-photosphere interaction. As a strong support to our
interpretation, we provide a geometrical model that associates an extra X-ray
emission to the secondary inner surface. Though quite simple, the present model

systems and physical nanosystems can be treated in terms of quantum relaxation
processes which couple to one or several fluctuating environments. A thermal
equilibrium environment can conveniently be modelled by a thermal bath of
harmonic oscillators. An archetype situation provides a two-state dissipative
quantum dynamics, commonly known under the label of a spin-boson dynamics. An
interesting and nontrivial physical situation emerges, however, when the
quantum dynamics evolves far away from thermal equilibrium. This occurs, for
example, when a charge transferring medium possesses nonequilibrium degrees of
freedom, or when a strong time-dependent control field is applied externally.
Accordingly, certain parameters of underlying quantum subsystem acquire
stochastic character. Herein, we review the general theoretical framework which
is based on the method of projector operators, yielding the quantum master
equations for systems that are exposed to strong external fields. This allows
one to investigate on a common basis the influence of nonequilibrium
fluctuations and periodic electrical fields on quantum transport processes.
Most importantly, such strong fluctuating fields induce a whole variety of
nonlinear and nonequilibrium phenomena. A characteristic feature of such
dynamics is the absence of thermal (quantum) detailed balance.

evidence of density anomalies. We show that, differing from models of

(not very different from the hexagonal ice packing fraction) at which the bond
tetrahedral network fully develops. We find evidence of the dynamic anomalies
characterizing network forming liquids. Indeed, around the optimal network
packing, dynamics fasten both on increasing and decreasing the packing

6.7 times the band mass and which decreases slighly with increasing frequency.
These disparate behaviors are consistent with calculations based on the
fluctuation-exchange interaction using current vertex corrections.

have limited ourselves to the test-mass regime, where we model a test particle
in a circular equatorial orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our objective
is to model the numerical gravitational wave flux function, starting with the
post-Newtonian expansion from Black Hole Perturbation Theory. We introduce a
new Chebyshev approximation to the flux function, which due to a process called
Chebyshev economization gives a better model than either post-Newtonian or Pade
based methods. A graphical examination of the new flux function shows that it
gives an excellent fit to the numerical flux, but more importantly we find that
at the last stable orbit the error is reduced, < 1.8%, at all orders of
approximation. We also find that the templates constructed using the Chebyshev
approximation give better fitting factors, in general > 0.99, and smaller
errors, < 1/10%, in the estimation of the Chirp mass when compared to a
fiducial exact waveform, constructed using the numerical flux and the exact
expression for the orbital energy function, again at all orders of

renormalization if they are to satisfy continuum Ward--Takahashi identities up
to small lattice corrections of O(a^2). Algorithmic difficulties at coarse
lattice spacings, where HMC suffers from a distorted Dirac spectrum, are
discussed. This is shown to be a cutoff effect, which disappears rapidly as the
lattice spacing is decreased. An alternative algorithm, the polynomial hybrid
Monte Carlo algorithm, is found to perform significantly better in the presence
of exceptionally small eigenvalues. Extending previously used methods both the
improvement and the renormalization of the axial current are implemented

framework of the Schroedinger functional. In both cases this is achieved by
enforcing continuum Ward identities at finite lattice spacing. Together, this

spectra of J/Psi, characterized by <p_T^2>, which result from the formation
process in which the charm quark distributions are unchanged from their initial
production in a pQCD process. This is contrasted with the case in which the
charm quarks have completely come into thermal equilibrium with an expanding
medium whose properties are determined by the spectra of produced light
hadrons. We find that the resulting <p_T^2> of the formed J/Psi provide a
distinct signature of the underlying charm quark spectra, and that signature is
essentially independent of the detailed dynamics of the in-medium formation
reaction. In addition, both of these signatures are sufficiently separated from
the case in which no in-medium formation takes place. Finally, utilizing a
model for the fraction of J/Psi which originate from in-medium formation, we
predict the centrality behavior of these signatures.

built from a quark and an antiquark and a heavy gluon that typically resides
between the quarks, cannot produce rotationally symmetric amplitude. However,
there exists an alternative generic picture in the model that does satisfy the
requirements of special relativity. Namely, the distance between the quark and
antiquark must be much smaller than the distance between the gluon and the pair

contributions from states invariant under at least one supercharge and captures
all information -- that may be obtained purely from group theory -- about
protected short representations in 4 dimensional superconformal field theories.
In the case of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory our index is a function of four
continuous variables. We compute it at weak coupling using gauge theory and at
strong coupling by summing over the spectrum of free massless particles in
$AdS_5\times S^5$ and find perfect agreement at large $N$ and small charges.
Our index does not reproduce the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in
$AdS_5$, but this is not a contradiction, as it differs qualitatively from the
partition function over supersymmetric states of the ${\cal N}=4$ theory. We
note that entropy for some small supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black holes may be
reproduced via a D-brane counting involving giant gravitons. For big black
holes we find a qualitative (but not exact) agreement with the naive counting
of BPS states in the free Yang Mills theory. In this paper we also evaluate and
study the partition function over the chiral ring in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang
Mills theory.

steady state spiral density waves moving at different patterns speeds. Our
investigation is based on direct numerical integration of initially circular
test-particle orbits. We examine a range of spiral strengths and spiral speeds
and show that stars in this time dependent gravitational field can be heated
(their random motions increased). This is particularly noticeable in the
simultaneous propagation of a 2-armed spiral density wave near the corotation
resonance (CR), and a weak 4-armed one near the inner and outer 4:1 Lindblad
resonances. In simulations with 2 spiral waves moving at different pattern
speeds we find: (1) the variance of the radial velocity, sigma_R^2, exceeds the
sum of the variances measured from simulations with each individual pattern;
(2) sigma_R^2 can grow with time throughout the entire simulation; (3)
sigma_R^2 is increased over a wider range of radii compared to that seen with
one spiral pattern; (4) particles diffuse radially in real space whereas they
don't when only one spiral density wave is present. Near the CR with the
stronger, 2-armed pattern, test particles are observed to migrate radially.
These effects take place at or near resonances of both spirals so we interpret
them as the result of stochastic motions. This provides a possible new
mechanism for increasing the stellar velocity dispersion in galactic disks. If
multiple spiral patterns are present in the Galaxy we predict that there should
be large variations in the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of radius.

topological chaos in a viscous fluid. We show that it is possible to extend
their work to cases where the motion of the stirring rods is topologically
trivial by considering the dynamics of special periodic points that we call
ghost rods, because they play a similar role to stirring rods. The ghost rods
framework provides a new technique for quantifying chaos and gives insight into
the mechanisms that produce chaos and mixing. Numerical simulations for Stokes

effect on material lines that is similar to real stirring rods. An example is a
periodic island: material lines exterior to it must wrap around such an island,
because determinism forbids them from crossing through it. Hence, islands act
as topological obstacles to material lines, just like physical rods, and lower
bounds on the rate of stretching of material lines can be deduced from the
motion of islands and rods. Here, we show that unstable periodic orbits can
also act as ghost rods, as long as material lines can 'fold' around the orbit,
which requires the orbit to be parabolic. We investigate the factors that
determine the effective size of ghost rods, that is, the magnitude of their
impact on material lines.

chiral rotation cannot exist below a certain critical frequency is further
illustrated and discussed, together with the microscopic origin of a transition
from the planar to chiral rotation in nuclei. We also formulate the
separability rule by which the Tilted-Axis-Cranking solutions can be inferred
from three independent Principal-Axis-Cranking solutions corresponding to three

fluorescence in a cascade three-level diatomic Lithium system using
Optical-Optical Double Resonance (OODR) spectroscopy. When a strong coupling
laser couples the intermediate state $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v=13, J=14)$ to the
upper state $G^{1}\Pi_{g}(v=11, J=14)$ of $^7Li_2$, the fluorescence from both
$A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}$ and $G^{1}\Pi_{g}$ states was drastically reduced as the
weak probe laser was tuned through the resonance transition between the ground
state $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}(v=4, J=15)$ and the excited state
$A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v=13, J=14)$. The strong coupling laser makes an optically
thick medium transparent for the probe transition. In addition, The fact that
fluorescence from the upper state $G^{1}\Pi_{g}(v=11, J=14)$ was also dark when
both lasers were tuned at resonance implies that the molecules were trapped in
the ground state. We used density matrix methods to simulate the response of an
open molecular three-level system to the action of a strong coupling field and
a weak probe field. The analytical solutions were obtained under the
steady-state condition. We have incorporated the magnetic sublevel (M)
degeneracy of the rotational levels in the lineshape analysis and report $|M|$
dependent lineshape splitting. The theoretical calculations are in excellent
agreement with the observed fluorescence spectra. We show that the coherence is
remarkably preserved even when the coupling field was detuned far from the
resonance.
