two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for flat polytropic gaseous

disk was constructed to resemble that of the proto-typical galaxy NGC 4650A.
This central perturbation induces initially a stationary two-armed
tightly-wound leading spiral in the polar disk. For a hot disk (Toomre
parameter Q>1.7), the structure does not change over the simulation time of 4.5
Gyr. In case of colder disks, the self-gravity of the spiral becomes dominant,
it decouples from the central perturbation and grows, until reaching a
saturation stage in which an open trailing spiral is formed, rather similar to
that observed in NGC4650A. The timescale for developing non-linear structures
is 1-2 Gyr; saturation is reached within 2-3 Gyr. The main parameter
controlling the structure formation is the Toomre parameter. The results are
surprisingly insensitive to the properties of the central component. If the
polar disk is much less massive than that in NGC4650A, it forms a weaker
tightly-wound spiral, similar to that seen in dust absorption in the dust disk
of NGC2787. Our results are derived for a polytropic equation of state, but
appear to be generic as the adiabatic exponent is varied between \gamma = 1

from the base of the jet. Homogeneous models fail to reproduce the spectral

comply with the unified scheme of BL Lacertae (BL) objects and FR I radio

\~ 5 over a length of ~ 0.1 pc reproduces the observed SED of the M87 core,
and, when aligned to the line of sight, produces a SED similar to those of TeV
BLs. The TeV flux in the decelerating jet model is successfully reproduced as
upstream Compton (UC) scattering, a recently identified emission mechanism, in
which energetic electrons of the upstream faster flow upscatter the low energy
photons produced in the slower downstream part of the flow.

convergence towards the observed distribution of HI column densities. While in
our highest resolution model we recover the cumulative number of DLAs per unit
absorption distance, none of our models predicts DLA velocity widths as high as
indicated by the data, suggesting that feedback from star formation might be
important. At z=3 a non-negligible fraction of DLAs with column densities below
10^21 cm^-2 is caused by tidal tails due to galaxy-galaxy interactions in more
massive halo environments. Lower column density absorbers with N_HI < 10^21.4
cm^-2 are sensitive to changes in the UV background resulting in a 10%
reduction of the cumulative number of DLAs for twice the quasar background
relative to the fiducial value. We find that the mass cut-off below which a
large fraction of dwarf galaxies cannot retain gas after reionization is 7*10^7
msun, lower than the previous estimates. Finally, we show that models with

$\sim0.15$ mJy at 1.6 $\mu$m and continuous up to about 40% of the total

near-IR flare in which we observe for the first time correlated substructures
as well as simultaneous submillimeter and near-IR flaring. X-ray emission is
arising from the population of near-IR-synchrotron-emitting relativistic
particles which scatter submillimeter seed photons within the inner 10
Schwarzschild radii of Sgr A* up to X-ray energies. In addition, using the
inverse Compton scattering picture, we explain the high energy 20-120 keV
emission from the direction toward Sgr A*, and the lack of one-to-one X-ray
counterparts to near-IR flares, by the variation of the magnetic field and the
spectral index distributions of this population of nonthermal particles. In
this picture, the evidence for the variability of submillimeter emission during
a near-IR flare is produced by the low-energy component of the population of
particles emitting synchrotron near-IR emission. Based on the measurements of
the duration of flares in near-IR and submillimeter wavelengths, we argue that
the cooling could be due to adiabatic expansion with the implication that flare
activity may drive an outflow.

forming stars in the main disk outside of the nucleus and in the tidal plume,
with an estimated mean star formation rate of ~2 to 4 M_sun/yr. The most
prominent sites of mid-infrared emission define a ""ring"" morphology that,

solely powered by older stars, with little evidence for ongoing star formation
at the center of the Tadpole. Extra-nuclear star formation accounts for >50% of
the total star formation in the disk and spiral arms, featuring infrared-bright
'hot spots' that exhibit strong PAH emission, whose band strength is comparable
to that of late-type star-forming disk galaxies. The tidal tail, which extends

color transformations from model atmospheres are needed to achieve consistency
with observations of cool stars. Stellar models that are normalized to the Sun

metallicities than at [Fe/H] near 0.0. It is not clear that significant
improvements to current semi-empirical color-Teff relations for metal-deficient
stars will be possible until much tigher observational constraints become

In here, we analyze the spectra in detail. We show that the shape of spectrum
is not spoiled by differences in the Strehl ratio in the blue and in the red
part, as well as differential refraction. We reanalyze the spectra and derive
the spectral type of the companion using classical methods. We find that the
object has a spectral type between M9V and L4V, which corresponds to a Teff
between 1600 and 2500 K. Using GAIA-dusty models, we find that the spectral
type derivation is robust against different log(g)-values. The Teff derived
from the models is again in the range between 1800 and 2400 K. While the models
reproduce nicely the general shape of the spectrum, the 12CO-lines in the
spectrum have about half the depth as those in the model. We speculate that
this difference might be caused by veiling, like in other objects of similar
age, and spectral class. We also find that the absolute brightness of the
companion matches that of other low-mass free-floating objects of similar age
and spectral type. A comparison with the objects in USco observed by Mohanty et
al. (2004) shows that the companion of GQ Lup has a lower mass than any of
these, as it is of later spectral type, and younger. The same is as true, for
the companion of AB Pic. To have a first estimate of the mass of the object we

projected rotational velocity. The preliminary result is v_{rot}sin{i} = 97 +/-
9 km/s. Since the rotation of the sdB star is very likely tidally locked to the
orbit, we can constrain the inclination of the system. Assuming the companion
to be a white dwarf, the mass of the sdB is limited from 0.44M_{sun} to
0.63M_{sun} and the total mass range of the system is 1.3 M_{sun} to 2.0
M_{sun}. It is very likely that the total mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit.
Hence KPD 1930+2752 is a candidate for a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova.
According to the derived limits for the inclination angle, eclipses are likely
to occur.

combining its X-ray emission with the cosmic microwave background fluctution
due to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The application of this distance indicator
usually assumes that the cluster is spherically symmetric, the gas is
distributed according to the isothermal beta-model, and the X-ray temperature
is an unbiased measure of the electron temperature. We test these assumptions
with galaxy clusters extracted from an extended set of cosmological
N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of a LCDM concordance cosmology, which
include the effect of radiative cooling, star formation and energy feedback
from supernovae. We find that, due to the steep temperature gradients which are
present in the central regions of simulated clusters, the assumption of
isothermal gas leads to a significant underestimate of D_A. This bias is
efficiently corrected by using the polytropic version of the beta-model to
account for the presence of temperature gradients. In this case, once irregular
clusters are removed, the correct value of D_A is recovered with a ~ 5 per cent
accuracy on average, with a ~ 20 per cent intrinsic scatter due to cluster
asphericity. This result is valid when using either the electron temperature or
a spectroscopic-like temperature. When using instead the emission-weighted
definition for the temperature of the simulated clusters, D_A is biased low by
\~ 20 per cent. We discuss the implications of our results for an accurate
determination of the Hubble constant H_0 and of the density parameter Omega_m.
We find that H_0 can be potentially recovered with exquisite precision, while
the resulting estimate of Omega_m, which is unbiased, has typical errors
Delta(Omega_m) ~ 0.05.

Alibert et al. (2005a) to constrain the composition of ices incorporated in its
regular icy satellites. We consider CO2, CO, CH4, N2, NH3, H2S, Ar, Kr, and Xe
as the major volatile species existing in the gas-phase of the solar nebula.
All these volatile species, except CO2 which crystallized as a pure condensate,
are assumed to be trapped by H2O to form hydrates or clathrate hydrates in the
solar nebula. Once condensed, these ices were incorporated into the growing
planetesimals produced in the feeding zone of proto-Jupiter. Some of these
solids then flowed from the solar nebula to the subnebula, and may have been
accreted by the forming Jovian regular satellites. We show that ices embedded
in solids entering at early epochs into the Jovian subdisk were all vaporized.
This leads us to consider two different scenarios of regular icy satellites
formation in order to estimate the composition of the ices they contain. In the
first scenario, icy satellites were accreted from planetesimals that have been
produced in Jupiter's feeding zone without further vaporization, whereas, in
the second scenario, icy satellites were accreted from planetesimals produced
in the Jovian subnebula. In this latter case, we study the evolution of carbon
and nitrogen gas-phase chemistries in the Jovian subnebula and we show that the
conversions of N2 to NH3, of CO to CO2, and of CO to CH4 were all inhibited in
the major part of the subdisk. Finally, we assess the mass abundances of the
major volatile species with respect to H2O in the interiors of the Jovian
regular icy satellites. Our results are then compatible with the detection of
CO2 on the surfaces of Callisto and Ganymede and with the presence of NH3
envisaged in subsurface oceans within Ganymede and Callisto.

This 'breathing' effect is observed for the Hbeta emission in NGC 5548 by using

monitoring campaign. To model the breathing, we use two methods to fit the
observed lightcurves in detail: (i) parameterized models and, (ii) the MEMECHO
reverberation mapping code. Our models assume that optical continuum variations
track the ionizing radiation, and that the Hbeta variations respond with time
delays due to light travel time. By fitting the data using a delay map that is
allowed to change with continuum flux, we find that the strength of the Hbeta
response decreases and the time delay increases with ionizing luminosity. The
parameterized breathing models allow the time delay and the Hbeta flux to
depend on the continuum flux so that, the time delay is proportional to the
continuum flux to the power beta, and the Hbeta flux is proportional to the
continuum flux to the power alpha. Our fits give 0.1 < beta < 0.46 and 0.57 <
alpha < 0.66. alpha is consistent with previous work by Gilbert and Peterson

sensitive observations have revealed that asymmetry of warps may be the norm
rather than exception. However there exists no generic mechanism to generate
these asymmetries in warps. We have derived the dispersion relation in a
compact form for the S-shaped warps(described by the m=1 mode) and the
bowl-shaped distribution(described by the m=0 mode) in galactic disk embedded
in a dark matter halo. We then performed the numerical modal analysis and used
the linear and time-dependent superposition principle to generate asymmetric
warps in the disk. On doing the modal analysis we find the frequency of the
$m=0$ mode is much larger than that of the $m=1$ mode. The linear and
time-dependent superposition of these modes with their unmodulated
amplitudes(that is, the coefficients of superposition being unity) results in
an asymmetry in warps of ~ 20 - 40 %, whereas a smaller coefficient for the m=0
mode results in a smaller asymmetry. The resulting values agree well with the
recent observations. We study the dependence of the asymmetry index on the dark
matter halo parameters. This approach can also naturally produce U-shaped warps
and L-shaped warps. We show that a rich variety of possible asymmetries in the
z-distribution of the spiral galaxies can naturally arise due to a dynamical
wave interference between the first two bending modes(i.e. m=0 and m=1) in the
disk. This is a simple but general method for generating asymmetric warps that
is independent of how the individual modes arise in the disk.

of three-point coupling, which can result from, e.g., corotating interaction
regions, wind shocks, or mass overloading. For a simple model of an overloaded

near-resonant material absorbs angular momentum emitted from some of the disc
particles and helps the bar become stronger. As a result, a bar (oval) forms in
the inner parts of the halo of strongly barred disc galaxies. It is thinner in
the inner parts (but still considerably fatter than the disc bar) and tends to
spherical at larger radii. Its length increases with time, while always staying
shorter than the disc bar. It is roughly aligned with the disc bar, which it
trails only slightly, and it turns with roughly the same pattern speed. The
bi-symmetric component of the halo density continues well outside the halo bar,
where it clearly trails behind the disc bar. The length and strength of the
disc and halo bars correlate; the former being always much stronger than the
latter. If the halo is composed of weakly interacting massive particles, then
the formation of the halo bar, by redistributing the matter in the halo and
changing its shape, could influence the expected annihilation signal. This is
indeed found to be the case if the halo has a core, but not if it has a steep
cusp. The formation and evolution of the bar strongly affect the halo orbits. A
fraction of them becomes near-resonant, similar to the disc near-resonant
orbits at the same resonance, while another fraction becomes chaotic. Finally,
a massive and responsive halo makes it harder for a central mass concentration
to destroy the disc bar.

namely the formation and evolution of bars, the formation of bulges, and the

Their evolution is driven by the exchange of angular momentum within the
galaxy. This is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the inner disc
(bar), and is absorbed by near-resonant material in the outer disc and in the
halo. As a result of this, the bar becomes stronger and rotates slower. Bulges
are not a homogeneous class of objects. Based on their formation history, one
can distinguish three types. Classical bulges are mainly formed before the
actual disc component, from collapses or mergers and the corresponding
dissipative processes. Boxy/peanut bulges are parts of bars seen edge-on.
Finally, disc-like bulges are formed by the inflow of material to the center
due to bar torques. Major mergers bring strong and fast evolution and can turn
discs into ellipticals. I present results from simulations of multiple mergers
in groups of disc or of elliptical galaxies and discuss the orbital anisotropy

are crucial for the validity of JE. As a solution to this daunting problem, we
propose a simple and efficient method, referred to as the FR method, for
calculating simultaneously both the PMF U(z) and the corresponding diffusion
coefficient D(z) along a reaction coordinate z for a classical many particle
system by employing a small number of fast SMD pullings in both forward (F) and
time reverse (R) directions, without invoking JE. By employing Crook's
transient fluctuation theorem (that is more general than JE) and the stiff
spring approximation, we show that: (i) the mean dissipative work W_d in the F

the easily calculable mean work of the F and R processes, and (iii) D(z) can be
expressed in terms of the slope of W_d. To test its viability, the FR method is
applied to determine U(z) and D(z) of single-file water molecules in
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The obtained U(z) is found to be in
very good agreement with the results from other PMF calculation methods, e.g.,
umbrella sampling. Finally, U(z) and D(z) are used as input in a stochastic

dimensional parabolic quantum dot containing three electrons. A Yukawa screened
Coulomb interaction is assumed, which allows us to discuss the evolution of the
electron-vortex correlations from the Coulomb interaction limit to the contact
potential limit. The vortex structure approaches the Laughlin limit
non-monotonically through the formation of intermediate composite fermions in
which a flip of the spatial orientation of the vortices with respect to the
position of the electrons is observed. Only when we limit ourselves to the
lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation the flip appears through the formation
of an intermediate giant vortex at specific values of the screening length.
Beyond the LLL approximation antivortices appear in the internal structure of
the intermediate composite fermions which prevent the nucleation of giant
vortices. We also studied the system of five electrons and show that the
mechanism of the flip of the vortex orientation found for three-electron system
is reproduced for higher number of electrons.

playground where one can study electroweak symmetry breaking. The nicest
feature is that gauge symmetry itself protects the Higgs potential from
divergences, thus potentially curing the hierarchy problem in the Standard
Model. In a flat space model tree-level contributions to electroweak precision
observables will be absent due to the flatness of the gauge and Higgs wave
functions. The Higgs potential is fully radiatively generated and the
contribution of bulk fermions will induce a vacuum expectation value. A generic
problem is that the quartic scalar coupling is too low, resulting in a Higgs
VEV that is too close to the compactification scale, and a Higgs mass that is
too light. In this paper we show that it is possible to solve these problems in
a minimal scenario by cancellations in the Higgs potential between the
contribution of different bulk fermions. A crucial role is played by
antiperiodic fermions: the cancellation is not the result of a fine tuning, but
rather dictated by the choice of representations and parities of the fermions.
We also show that introducing a relatively large representation can help in
achieving a sufficiently heavy top. In this case, the strong coupling scale is
lowered to a marginally acceptable value, and a more careful analysis of two
loop effects should decide if the theory remains under perturbative control.

recent mathematical results to incorporate the B-field and by decoupling the
dilaton, we are able to describe the 1-loop beta-functions of the metric and
B-field as the components of the gradient of a potential functional on the
space of coupling constants. We emphasize a special choice of diffeomorphism
gauge generated by the lowest eigenfunction of a certain Schrodinger operator
whose potential and kinetic terms evolve along the flow. With this choice, the
potential functional is the corresponding lowest eigenvalue, and gives the
order alpha' correction to the Weyl anomaly at fixed points of (g(t),B(t)).
Since the lowest eigenvalue is monotonic along the flow and reproduces the Weyl
anomaly at fixed points, it accords with the c-theorem for flows that remain
always in the first-order regime. We compute the Hessian of the lowest
eigenvalue functional and use it to discuss the linear stability of points
where the 1-loop beta-functions vanish, such as flat tori and K3 manifolds.

algebra associated with the automorphism group G. We check this result for
several concrete cases. In particular, we find that two NIM-reps of the fusion
algebra for $su(3)_k (k=3,5)$ are organized into a NIM-rep of the generalized
fusion algebra for the charge-conjugation automorphism of $su(3)_k$. We point
out that the generalized fusion algebra is non-commutative if G is non-abelian
and provide some examples for $G = S_3$. Finally, we give an argument that the
graph fusion algebra associated with simple current extensions coincides with
the generalized fusion algebra for the extended chiral algebra, and thereby
explain that the graph fusion algebra contains the fusion algebra of the
extended theory as a subalgebra.

having an extremely high quality factor. Typically, these arrays consist of
metal elements which have significantly high light absorption thus restricting
performance. In this paper we address the following question: can bound modes
be formed in dielectric systems where the absorption of light is negligible?
Our investigation of circular arrays of spherical particles shows that (1) high
quality modes in an array of 10 or more particles can be attained at least for
a refractive index $n_{r}>2$, so optical materials like TiO$_{2}$ or GaAs can
be used; (2) the most bound modes have nearly transverse polarization
perpendicular to the circular plane; (3) in a particularly interesting case of
TiO$_{2}$ particles (rutile phase, $n_{r}=2.7$), the quality factor of the most
bound mode increases almost by an order of magnitude with the addition of 10
extra particles, while for particles made of GaAs the quality factor increases
by almost two orders of magnitude with the addition of ten extra particles. We
hope that this preliminary study will stimulate experimental investigations of
bound modes in low-dimensional arrays of dielectric particles.

corresponds to convergence to a flow-invariant linear subspace of the global

globally and exponentially. We also show that, under mild conditions, global
convergence to a concurrently synchronized regime is preserved under basic
system combinations such as negative feedback or hierarchies, so that stable
concurrently synchronized aggregates of arbitrary size can be constructed.
Robustnesss of stable concurrent synchronization to variations in individual

used to compare two alignments to each other. In the case where one of the
alignments is a reference alignment, the resulting accuracy measure improves
upon previous approaches, and provides a balanced assessment of the fidelity of
both matches and gaps. Furthermore, in the case where a reference alignment is
not available, we provide empirical evidence that the distance from an
alignment produced by one program to predicted alignments from other programs
can be used as a control for multiple alignment experiments. In particular, we
show that low accuracy alignments can be effectively identified and discarded.
We also show that in the case of pairwise sequence alignment, it is possible to
find an alignment that maximizes the expected value of our accuracy measure.
Unlike previous approaches based on expected accuracy alignment that tend to
maximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity, our method is able to
identify unalignable sequence, thereby increasing overall accuracy. In
addition, the algorithm allows for control of the sensitivity/specificity
tradeoff via the adjustment of a single parameter. These results are confirmed
with simulation studies that show that unalignable regions can be distinguished
from homologous, conserved sequences. Finally, we propose an extension of the
pairwise alignment method to multiple alignment. Our method, which we call
AMAP, outperforms existing protein sequence multiple alignment programs on
benchmark datasets. A webserver and software downloads are available at
