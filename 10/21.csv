investigate the evolution of density distribution in equal-mass mergers between
dark matter (DM) halos and multicomponent galaxies. The DM halo models are
constructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps
to core-like profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models are
motivated by the LCDM paradigm of structure formation. The adopted force
resolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the
virial radii of the simulated systems. We demonstrate that the central slopes
and overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical to
those of the initial systems suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkable
memory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxation
that accompanies merger activity. We also find that halo concentrations remain
approximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systems
and show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass well
beyond their formal virial radii. These conclusions hold for a wide variety of
initial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounter
configurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneous
mergers of severals ystems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryonic
components in the form of disks, spheroids, or both. As an immediate
consequence, the net effect of gas cooling, which contracts and steepens the
inner density profiles of DM halos, should be preserved through a period of
dissipationless major merging. Our results imply that the characteristic
universal shape of DM density profiles may be set early in the evolution of
halos.

parameters of the source, we derived the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
the dust continuum by analysing data from the 2MASS survey, HIRAS, MSX, the
Spitzer Space Telescope, and interferometric 3mm observations. The SED was
modelled in a radiative transfer program: a) the stellar luminosity equals 1200
L_sun corresponding to a ZAMS star of 8 M_sun; b) the bulk of the envelope has
a temperature of 19 K; c) the mass of the remnant protostellar cloud in an area
8x10^17 cm or 15 arcsec across amounts to 500M_sun, if assuming standard dust
of the diffuse medium, and to about 60 M_sun, should the grains be fluffy and

few hundred magnitudes. The near IR data can be explained by scattering from
tenuous material above a hypothetical disk. The class II methanol maser lines
are spread out in velocity over 11 km/s. To explain the kinematics of the
masing spots, we propose that they are located in a Kepler disk at a distance
of about 250 AU. The dust temperatures there are around 150 K, high enough to

galaxy formation, highlighting recent insights obtained from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations. Detailed examination of gas accretion processes show
a hot mode of gas cooling from near the halo's virial temperature, and a
previously underappreciated cold mode where gas flows in along filaments on
dynamical timescales, emitting its energy in line radiation. Cold mode
dominates in systems with halo masses slightly smaller than the Milky Way and
below, and hence dominates the global accretion during the heydey of galaxy
formation. This rapid accretion path enables prompt assembly of massive
galaxies in the early universe, and results in $z\sim 4$ galaxy properties in
broad agreement with observations, with the most massive galaxies being the
most rapid star formers. Massive galaxies today are forming stars at a much
reduced rate, a trend called downsizing. The trend of downsizing is naturally
reproduced in simulations, owing to a transition from cold mode accretion in
the early growth phase to slower hot mode accretion once their halos grow
large. However, massive galaxies at the present epoch are still observed to
have considerably redder colors than simulations suggest, suggesting that star
formation is not sufficiently truncated in models by the transition to hot
mode, and that another process not included in current simulations is required
to suppress star formation.

associated with the supershell surrounding the luminous SNR candidate 41.9+58,

and outflow processes on a variety of timescales ranging from hours to weeks to
years. The most dramatic changes are seen for 2M1207, 2M1101 and ChaI-ISO217.
We observe possible accretion rate changes by about an order of magnitude in
two of these objects, over timescales of weeks (2M1207) or hours (2M1101). The
accretion 'burst' seen in 2M1101 could be due to a 'clumpy' flow. We also see
indications for changes in the outflow rate in at least three objects. In one
case (ISO217), there appears to be a ~1-hour time lag between outflow and
accretion variations, consistent with a scenario in which the wind originates
from the inner disk edge. Our variability study supports a close to edge-on
inclination for the brown dwarf LS-RCrA 1. The fact that all targets in our
sample show variations in accretion and/or outflow indicators suggests that
studies of young brown dwarf properties should be based either on large samples
or time series. As an example, we demonstrate that the large scatter in the
recently found accretion rate vs. mass relationship can be explained primarily
with variability. The observed profile variations imply asymmetric accretion
flows in brown dwarfs, which, in turn, is evidence for magnetic funneling by
large-scale fields. We show that accreting sub-stellar objects may harbor
magnetic fields with ~kG strength (abridged).

as the corresponding lines from helium. We give an approximate formula for the
strength of the main recombination line distortion on the CMB in different

previously undescribed long wavelength peak (which we call the
pre-recombination peak) from the lines of the 2p-1s transitions, which are
formed before significant recombination of the corresponding atoms occurred.
Detailed calculations of the two-photon emission line shapes are presented here
for the first time. The frequencies of the photons emitted from the two-photon
transition have a wide spectrum and this causes the location of the peak of the
two-photon line of hydrogen to be located almost at the same wavelength as the
main Ly-alpha peak. The helium lines also give distortions at similar
wavelengths, so that the combined distortion has a complex shape. The detection
of this distortion would provide direct supporting evidence that the Universe
was indeed once a plasma. Moreover, the distortions are a sensitive probe of
physics during the time of recombination. Although the spectral distortion is
overwhelmed by dust emission from the Galaxy, and is maximum at wavelengths
roughly where the cosmic far-infrared background peaks, it may be able to
tailor an experiment to detect its non-trivial shape.

chemical model that explores the possibility that the icy mantles are
photo-desorbed by FUV (6eV < h nu < 13.6eV) photons. We show that the average
Interstellar FUV field is enough to create a layer of water vapor above the
disk midplane over the entire disk. Assuming a photo-desorption yield of
10^{-3}, the water abundance in this layer is predicted to be ~ 3 x 10^{-7} and
the average H2O column density is ~ 1.6x 10^{15} cm^{-2}. The predictions are
very weakly dependent on the details of the model, like the incident FUV
radiation field, and the gas density in the disk. Based on this model, we
predict a gaseous HDO/H2O ratio in DM Tau of ~1%. In addition, we predict the
ground state transition of water at 557 GHz to be undetectable with ODIN and/or

lower than predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis with the baryon
density inferred from the cosmic microwave background. Interestingly, 6Li is
detected in nine of our 24 stars at the >2sigma significance level. Our
observations suggest the existence of a 6Li plateau at the level of log 6Li =

pre-main sequence evolution tilts the plateau such that the 6Li abundances
apparently increase with metallicity. Our most noteworthy result is the
detection of 6Li in the very metal-poor star LP815-43. Such a high 6Li
abundance during these early Galactic epochs is very difficult to achieve by
Galactic cosmic ray spallation and alpha-fusion reactions. It is concluded that
both Li isotopes have a pre-Galactic origin. Possible 6Li production channels
include proto-galactic shocks and late-decaying or annihilating supersymmetric
particles during the era of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The presence of 6Li
limits the possible degree of stellar 7Li depletion and thus sharpens the
discrepancy with standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis.

the current deep extragalactic surveys performed in the far-infrared with $\it
Spitzer$, and at radio wavelengths with the VLA. Our models fit the number
counts in all the available spectral bands well, and also provide a reasonably
close match to the redshift distribution of the $\it Spitzer$ detections. We
find: 1.) dusty starburst galaxies with infrared burst phases triggered by
galactic interactions at redshift $z \sim 1-2$ are good candidates to fit the
$\it Spitzer$ results at $24\mu m$, $70 \mu m$ and $160 \mu m$, assuming
plausible strengths for the PAH features for the infrared luminous sources. An
Arp220-like spectral energy distribution (SED) for Ultraluminous Infrared
Galaxies (ULIGs) of $L_{\rm ir}>10^{12} L_{\odot}$ and one like that of M82 for
Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIGs) of $L_{\rm ir}\sim 10^{11-12} L_{\odot}$ give
a successful fit to the $\it Spitzer$ $24\mu m$ and $\rm ISOCAM 15\mu m$ number
counts at flux levels of $S_{\nu}< 1 mJy$; 2.) the strong evolution of the
number density of the ULIGs from redshift $z\sim 0$ to $\sim 1$ predicted by
our models is consistent with the current deep $\rm 1.4 GHz$ radio surveys and
accounts for the upturn in the $\rm 1.4 GHz$ differential counts at the sub-mJy
flux level; and 3.) comparing with number counts at near infrared bands, as
well as the background measurements using DIRBE and 2MASS, shows that only a
fraction of the stellar mass in the Universe is included in our models of dusty
starburst mergers at $z \sim 1 - 2$.

HDO are used to study the chemistry of water in eight regions of high-mass star
formation. The spectra indicate HDO excitation temperatures of ~110 K and
column densities in an 11'' beam of ~2x10^14 cm^-2 for HDO and ~2x10^17 cm^-2
for H2O, with the N(HDO)/N(H2O) ratio increasing with decreasing temperature.
Simultaneous observations of CH3OH and SO2 indicate that 20-50% of the
single-dish line flux arises in the molecular outflows of these objects. The
outflow contribution to the H2O-18 and HDO emission is estimated to be 10-20%.
Radiative transfer models indicate that the water abundance is low (~10^-6)
outside a critical radius corresponding to a temperature in the protostellar
envelope of ~100 K, and `jumps' to H2O/H2 ~ 10^-4 inside this radius. This
value corresponds to the observed abundance of solid water and together with
the derived HDO/H2O abundance ratios of ~1/1000 suggests that the origin of the
observed water is evaporation of grain mantles. This idea is confirmed in the
case of AFGL 2591 by interferometer observations of HDO, H2O-18 and SO2 lines,
which reveal compact (~800 AU) emission with a systematic velocity gradient.
This size is similar to that of the 1.3 mm continuum towards AFGL 2591, from
which we estimate a mass of ~0.8 M0, or ~5% of the mass of the central star. We
speculate that we may be observing a circumstellar disk in an almost face-on
orientation.

continuum variations, while the broad emission lines display obvious changes in

not see any significant differences between the continuum and emission line
flux ratios of images A and B of the quasar. Spatial deconvolution of the HST

the problem of decoherence in weak localization. The basic challenge addressed
in our work is to calculate the decoherence of electrons interacting with a
quantum-mechanical environment, while taking proper account of the Pauli
principle. First, we review the usual influence functional approach valid for
decoherence of electrons due to classical noise, showing along the way how the
quantitative accuracy can be improved by properly averaging over closed (rather
than unrestricted) random walks. We then use a heuristic approach to show how
the Pauli principle may be incorporated into a path-integral description of
decoherence in weak localization. This is accomplished by introducing an
effective modification of the quantum noise spectrum, after which the
calculation proceeds in analogy to the case of classical noise. Using this
simple but efficient method, which is consistent with much more laborious
diagrammatic calculations, we demonstrate how the Pauli principle serves to
suppress the decohering effects of quantum fluctuations of the environment, and
essentially confirm the classic result of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii
for the energy-averaged decoherence rate, which vanishes at zero temperature.
Going beyond that, we employ our method to calculate explicitly the leading
quantum corrections to the classical decoherence rates, and to provide a
detailed analysis of the energy-dependence of the decoherence rate. The basic
idea of our approach is general enough to be applicable to decoherence of
degenerate Fermi systems in contexts other than weak localization as well. --
Paper II will provide a more rigorous diagrammatic basis for our results, by
rederiving them from a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the Cooperon.

Landau-Zener tunneling at the charge degeneracy, while the arms of the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer in energy space are represented by the ground and

system size decreases relaxation times are found to increase in accordance with
previous results in finite-size simulations and confined liquids. It has been
suggested that this increase may be related to a modification of the
cooperative motions in confined liquids. In agreement with this hypothesis we
observe a decrease of the dynamical heterogeneities associated to the most and
the least mobile atoms when the size L decreases. However we find that the
decrease of the dynamical aggregation associated to the least mobile atoms is
much more important than the decrease associated to the most mobile atoms. This
result is surprising as the liquid is slowed down. The decrease of the
heterogeneous behavior is also in contradiction with the increase of the

of the non-Gaussian parameter appears both in nanopores and in the finite size

heterogeneities, the increase of the non-Gaussian parameter together with a
decrease of dynamical heterogeneity is also surprising.

with the interactions in the forward-scattering channels, while renormalization
group methods are used to analyze the low-energy instabilities. In this

conditions where the nanotubes are assembled into large three-dimensional

momentum-transfer. We find that the destabilization of the normal metallic
behavior takes place through the onset of critical behavior in some of the two
charge stiffnesses that characterize the Luttinger liquid state. From a
physical point of view, this results in either a divergent compressibility or a
vanishing renormalized velocity for current excitations at the point of the

time. It is shown that this may be achieved in a causal, indeed instantaneous
fashion. In the second scenario, only the receiver has perfect knowledge of the
channel realization, while the transmitter has knowledge of the channel gain
probability law. In this case we determine an optimality condition on the input
covariance for ergodic Gaussian vector channels with arbitrary channel
distribution under the condition that the channel gains are independent of the
transmit signal. Using this optimality condition, we find an iterative
algorithm for numerical computation of optimal input covariance matrices.

possess this symmetry. As a consequence, when the global symmetry is broken the
Higgs fields emerge as light pseudo-Goldstone bosons, but with sizable quartic
self-interactions. This structure allows the cutoff scale, \Lambda, to be
raised to the multi-TeV region without significant fine-tuning. In the minimal

hole -- commonly referred to as Hod's conjecture -- has received considerable
attention. To test this conjecture, using monodromy technique, attempts have
been made to analytically compute the asymptotic frequencies for a large class
of black hole spacetimes. In an earlier work, two of the current authors
computed the high frequency QNMs for scalar perturbations of $(D+2)$
dimensional spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, single horizon
spacetimes with generic power-law singularities. In this work, we extend these
results to asymptotically non-flat spacetimes. Unlike the earlier analyses, we
treat asymptotically flat and de Sitter spacetimes in a unified manner, while
the asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetimes is considered separately. We obtain
master equations for the asymptotic QNM frequency for all the three cases. We
show that for all the three cases, the real part of the asymptotic QNM
frequency -- in general -- is not proportional to ln(3) thus indicating that
the Hod's conjecture may be restrictive.

to the fact that they reflect the properties of conservation laws. The closed
exterior forms correspond to the conservation laws for physical fields, whereas
the evolutionary forms correspond to the conservation laws for material media.
  Skew-symmetric differential forms can describe a conjugacy of any objects
(that correspond to the conservation laws). The closed exterior forms describe
conjugated objects. And the evolutionary forms, whose basis are deforming
manifolds, describe the process of conjugating objects and obtaining conjugated
objects. From the evolutionary forms the closed exterior forms are obtained.
  This shows that material media generate physical fields. The relation between
evolutionary and closed exterior forms discloses the relation between the
equations of mathematical physics and field theories. This explains the field
theory postulates.
  Conjugacy is possible if there is symmetry. Symmetries of closed exterior
forms, which are conditions of fulfilment of the conservation laws for physical
fields, are interior symmetries of field theories. And symmetries of dual forms
(due to the degrees of freedom of material media) are external symmetries of
the equations of field theories. This shows connection between internal and

be repaired by reducing the coefficients (which lie in (1/6)Z) of the

8Z.
  An analogous issue arises in considering the effect of orientation reversal

  While an invariant of smooth 4-manifolds is obtained by the repaired

  A more subtle approach to restoring invariance, using an action of an

interplay of phenotypic variation and natural selection through ecological
interactions. Our models are rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description
of a population of discrete individuals characterized by one or several
adaptive traits. The population is modelled as a stochastic point process whose
generator captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth,
mutation, and death, as influenced by each individual's trait values, and
interactions between individuals. An offspring usually inherits the trait
values of her progenitor, except when a mutation causes the offspring to take
an instantaneous mutation step at birth to new trait values. We look for
tractable large population approximations. By combining various scalings on
population size, birth and death rates, mutation rate, mutation step, or time,
a single microscopic model is shown to lead to contrasting macroscopic limits,
of different nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or
partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial
differential equations or superprocesses. In the limit of rare mutations, we
show that a possible approximation is a jump process, justifying rigorously the
so-called trait substitution sequence. We thus unify different points of view
concerning mutation-selection evolutionary models.

larger than unity (2 =< Sc =< 32). The simulations resolve below the Batchelor
scale up to a factor of four. The advecting turbulence is homogeneous and
isotropic, and maintained stationary by stochastic forcing at low wavenumbers.
The passive scalar is rendered stationary by a mean scalar gradient in one
direction. The relation between geometrical and statistical properties of
scalar field and its gradients is examined. The Reynolds numbers and Schmidt
numbers are not large enough for either the Kolmogorov scaling or the Batchelor
scaling to develop and, not surprisingly, we find no fractal scaling of scalar
level sets, or isosurfaces, in the intermediate viscous range. The
area-to-volume ratio of isosurfaces reflects the nearly Gaussian statistics of
the scalar fluctuations. The scalar flux across the isosurfaces, which is
determined by the conditional probability density function (PDF) of the scalar
gradient magnitude, has a stretched exponential distribution towards the tails.
The PDF of the scalar dissipation departs distinctly, for both small and large
amplitudes, from the lognormal distribution for all cases considered. The joint
statistics of the scalar and its dissipation rate, and the mean conditional
moment of the scalar dissipation, are studied as well. We examine the effects
of coarse-graining on the probability density to simulate the effects of poor

framework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others
guess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of
future physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will
designate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic
views of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast
each of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not
all interpretations of physics. We argue that this diversity in the physics

autofluorescence spectrum into the spectra of naturally occurring biochemical
components of biotissue. It requires knowledge of detailed spectrum behaviour
of different endogenous fluorophores. We have studied the main bio-markers in
human tissue and proposed a simple modelling algorithm for their spectra
shapes. The empirical method was tested theoretically by quantum-mechanical
calculations of the spectra in the unharmonic Morse potential approach.

linear optics, either based upon a static linear array or including conditional
dynamics. In our approach, a given POVM shall be identified as a solution to an
optimization problem for a chosen cost function. We formulate a general
principle: the implementation is only possible if a linear-optics circuit
exists for which the quantum mechanical optimum (minimum) is still attainable
after dephasing the corresponding quantum states. The general principle enables
us, for instance, to derive a set of necessary conditions for the linear-optics
implementation of the POVM that realizes the quantum mechanically optimal
unambiguous discrimination of two pure nonorthogonal states. This extends our
previous results on projection measurements and the exact discrimination of
orthogonal states.

a relaxation with complex frequencies whose imaginary parts are damping rates
quadratic in the coupling to the environment, in accord with Fermi's ``Golden
Rule''. We show for various models (spin damped by harmonic-oscillator or
random-matrix baths, quantum diffusion, quantum Brownian motion) that upon
increasing the coupling up to a critical value still small enough to allow for
weak-coupling Markovian master equations, a new relaxation regime can occur. In
that regime, complex frequencies lose their real parts such that the process
becomes overdamped. Our results call into question the standard belief that
overdamping is exclusively a strong coupling feature.

known as polarization self-rotation (PSR), has been suggested as a mechanism
for producing squeezed light at atomic transition wavelengths. In this paper,
we show results of the characterization of PSR in isotopically enhanced
Rubidium-87 cells, performed in two independent laboratories. We observed that,
contrary to earlier work, the presence of atomic noise in the thermal vapour
overwhelms the observation of squeezing. We present a theory that contains
atomic noise terms and show that a null result in squeezing is consistent with
this theory.

the violation of Bell's inequalities can only be understood if this freedom is

to be abandoned, if one wants to keep such a picture and be in agreement with
the experiment. Furthermore, the freedom in choosing experimental arrangements
may be considered as a resource, since its lacking can be used by an
eavesdropper to harm the security of quantum communication. We analyze the
security of quantum key distribution as a function of the (partial) knowledge
the eavesdropper has about the future choices of measurement settings which are
made by the authorized parties (e.g. on the basis of some quasi-random
generator). We show that the equivalence between the violation of Bell's
inequality and the efficient extraction of a secure key - which exists for the
case of complete freedom (no setting knowledge) - is lost unless one adapts the
bound of the inequality according to this lack of freedom.
