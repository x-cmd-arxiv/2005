of Newtonian gravity have been successfully in reproducing some dynamical
properties of galaxies. More recently, a relativistic formulation of MOND
proposed by Bekenstein seems to agree with cosmological large scale structure
formation. In this work, we revise the agreement of MOND with observations in
light of the new results on the Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies provided by the
2003 flight of Boomerang. The measurements of the height of the third acoustic
peak, provided by several small scale CMB experiments have reached enough
sensitivity to severely constrain models without cold dark matter. Assuming
that acoustic peak structure in the CMB is unchanged and that local
measurements of the Hubble constant can be applied, we find that the cold dark
matter is strongly favoured with Bayesian probability ratio of about one in two
hundred.

mass distribution compared to the luminous matter and can be used to test the
existence of a population of small galaxies in which the star formation has
been partially or completely suppressed during cosmic evolution. Due to
technical limitations, the existing HI surveys are not very sensitive to HI
masses below 10^8 M_sun. We designed a blind HI survey to be sensitive to
objects with small HI masses. The surveyed area is in the Canis Venatici groups
of galaxies and covers in total ~ 86 deg^2 of sky, with observed velocities in
the range -350 < cz < 1400 km/s. We detected 69 objects, 22 of them for the
first time in HI. All new HI detections fall in the lower part of the
mass-histogram, confirming our ability to detect galaxies with small HI masses.
The calculated HIMF is flat in the faint end regime (slope ~ -1), different
from the steep rise predicted by CDM models. Possible effects of the
environment on the estimated HIMF parameters are discussed.

also have an important contribution from the first stars, which may have formed
before galaxy formation began. Direct measurements are difficult and not yet
conclusive, owing to the large uncertainties caused by the bright foreground
emission associated with zodiacal light. An alternative approach is to study
the absorption features imprinted on the gamma-ray spectra of distant
extragalactic objects by interactions of those photons with the background
light photons. Here we report the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the
blazars H 2356-309 and 1ES 1101-232, at redshifts z=0.165 and z=0.186,
respectively. Their unexpectedly hard spectra provide an upper limit on the
background light at optical/near-infrared wavelengths that appears to be very
close to the lower limit given by the integrated light of resolved galaxies.
The background flux at these wavelengths accordingly seems to be strongly
dominated by the direct starlight from galaxies, thus excluding a large
contribution from other sources -- in particular from the first stars formed.
This result also indicates that intergalactic space is more transparent to
gamma-rays than previously thought.

galaxies, HI mass functions, galaxy sizes, faint galaxy number counts and
photometric redshift distributions in optical pass-bands, isophotal angular
sizes, and cosmic star formation rates. In particular, the strong supernova

spherical or a slab-like corona, by comparing the inferred parameters with
independent direct measurements. While all models give an adequate description
of the spectra, we find a significant discrepancy between the MCD+PL inferred
X-ray-absorbing gas column density and the absorption-edge measurement based on
dispersed X-ray spectra. The MCD+PL fits to the LMC X-1 spectra also require a
change in the inner disk radius during the BeppoSAX observation, which may be
due to the nonphysical effects inherited in the model. In contrast, the CMCD
model with the spheric corona gives the predictions of both the disk
inclination angle and the absorption that are consistent with the direct
measurements, and only slightly under-predicts the black hole mass of LMC X-3.
The model explains the spectral state evolution of LMC X-1 within the BeppoSAX
observation as a change in the accretion rate, which leads to an increase in
both the inner disk temperature and the Comptonization opacity. On the other
hand, the CMCD model with the slab-like corona is more problematic in the test

influence radiation from the reverse-shock heated GRB ejecta. We find that
optical/IR flux depends very weakly on the number of pairs in the ejecta, and
there is no unique signature of ejecta pair enrichment if observations are
confined to a single wavelength band. It may be possible to determine if the
number of pairs per proton in the ejecta is > 100 by using observations in
optical and radio bands; the ratio of flux in the optical and radio at the peak
of each respective reverse-shock light curve is dependent on the number of
pairs per proton. We also find that over a large parameter space, RS emission
is expected to be very weak; GRB 990123 seems to have been an exceptional burst
in that only a very small fraction of the parameter space produces optical
flashes this bright. Also, it is often the case that the optical flux from the
forward shock is brighter than the reverse shock flux at deceleration. This
could be another possible reason for the paucity of prompt optical flashes with
a rapidly declining light curve at early times as was seen in 990123 and

separation theta > 10 arcsec. The clustering strength of z~4, 5 LBGs also
depends on the rest-frame UV luminosity, with brighter galaxies more strongly
clustered than fainter ones, implying a general correlation between halos' mass
and LBGs' star-formation rate. At smaller separations, w(theta) of deep samples
significantly exceeds the extrapolation of the large-scale power-law fit,

bright LBGs statistically have more faint companions on scales theta < 20

very likely due to sub-structure, namely the fact that massive halos can host
multiple galaxies. A simple model for the halo occupation distribution and the
CDM halo mass function reproduce well the observed w(theta). The scaling
relationship of the clustering strength with volume density and with redshift
is quantitatively consistent with that of CDM halos. A comparison of the
clustering strength of three samples of equal luminosity limit at z ~ 3, 4 and

not selected photometrically are selected kinematically; our candidate samples
are likely to be very pure. We take considerable care in assessing the
contaminating background level in our photometric sample to ensure accurate
density profiles. These assessments verify that we detect a considerable
stellar density of Sculptor stars to the limits of our survey area in both the
RGB and BHB samples. We find the Sculptor density profile is well-fit by a King
profile of limiting radius r_{lim} = 79.6 within ~60 arcmin, beyond which a

bound group of ""halo stars"" around the Sculptor dSph or unbound tidal debris.

fractional mass-loss rate of ~0.042 Gyr^{-1} for Sculptor. Finally, likely more

slower shock velocities. For all remnants, the [S II]6716/6731 ratio indicates
electron densities below 600 cm^{-3} with particularly low densities for G

minor outburst of the star in early July 2004 and quiescence variations on 19
nights scattered over six months. During the outburst, the star peaked
approximately 3 magnitudes brighter than usual, and our spectra were dominated
by broad hydrogen, helium and iron emission lines. The very first spectra
showed P Cygni profiles, which disappeared within a few hours, indicating rapid
changes in matter ejection. The H-alpha line had multiple components, one being
a broad blue-shifted wing exceeding 5000 km/s. During a simultaneously observed
10-min photometric flare-up, the equivalent width of the H-alpha line
temporarily decreased, implying that it was a flare of the continuum. The
overall spectral appearance was similar to that observed in the 1999 September
active phase, which suggests that similar mass-ejection processes were
associated with both eruptions. In quiescence, the spectra were those of the
early-type secondary star showing its orbital motion around the primary. By
measuring cross-correlation radial velocities, we give an improved set of
spectroscopic elements. Whereas we measure the same velocity amplitude
(K_2=211.3+/-1.0 km/s), within errors, as Orosz et al. (2001), our
centre-of-mass velocity (v_gamma=72.7+/-3.3 km/s) differs significantly from
the previously published value (107.4+/-m2.9 km/s). However, we find evidence
that the difference is caused by a systematic error in data reduction in the
previous study, rather than by gravitational effects of an invisible third

profiles obtained by cross correlation of the stellar spectra with a mask made
from suitable lines of a solar catalog. Bisector velocity spans were then
determined: errors in these quantities compare well with theoretical
expectations based on resolution, S/N and line shape. The plot of bisector
velocity span against radial velocity was studied to search for correlations
between line asymmetries and radial velocity variations. A correlation was seen
for HD 166435 due to stellar activity, and for HD 8071B due to spectral
contamination by the companion. No correlation was seen for 51 Peg and rho CrB,

separate radial velocity variations due to barycenter motion from spurious

be confined within the cluster volume for cosmological times, so that the rate

correspondingly enhanced. If MHD waves are present, as it may be expected in
the case of a recent merger event, then the reacceleration of secondary

The mass loss by galactic winds is obtained by calculating transonic solutions
of steady state outflows, driven by thermal, cosmic ray and MHD wave pressure.
The inhomogeneities in the metal distribution caused by these processes are an
ideal tool to reveal the dynamical state of a galaxy cluster. We present
surface brightness, X-ray emission weighted temperature and metal maps of our
model clusters as they would be observed by X-ray telescopes like XMM-Newton.
We show that X-ray weighted metal maps distinguish between pre- or post-merger
galaxy clusters by comparing the metallicity distribution with the
galaxy-density distribution: pre-mergers have a metallicity gap between the
subclusters, post-mergers a high metallicity between subclusters. We apply our
approach to two observed galaxy clusters, Abell 3528 and Abell 3921, to show
whether they are pre- or post-merging systems. The survival time of the
inhomogeneities in the metallicity distribution found in our simulations is up
to several Gyr. We show that galactic winds and merger-driven starbursts enrich

M51. Recent studies have confirmed that star clusters do not form in isolation,
but instead tend to form in larger groupings or complexes. We use {\it HST}
broad and narrow band images (from both {\it WFPC2} and {\it ACS}), along with
{\it BIMA}-CO observations to study the properties and investigate the origin
of the e complexes. We find that the complexes are all young ($< 10$ Myr), have
sizes between $\sim$85 and $\sim$240 pc, and have masses between 3-30 $\times
10^{4} M_{\odot}$. Unlike that found for isolated young star clusters, we find
a strong correlation between the complex mass and radius, namely $M\propto
R^{2.33 \pm 0.19}$. This is similar to that found for giant molecular clouds
(GMCs). By comparing the mass-radius relation of GMCs in M51 to that of the
complexes we can estimate the star formation efficiency within the complexes,
although this value is heavily dependent on the assumed CO-to-H$_2$ conversion
factor. The complexes studied here have the same surface density distribution
as individual young star clusters and GMCs. If star formation within the
complexes is proportional to the gas density at that point, then the shared
mass-radius relation of GMCs and complexes is a natural consequence of their
shared density profiles. We briefly discuss possibilities for the lack of a
mass-radius relation for young star clusters. We note that many of the
complexes show evidence of merging of star clusters in their centres,
suggesting that larger star clusters can be produced through the build up of
smaller clusters.

(injection and extraction sites) separated by a distance r in two-dimensional
lattices of size L. Our results for the non-trapping invasion percolation model
indicate that the statistics of the mass of invaded clusters is significantly
dependent on the local occupation probability (pressure) Pe at the extraction
site. For Pe=0, we show that the mass distribution of invaded clusters P(M)
follows a power-law P(M) ~ M^{-\alpha} for intermediate values of the mass M,
with an exponent \alpha=1.39. When the local pressure is set to Pe=Pc, where Pc
corresponds to the site percolation threshold of the lattice topology, the
distribution P(M) still displays a scaling region, but with an exponent
\alpha=1.02. This last behavior is consistent with previous results for the
cluster statistics in standard percolation. In spite of these discrepancies,
the results of our simulations indicate that the fractal dimension of the
invaded cluster does not depends significantly on the local pressure Pe and it
is consistent with the fractal dimension values reported for standard invasion
percolation. Finally, we perform extensive numerical simulations to determine
the effect of the lattice borders on the statistics of the invaded clusters and
also to characterize the self-organized critical behavior of the invasion
percolation process.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 140405 (2004)]. Exploiting the formal similarities
with sum frequency generation and using quantum optics methods we consider the
cases where the molecules are formed from atoms out of two Bose-Einstein
condensates, out of a Bose-Einstein condensate and a gas of degenerate
fermions, and out of two degenerate Fermi gases with and without superfluidity.
Bosons are treated in a single mode approximation and fermions in a degenerate
model. In these approximations we can numerically solve the master equations
describing the system's dynamics and thus we find the full counting statistics
of the molecular modes. The full quantum dynamics calculations are complemented
by mean field calculations and short time perturbative expansions. While the
molecule production rates are very similar in all three cases at this level of
approximation, differences show up in the counting statistics of the molecular
fields. The intermediate field of closed-channel molecules is for short times
second-order coherent if the molecules are formed from two Bose-Einstein
condensates or a Bose-Fermi mixture. They show counting statistics similar to a
thermal field if formed from two normal Fermi gases. The coherence properties
of molecule formation in two superfluid Fermi gases are intermediate between
the two previous cases. In all cases the final field of deeply-bound molecules
is found to be twice as noisy as that of the intermediate state. This is a
consequence of its coupling to the lossy optical cavity in our model, which
acts as an input port for quantum noise, much like the situation in an optical
beam splitter.

special doping point P_q occurs naturally in the solutions that separates two
phases at temperature T = 0: a pure superconducting phase on one side (P > P_q)
and a phase with superconductivity strongly suppressed by antiferromagnetism on
the other (P < P_q). We interpret P_q as a quantum phase transition point.
Moreover, the pairing gap is found to have two solutions for P < P_q: a small
gap that is associated with competition between superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism and is responsible for the ground state superconductivity,
and a large gap without antiferromagnetic suppression that corresponds to a
collective excited state. A pseudogap appears in the solutions that terminates
at P_q and originates from the competition between d-wave superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism. Nevertheless, this conclusion does not contradict the
preformed pair picture conceptually if the preformed pairs are generally
defined as any pairs formed before pairing condensation.

intriguing properties. Having made use of the binary-fluid phase diagram to

Ehrenfest time the quantum systems display a degree of universality which is
well described by random-matrix theory. In the semiclassical limit, tau_E
becomes parametrically larger than the scattering time off the boundaries and
the dwell time in the system. This results in the emergence of an increasing
number of deterministic transport and escape modes, which induce strong
deviations from random-matrix universality. We discuss these deviations for a

distribution, and, in particular, on controlling and probing it. The
temperature of an electron gas is determined by this distribution:
refrigeration is equivalent to narrowing it, and thermometry is probing its
convolution with a function characterizing the measuring device. Temperature
exists, strictly speaking, only in quasiequilibrium in which the distribution
follows the Fermi-Dirac form. Interesting nonequilibrium deviations can occur
due to slow relaxation rates of the electrons, e.g., among themselves or with
lattice phonons. Observation and applications of nonequilibrium phenomena are
also discussed. The focus in this paper is at low temperatures, primarily below
4 K, where physical phenomena on mesoscopic scales and hybrid combinations of
various types of materials, e.g., superconductors, normal metals, insulators,
and doped semiconductors, open up a rich variety of device concepts. This
review starts with an introduction to theoretical concepts and experimental
results on thermal properties of mesoscopic structures. Then thermometry and
refrigeration are examined with an emphasis on experiments. An immediate
application of solid-state refrigeration and thermometry is in ultrasensitive
radiation detection, which is discussed in depth. This review concludes with a

the separation between dips in conductances for different spins and by allowing
perfect blocking for one spin direction and perfect transmission for the other.

theme in the software reuse literature is that if we can only get the right
environment in place-- the right tools, the right generalizations, economic
incentives, a ``culture of reuse'' -- then reuse of software will soar, with
consequent improvements in productivity and software quality. The analysis
developed in this paper paints a different picture: the extent to which
software reuse can occur is an intrinsic property of a problem domain, and
better tools and culture can have only marginal impact on reuse rates if the
domain is inherently resistant to reuse. We define an entropy parameter $H \in
[0,1]$ of problem domains that measures program diversity, and deduce from this
upper bounds on code reuse and the scale of components with which we may work.
For ``low entropy'' domains with $H$ near 0, programs are highly similar to one
another and the domain is amenable to the Component-Based Software Engineering
(CBSE) dream of programming by composing large-scale components. For problem
domains with $H$ near 1, programs require substantial quantities of new code,
with only a modest proportion of an application comprised of reused,
small-scale components. Preliminary empirical results from Unix platforms
support some of the predictions of our model.

between Wilson loops and electric fields are evaluated in order to measure the
penetration length in both gauges. The coherence length is shown to be fixed in
the MA gauge from measurements of the monopole density around the static
quark-antiquark pair. It is also shown numerically that a dimension 2 gluon
operator A^+A^-(s) and the monopole density has a strong correlation as
suggested theoretically. Such a correlation is observed also between the

U(1) gauge degree of freedom is fixed to U(1) Landau gauge (U1LA). The
coherence length is determined numerically also from correlations between

lengths in the two gauges are almost the same. The vacuum type of the
confinement phase in both gauges is near to the border between the type 1 and
the type 2 dual superconductors.

of commuting operators. To achieve this, we define and study the Hilbert space
analogs of Samuel multiplicities in commutative algebra. Then the theory is
applied to the symmetric Fock space. In particular, our results imply a
satisfactory answer to Arveson's program on developing a Fredholm theory for
pure $d$-contractions when $d=2$, including both the Fredholmness problem and
the calculation of indices. We also show that Arveson's curvature invariant is
in fact always equal to the Samuel multiplicity for an arbitrary pure
d-contraction with finite defect rank. It follows that the curvature is a
similarity invariant.

algebraic notion. More precisely, we produce level sets of points whose
Artinian reductions have socle types 3 and 4 and arbitrary socle degree $\geq
12$ (in the worst case), but fail to have WLP. We also produce a level set of
points whose Artinian reduction fails to have unimodal Hilbert function; our
example is based on Zanello's example. Finally, we show that a level set of
points can have Artinian reduction that has WLP but fails to have the Strong
Lefschetz Property. While our constructions are all based on basic double
G-linkage, the implementations use very different methods.

therefore do not have generalized homology invariants in the usual sense, they

mild hypotheses, a twisted parametrized spectrum will have cyclically graded
homology invariants and will also have K-theory and complex bordism invariants,
as expected for a Floer or semi-infinite homotopy type. We discuss the
association of a twist of parametrized homotopy theory to a polarized

union of all lines from both families is called a cage, and the intersection X
consists of d^2 points at which a line from the first family intersects a line

subsets A of the nodal set X such that any plane algebraic curve C of degree d

polygons (instead of hexagons as in Pascal's theorem) inscribed in a quadratic

are based on the complex biological reactions kinetic of various components.
These models are not practical because we lack of kinetic information. In this
paper, it is found that the enzymatic reaction and multi-order reaction rate is
often controlled by the transport of the reactants in biological systems. A
Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approach, which is based on transport of the
components and kinetics of biological reactions, is introduced for biological
system modeling. We apply this approach to a biological wastewater treatment
system for the study of metabolism of organic carbon substrates and the
population of microbial. The results show that CFD model coupled with reaction
kinetics is more accurate and more feasible than kinetic models for biological
system modeling.

ventral cluster of visual cortex maintains structurally more segregated, less

different roles of their constituent brain regions.

loopholes that might cause bias and hence, if the world does, after all, obey
local realism, no violation of a Bell inequality will be observed. Interest
centres around the question of whether or not the proposed criterion for
``non-classical'' light is valid. If cit is not, then the experiments will fail
in their initial concept, since both quantum theorists and local realists will
agree that we are seeing a purely classical effect. The Bell test, though, is
not the only criterion by which the quantum-mechanical and local realist models
can be judged. If the experiments are extended by including a range of
parameter values and by analysing, in addition to the proposed digitised
voltage differences, the raw voltages, the models can be compared in their
overall performance and plausibility.

still be designed to evolve only the selected qubit and keep the other qubit
unchanged; the rotation of the selected qubit depends on the state of the other
one. These conditional single-qubit operations allow to deterministically
generate the well-known Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs, represented by EPR-Bell

experimentally confirm the generation of these states. The decays of the

raises the hope to simulate the unitary quantum operationes generated by a

constructed of only 2-body interactions. That replacement would happen without
any additional gates, and its possibility would be due to the ambiguity of the

polynomial resources to simulate 1D quantum spin systems for logarithmic |t|.
The second consequence is that continuous-time 1D quantum circuits with
logarithmic |t| can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer, despite
the fact that, after discretisation, such circuits are of polynomial depth.
