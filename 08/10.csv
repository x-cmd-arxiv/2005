energy distribution (SED) from 23 micron to 1.3 mm requires a large inner
cavity of radius 600 AU in the envelope to avoid quenching the emission from
the central sources. This is consistent with a previous suggestion based on
high angular resolution millimeter interferometric data. An alternative
interpretation using a 2D model of the envelope with an outflow cavity can
reproduce the SED but not the interferometer visibilities. The cavity size is
comparable to the centrifugal radius of the envelope and therefore appears to
be a natural consequence of the rotation of the protostellar core, which has
also caused the fragmentation leading to the central protostellar binary. With
a large cavity such as required by the data, the average temperature at a given
radius does not increase above 60-80 K and although hot spots with higher
temperatures may be present close to each protostar, these constitute a small
fraction of the material in the inner envelope. The proposed cavity will also
have consequences for the interpretation of molecular line data, especially of
complex species probing high temperatures in the inner regions of the envelope.

correctly tracks the position of I-fronts at much lower resolutions than

focus on problem timestepping which if not properly implemented can lead to
morphologically plausible I-front behavior that nonetheless departs from

axial ratios for elliptical galaxies is similar to that seen locally,
suggesting that ellipticals relaxed quickly to a standardized shape. The
distribution of axial ratios for spiral galaxies is significantly different

to the 100 early-type galaxies observed in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey and the
elliptical galaxy NGC 4697. An analysis of the dependencies of the measured r_h
on both the properties of the GCs themselves and their host galaxies reveals
that the average r_h increases with increasing galactocentric distance or,
alternatively, with decreasing galaxy surface brightness. For the first time,
we find that the average r_h decreases with the host galaxy color. We also show
that there is no evidence for a variation of r_h with the luminosity of the
GCs. Finally, we find in agreement with previous observations that the average
r_h depends on the color of GCs, with red GCs being ~17% smaller than their
blue counterparts. We show that this difference is probably a consequence of an
intrinsic mechanism, rather than projection effects, and that it is in good
agreement with the mechanism proposed in Jordan (2004). We discuss these
findings in light of two simple pictures for the origin of the r_h of GCs and
show that both lead to a behavior in rough agreement with the observations.
After accounting for the dependencies found we show that the average GC
half-light radii <r_h> can be successfully used as a standard ruler for
distance estimation. We outline the methodology, and provide a calibration for
its use. We find <r_h> = 2.7 +- 0.35 pc for GCs with (g-z)=1.2 mag in a galaxy
with color (g-z)_{gal}=1.5 mag and at an underlying surface z-band brightness
of mu_z = 21 mag arcsec^{-2}. Using this technique, we place an upper limit of
3.4 Mpc on the 1-sigma line-of-sight depth of the Virgo Cluster. Finally, we
examine the form of the r_h distribution for our sample galaxies and provide an
analytic expression which successfully describes this distribution. (Abridged)

attempting to detect these variations in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. We
subdivide the simulation box in equal-density regions around clusters, which we
assume can be achieved by selecting objects at a given normalised distance
($r/r_{rms}$, where $r_{rms}$ is an estimate of the halo radius) from the group
centre. The semi-analytic model predicts important variations in the luminosity
function out to $r/r_{rms}\simeq5$. In brief, variations in the mass function
of haloes around clusters (large dark-matter haloes with
$M>10^{12}$h$^{-1}$M$_{\sun}$) lead to cluster central regions that present a
high abundance of bright galaxies (high $M^*$ values) as well as low luminosity
galaxies (high $\alpha$); at $r/r_{rms}\simeq 3$ there is a lack of bright
galaxies, which shows the depletion of galaxies in the regions surrounding
clusters (minimum in $M^*$ and $\alpha$), and a tendency to constant luminosity
function parameters at larger cluster-centric distances. We take into account
the observational biases present in the real data by reproducing the peculiar
velocity effect on the redshifts of galaxies in the simulation box, and also by
producing mock catalogues. We find that excluding from the analysis galaxies
wich in projection are close to the centres of the groups provides results that
are qualitatively consistent with the full simulation box results.

test the model against high-resolution, hydrodynamic cluster simulations to
gauge its reliability. We find that this simple prescription does a good job of
predicting the distribution of cluster X-ray ellipticities compared to the
simulations as long as one focuses on cluster regions that are less sensitive
to recent mergers. Based on this simple model, the distribution of cluster-size
halo shapes expected in the concordance LCDM cosmology implies an X-ray
ellipticity distribution with a mean of 0.32 +- 0.01 and a scatter of 0.14 +-

observational samples of cluster ellipticities and find that our results are

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement maps and find that it is less successful although
still useful; the model does not perform as well as a function of flux level in

host galaxy. By comparison with synthetic template spectra we determine the
photometric redshift of the GRB 981226 host to be z_phot = 1.11+/-0.06 (68%
confidence level). While the age-metallicity degeneracy for the host SED
complicates the determination of accurate ages, metallicity, and extinction,
the photometric redshift is robust. The inferred z_phot value is also robust
compared to a Bayesian redshift estimator which gives z_phot=0.94+/-0.13. The
characteristics for this host are similar to other GRB hosts previously
examined. Available low resolution spectra show no emission lines at the
expected wavelengths. The photometric redshift estimate indicates an isotropic
energy release consistent with the Amati relation for this GRB which had a
spectrum characteristic of an X-ray flash.

case (SAX J1819.3-2525/V4641 Sgr). We carried out a 20 ks Chandra ACIS-S
observation of IGR J17544-2619 which shows the source in quiescence going into
outburst. The Chandra position confirms the previous tentative identification
of the optical counterpart, a blue O9Ib supergiant at 3 to 4 kpc (Pellizza,
Chaty & Negueruela, in prep.). This is the first detection of a fast X-ray
transient in quiescence. The quiescent spectrum is very soft. The photon index
of 5.9+/-1.2 (90% confidence error margin) is much softer than 6 quiescent
black hole candidates that were observed with Chandra ACIS-S (Kong et al. 2002;
Tomsick et al. 2003). Assuming that a significant fraction of the quiescent
photons comes from the accretor and not the donor star, we infer that the
accretor probably is a neutron star. A fit to the quiescent spectrum of the
neutron star atmosphere model developed by Pavlov et al. (1992) and Zavlin et
al. (1996) implies an unabsorbed quiescent 0.5--10 keV luminosity of

unidirectional charge/spin density wave state of composite fermions is lower in
energy than the Wigner crystal. It means that transport anisotropy, similar to
those for electrons in higher Landau levels at half fillings, may take place at
this fractional quantum Hall state when the external magnetic field is in an
appropriate range. When the magnetic field is tilted an angle, the easy

based on a Bayesian formalism that is applicable to individual quantum systems.
Measurement continuously collapses the two-qubit system to one of the
sub-spaces of the Bell basis. For a detector with linear response this
corresponds to measurement of the total spin of the qubits. In the other
extreme of purely quadratic response the operator \sigma_y^1 \sigma_y^2 +
\sigma_z^1 \sigma_z^2 is measured. In both cases, collapse naturally leads to
spontaneous entanglement which can be identified by measurement of the power
spectrum and/or the average current of the detector. Asymmetry between the two
qubits results in evolution between the different measurement subspaces.
However, when the qubits are even weakly coupled to the detector, a kind of
quantum Zeno effect cancels the gradual evolution and replaces it with rare,
abrupt switching events. We obtain the asymptotic switching rates for these
events and confirm them with numerical simulations. We show how such switching
affects the observable power spectrum on different time scales.

of high-data-rate communication systems. Such channels have a large channel
memory length, but only a small number of significant channel coefficients. In
this paper, trellis-based equalization of sparse ISI channels is revisited. Due
to the large channel memory length, the complexity of maximum-likelihood
detection, e.g., by means of the Viterbi algorithm (VA), is normally
prohibitive. In the first part of the paper, a unified framework based on
factor graphs is presented for complexity reduction without loss of optimality.
In this new context, two known reduced-complexity algorithms for sparse ISI
channels are recapitulated: The multi-trellis VA (M-VA) and the
parallel-trellis VA (P-VA). It is shown that the M-VA, although claimed, does
not lead to a reduced computational complexity. The P-VA, on the other hand,
leads to a significant complexity reduction, but can only be applied for a
certain class of sparse channels. In the second part of the paper, a unified
approach is investigated to tackle general sparse channels: It is shown that
the use of a linear filter at the receiver renders the application of standard
reduced-state trellis-based equalizer algorithms feasible, without significant
loss of optimality. Numerical results verify the efficiency of the proposed
receiver structure.

allowed to possess a bulk viscosity, and find the noteworthy fact that
consistency of the formalism requires the bulk viscosity to be proportional to
the power (2\alpha -1) of the scalar expansion. In Einstein's gravity, where
\alpha=1, this means that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the scalar
expansion. This mathematical result is of physical interest; as discussed

transition of the fluid from the quintessence region into the phantom region,

are studied within the framework of QCD factorization. Although the light
scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ are widely perceived as primarily the
four-quark bound states, in practice it is difficult to make quantitative
predictions based on the four-quark picture for light scalars. Hence,
predictions are made in the 2-quark model for the scalar mesons. Based on the
QCD sum rule method, we have derived the leading-twist light-cone distribution
amplitudes of scalar mesons and their decay constants. The short-distance
approach suffices to explain the observed large rates of $f_0(980)K^-$ and
$f_0(980)\bar K^0$ that receive major penguin contributions from the $b\to
ss\bar s$ process. When $f_0(980)$ is assigned as a four-quark bound state,
there exist extra diagrams contributing to $B\to f_0(980)K$. Therefore, a
priori the $f_0(980)K$ rate is not necessarily suppressed for a four-quark
state $f_0(980)$. The calculated $\bar B^0\to a_0^+(980)\pi^-$ and
$a_0^+(980)K^-$ rates exceed slightly the current experimental limits. If the
branching ratio of $\bar B^0\to a_0^+(1450)\pi^-$ is measured at the level of
$(4\sim 6)\times 10^{-6}$ while $a_0^+(980)\pi^-$ is found to be smaller, say,
of order $(1\sim 2)\times 10^{-6}$ or even smaller than this, it will be likely
to imply a 2-quark nature for $a_0(1450)$ and a four-quark assignment for
$a_0(980)$. The penguin-dominated modes $a_0(980)K$ and $a_0(1450)K$ receive
dominant weak annihilation contributions.

in the energy range from 0.1 to 10 GeV show an excess for energies above 1 GeV
in comparison with the expectations from conventional galactic models. This
excess shows all the key features of Dark Matter Annihilation (DMA), like being
observable in al sky directions with a shape corresponding to a WIMP mass
between 50 and 100 GeV. The intensity of the excess in various directions can
be used to reconstruct the DM profile, which - combined with the distribution
of visible matter - allows to calculate the rotation curve of our Galaxy. Its
peculiar shape, which is not flat, but shows a minimum and maximum, is indeed
reconstructed from the gamma rays, thus proving that the EGRET excess traces
the DM. Furthermore, the spectral shape of the excess is consistent with mSUGRA
and the WMAP relic density for rather heavy squarks and sleptons - O(1 TeV) -
and light charginos, neutralinos and gluinos (below 500 GeV).

neutrons and degenerate mirror neutrons in the context of mirror models for

oscillations occurred at a rate of $\tau^{-1}_{NN'}\sim sec^{-1}$, it would
help explain putative super GKZ cosmic ray events provided the temperature of
the mirror radiation is $\sim 0.3-0.4$ times that of familiar cosmic microwave
background radiation. We discuss how such oscillation time scales can be
realized in mirror models and find that the simplest nonsupersymmetric model
for this idea requires the existence of a low mass (30-3000 GeV) color triplet
scalar or vector boson. A supersymmetric model, where this constraint can be
avoided is severely constrained by the requirement of maintaining a cooler
mirror sector. We also find that the reheat temperature after inflation in
generic models that give fast $n-n'$ oscillation be less than about 300 GeV in
order to maintain the required relative coolness of the mirror sector.

expected from hard constituent scattering. We discuss the long-distance
pole--resonance contribution in understanding the origin of these phenomena, as
well as the amplitude relations governing the short-distance contribution which
we model as a scaling contribution. When considering the latter, we argue that
the difference found for the $K_SK_S$ and the $K^+K^-$ integrated cross

corresponds to the $\rho\omega\to a$ subprocess in the VMD

enhanced by the suppression of the $\phi$ component, and is hence constrained.
We give similar constraints to a number of other hadron pair production
channels. After writing down the scaling and pole--resonance contributions
accordingly, the direct summation of the two contributions is found to
reproduce some salient features of the $p\bar p$ and $K^+K^-$ data.

study the spectra of Laplacian matrices and relations between Laplacian
matrices and stochastic matrices. We prove that the standardized Laplacian

searches for axions from the sun. The axion is a pseudoscalar particle that was

dark matter candidates. The CAST experiment has been taking data during the
last two years, setting an upper limit on the coupling of axions to photons
more restrictive than from any other solar axion search in the mass range below
0.1 eV. In 2005 CAST will enter a new experimental phase extending the
sensitivity of the experiment to higher axion masses. The CAST experiment
strongly profits from technology developed for high energy physics and for
X-ray astronomy: A superconducting prototype LHC magnet is used to convert
potential axions to detectable X-rays in the 1-10 keV range via the inverse
Primakoff effect. The most sensitive detector system of CAST is a spin-off from
space technology, a Wolter I type X-ray optics in combination with a prototype
pn-CCD developed for ESA's XMM-Newton mission. As in other rare event searches,
background suppression and a thorough shielding concept is essential to improve
the sensitivity of the experiment to the best possible. In this context CAST
offers the opportunity to study the background of pn-CCDs and its long term
behavior in a terrestrial environment with possible implications for future
space applications. We will present a systematic study of the detector
background of the pn-CCD of CAST based on the data acquired since 2002

stock markets, with a broad (truncated) Levy distribution of weekly sales
differences in the baseline sales [R.D. Groot, Physica A 353 (2005) 501]. To
investigate the cause of this, the influence of social interactions and
advertisements are studied in an agent-based model of consumers in a social
network. The influence of network topology was varied by using a small-world
network, a random network and a Barabasi-Albert network. The degree to which
consumers value the opinion of their peers was also varied. On a small-world
and random network we find a phase-transition between an open market and a
locked-in market that is similar to condensation in liquids. At the critical
point, fluctuations become large and buying behaviour is strongly correlated.
However, on the small world network the noise distribution at the critical
point is Gaussian, and critical slowing down occurs which is not observed in
supermarket sales. On a scale-free network, the model shows a transition
between a gas-like phase and a glassy state, but at the transition point the
noise amplitude is much larger than what is seen in supermarket sales. To
explore the role of advertisements, a model is studied where imprints are
placed on the minds of consumers that ripen when a decision for a product is
made. The correct distribution of weekly sales returns follows naturally from
this model, as well as the noise amplitude, the correlation time and
cross-correlation of sales fluctuations. For particular parameter values,
simulated sales correlation shows power law decay in time. The model predicts
that social interaction helps to prevent aversion, and that products are viewed
more positively when their consumption rate is higher.

Einstein's (1905) equation for the energy, all ""particles"" (neutrons,

inverse of this frequency is the smallest operational unit of time available in
principle. With a corresponding ""coarse graining"" of an otherwise practically
idealized, continuous time (i.e., with the latter then holding on time scales
much larger than the coarse grained one), one can show that the basic features
of quantum theory can be derived from a minimal set of assumptions. In
particular, it is shown here how the Schroedinger equation can be derived from
classical physics modified only by said assumption of a coarse grained time and
the presence of so-called ""zero-point fluctuations"". The latter relate to the
dynamics of a ""fluid"" vacuum, which is today known to be a far cry from just
being ""empty space"". Consequently, it is shown that time and matter, when
discussed from a physical point of view, must by necessity be considered in one
common framework.

faster than multi-particle operators, such as c-NOT gates and Toffoli gates, in
