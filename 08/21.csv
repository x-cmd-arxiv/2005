around spiral galaxies, are ideal objects to probe the 3D shapes of dark matter
halos. The conditions to constrain the halos are that the perpendicular system
does not strongly perturb the host galaxy, or that it is possible to derive
back its initial shape, knowing the formation scenario of the polar ring. The
formation mechanisms are reviewed: mergers, tidal accretion, or gas accretion
from cosmic filaments. The Tully-Fisher diagram for polar rings reveals that
the velocity in the polar plane is higher than in the host plane, which can
only be explained if the dark matter is oblate and flattened along the polar
plane. Only a few individual systems have been studied in details, and 3D
shapes of their haloes determined by several methods. The high frequency of
warps could be explained by spontaneous bending instability, if the disks are
sufficiently self-gravitating, which can put constraints on the dark matter
flattening.

Survey (SDSS) survey. In this paper we perform a morphological classification

morphological dependence of the star formation rates (SFRs) for these member
galaxies. As we expect, a tight correlation between the normalized SFR by
stellar mass (SFR/M$_*$) and the H$\alpha$ equivalent width is found for the
late-type galaxies in A2255. The correlation of SFR/M$_*$ with the continuum
break strength at 4000 \AA is also confirmed. The SFR/M$_*$ - M$_*$ correlation
is found for both the early- and late-type galaxies, indicating that the star
formation activity tends to be suppressed when the assembled stellar mass
M$_*$) increases, and this correlation is tighter and steeper for the late-type
cluster galaxies. Compared with the mass range of field spiral galaxies, only
two massive late-type galaxies with M$_*>10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ are survived in
A2255, suggesting that the gas disks of massive spiral galaxies could have been
tidally stripped during cluster formation. Additionally, the SFR variation with
the projected radial distance are found to be heavily dependent upon galaxy
morphology: the early-type galaxies have a very weak inner decrease in
SFR/M$_*$, while the inner late-type galaxies tend to have higher SFR/M$_*$
values than the outer late-types. This may suggest that the galaxy-scale
turbulence stimulated by the merging of subclusters might have played different
roles on early- and late-type galaxies, which leads to a suppression of the
star formation activity for E/S0 galaxies and a SFR enhancement for spiral and
irregular galaxies.

  welcome",,"10.1088/0256-307X/23/5/080",,"astro-ph",,"  Numerical simulation is an important tool to help us understand the process
of structure formation in the universe. However many simulation results of cold
dark matter (CDM) halos on small scale are inconsistent with observations: the
central density profile is too cuspy and there are too many substructures. Here
we point out that these two problems may be connected with a hitherto
unrecognized bias in the simulation halos. Although CDM halos in nature and in
simulation are both virialized systems of collisionless CDM particles,
gravitational encounter cannot be neglected in the simulation halos because
they contain much less particles. We demonstrate this by two numerical
experiments, showing that there is a difference on the microcosmic scale
between the natural and simulation halos. The simulation halo is more akin to
globular clusters where gravitational encounter is known to lead to such
drastic phenomena as core collapse. And such artificial core collapse process
appears to link the two problems together in the bottom-up scenario of
structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM universe. The discovery of this bias
also has implications on the applicability of the Jeans Theorem in Galactic
Dynamics.

galaxies. Our goal is to investigate whether merger or interaction events could
be at the origin of the radio-AGN activity. Around five of our radio galaxies,
hosted mainly by early-type galaxies, we detect extended HI in emission. In
most cases this HI is distributed in large (up to 190 kpc) and massive (up to
M(HI) ~ 10^10 M(sun)) disk- or ring-like structures, that show fairly regular
rotation around the host galaxy. This suggests that in these systems a major
merger did occur, but at least several Gyr ago. For the HI-rich radio galaxy B2
0648+27 we confirm such a merger origin through the detection of a
post-starburst stellar population that dominates the visible light throughout
this system. The timescale of the current episode of radio-AGN activity in our
HI-rich radio galaxies is many orders of magnitude smaller than the merger
timescales. Therefore the radio-AGN activity either started late in the
lifetime of the merger event, or is not directly related to the merger event at
all. Another intriguing result is that the HI-rich (> 10^9 M(sun)) radio
galaxies in our sample all have compact radio sources, while none of the
extended radio sources contain these amounts of extended HI. This strongly
suggests that there is a relation between the size of the radio jet and the
presence of large amounts of neutral gas associated with the host galaxy.

to deep VLA imaging of the inner 140 arcsec of the giant low-luminosity radio
galaxy NGC 315. An optimized model accurately fits the data in both total
intensity and linear polarization. We infer that the velocity, emissivity and
field structure in NGC 315 are very similar to those of the other
low-luminosity sources we have modelled, but that all of the physical scales
are larger by a factor of about 5. We derive an inclination to the line of
sight of 38 degrees for the jets. Where they first brighten, their on-axis
velocity is approximately v/c = 0.9. They decelerate to v/c = 0.4 between 8 and
18 kpc from the nucleus and the velocity thereafter remains constant. The speed
at the edge of the jet is roughly 0.6 of the on-axis value where it is best
constrained, but the transverse velocity profile may deviate systematically
from the Gaussian form we assume. The proper emissivity profile is split into
three power-law regions separated by shorter transition zones. In the first of
these, at 3 kpc (the flaring point) the jets expand rapidly at constant
emissivity, leading to a large increase in the observed brightness on the
approaching side. At 10 kpc, the emissivity drops abruptly by a factor of 2.
Where the jets are well resolved their rest-frame emission is
centre-brightened. The magnetic field is modelled as random on small scales but
anisotropic and we rule out a globally ordered helical configuration. To a
first approximation, the field evolves from a mixture of longitudinal and
toroidal components to predominantly toroidal, but it also shows variations in
structure along and across the jets, with a significant radial component in
places. Simple adiabatic models fail to fit the emissivity variations.

existing finiteness result, we provide a concise proof of finiteness of the

This is accomplished by a suitable re-factoring and re-ordering of integration,
through which a large set of variables can be eliminated. The resulting
formulation can be interpreted as a ``dual variables'' model that uses
hyperboloid variables associated to spin foam edges in place of representation
variables associated to faces. We outline how this method may also be useful
for numerical computations, which have so far proven to be very challenging for
Lorentzian spin foam models.

new method of computing double cosets. Previous methods for double cosets were
enumerative and thus restricted to finite examples. Our rewriting methods do
not suffer this restriction and we present some examples of infinite double
coset systems which can now easily be solved using our approach. Even when both
enumerative and rewriting techniques are present, our rewriting methods will be
competitive because they i) do not require the preliminary calculation of
cosets; and ii) as with single coset problems, there are many examples for
which rewriting is more effective than enumeration.
  Automata provide the means for identifying expressions for normal forms in
infinite situations and we show how they may be constructed in this setting.
Further, related results on logged string rewriting for monoid presentations
are exploited to show how witnesses for the computations can be provided and
how information about the subgroups and the relations between them can be
extracted. Finally, we discuss how the double coset problem is a special case
of the problem of computing induced actions of categories which demonstrates
that our rewriting methods are applicable to a much wider class of problems
than just the double coset problem.

normal affine monoid algebra. This technique reduces all questions about the
Ehrhart h-vector of P to the Ehrhart h-vector of a Gorenstein polytope Q with
exactly one interior lattice point, provided each lattice point in a multiple
cP, c in N, can be written as the sum of n lattice points in P. (Up to a
translation, the polytope Q belongs to the class of reflexive polytopes
considered in connection with mirror symmetry.) If P has a regular unimodular
