two models used, take into account the angular momentum acquisition by the
proto-structures during their expansion and collapse. The first one is a
modification of the self-similar model (SSM) while the second one is a
modification of the Punctuated Equilibria Model (Cavaliere et al. 1999). In
both models the mass-temperature relation (M-T) used is based on the
calculations of Del Popolo (2002b). We show that the above models lead, in
X-rays, to a luminosity-temperature relation that scales as L \propto T^5, at
scale of groups, flattening to L \propto T^3 for rich clusters and converging
to L \propto T^2 at higher temperatures. However a fundamental result of our
paper is that the non-similarity in the L-T relation, can be explained by a
simple model that takes into account the amount of the angular momentum of a
proto-structure. This result is in disagreement with the widely accepted idea
that the above non-similarity is due to non-gravitating processes as those of
heating/cooling.

has been suggested that these highest-luminosity ULXs may contain accreting
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) binaries. We consider this hypothesis for
dense, young (about 100 Myr) stellar clusters where we assume that a 50-500
solar mass central IMBH has formed through runaway growth of a massive star.
Using numerical simulations of the dynamics and evolution of the central black
hole's captured companions, we obtain estimates of the incidence of mass
transfer phases and possible ULX activity throughout the IMBH's evolutionary
history. We find that, although it is common for the central black hole to
acquire binary companions, there is a very low probability that these
interacting binaries will become observable ULX sources.

properties. At least half of the LLAGNs show inverted spectra between 15 and 96
GHz; we use published data at 15 GHz with the Very Large Array (VLA) in a
0.15-arcsec resolution and our measurements at 96 GHz with the NMA in a
7-arcsec resolution. The inverted spectra are not artificially made due to
their unmatched beam sizes, because of little diffuse contamination from dust,
H II regions, or extended jets in these LLAGNs. Such high-frequency inverted
spectra are apparently consistent with a `submillimetre bump', which is
predicted by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model. We find a
strong correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and low-frequency
core power measured with very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments.
The inverted spectra were found exclusively in low-core-power sources, while
steep spectra were in high-core-power ones with prominent pc-scale jets. This
suggests that the ADAF and nonthermal jets may coexists. The flux ratios
between disc and jet seem to be different from LLAGN to LLAGN; disc components
can be seen in nuclear radio spectra only if the jets are faint.

the curvature effect could produce the relationship with the same slope as
those derived from Qin et al. (2004) model in the rise width vs. the full width

describe disc evolution we use a method which, using a series of simplifying

after $10^7 {\rm yr}$ is used to study the migration rate of a giant planet
through the model of this paper. The disk and migration models are used to
calculate the distribution of planets as function of mass and semimajor axis.
The results show that the model can give a reasonable prediction of planets'
semi-major axes and mass distribution. In particular there is a pile-up of
planets at $a \simeq 0.05$ AU, a minimum near 0.3 AU, indicating a paucity of
planets at that distance, and a rise for semi-major axes larger than 0.3 AU,
out to 3 AU. The semi-major axis distribution shows that the more massive
planets (typically, masses larger than $4 M_{\rm J}$) form preferentially in
the outer regions and do not migrate much. Intermediate-mass objects migrate
more easily whatever the distance they form, and that the lighter planets
(masses from sub-Saturnian to Jovian) migrate easily.

be clustered or classified are not points in a high-dimensional space, but are
distributions (points on a high dimensional simplex). For distributions,
natural measures of distance are not the $\ell_p$ norms and variants, but
information-theoretic measures like the Kullback-Leibler distance, the
Hellinger distance, and others. Efficient estimation of these distances is a
key component in algorithms for manipulating distributions. Thus, sublinear
resource constraints, either in time (property testing) or space (streaming)

  We start by resolving two open questions regarding property testing of
distributions. Firstly, we show a tight bound for estimating bounded, symmetric
f-divergences between distributions in a general property testing (sublinear
time) framework (the so-called combined oracle model). This yields optimal
algorithms for estimating such well known distances as the Jensen-Shannon
divergence and the Hellinger distance. Secondly, we close a $(\log n)/H$ gap
between upper and lower bounds for estimating entropy $H$ in this model. In a
stream setting (sublinear space), we give the first algorithm for estimating
the entropy of a distribution. Our algorithm runs in polylogarithmic space and
yields an asymptotic constant factor approximation scheme. We also provide
other results along the space/time/approximation tradeoff curve.

considering a matching of an interior solution governed by the dark energy

generalization arises from the fact that recent observations have confirmed an
accelerated cosmic expansion, for which dark energy is a possible candidate.
Several relativistic dark energy stellar configurations are analyzed by
imposing specific choices for the mass function. The first case considered is
that of a constant energy density, and the second choice, that of a monotonic
decreasing energy density in the star's interior. The dynamical stability of
the transition layer of these dark energy stars to linearized spherically
symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions is also
explored. It is found that large stability regions exist that are sufficiently
close to where the event horizon is expected to form, so that it would be
difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars,

Modern Mathematical Physics (JINR Dubna, July 2005) and at the 8th
International School-Seminar ``The actual problems of microworld physics 2005''
(Gomel-Dubna, August 2005). I review classical monopole solutions of the SU(N)
Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. The first part is a pedagogical introduction into to
the theory of non-Abelian SU(2) monopoles. In the second part I discuss a
particular case of SU(3) theories containing different limits of symmetry
breaking. It turns out that the multimonopole configurations are natural in a
model with the gauge group of higher rank. Here I discuss fundamental and
composite monopoles and consider the limiting situation of the massless states.
In the last part I briefly discuss construction of the $N = 2$ SU(2)
supersymmetric monopoles and some of the basic properties which are connected
with the field theoretical aspects of these classical solutions.

be mapped to a set of d operators acting on the space of functions on the
principal Spin(d)-bundle over M. In other words, any d-dimensional manifold can
be described in terms of d operators acting on an infinite dimensional space.
Therefore it is natural to introduce a new interpretation of matrix models in
which matrices represent such operators. In this interpretation the
diffeomorphism, local Lorentz symmetry and their higher-spin analogues are
included in the unitary symmetry of the matrix model. Furthermore the Einstein
equation is obtained from the equation of motion, if we take the standard form
of the action S=-tr([A_{a},A_{b}][A^{a},A^{b}]).

exist bound entanglement. The simplest example is the simultaneous amplitude

stronger than the CHSH inequality for 3 \otimes 3 isotropic states in the sense
that they are violated by some isotropic states in the 3 \otimes 3 system that
do not violate the CHSH inequality. These Bell inequalities are obtained by
applying triangular elimination to the list of known facet inequalities of the
cut polytope on nine points. This gives a partial solution to an open problem
posed by Collins and Gisin. The results of numerical optimization suggest that
they are candidates for being stronger than the I_3322 Bell inequality for 3
\otimes 3 isotropic states. On the other hand, we found no Bell inequalities
stronger than the CHSH inequality for 2 \otimes 2 isotropic states. In
addition, we illustrate an inclusion relation among some Bell inequalities
derived by triangular elimination.
