system and Galactic foregrounds have been subtracted is in excess of that
expected from energy released by galaxies and stars that formed during the z <
5 redshift interval (Arendt & Dwek 2003, Matsumoto et al. 2005). The spectral
signature of this excess near-infrared background light (NIRBL) component is
almost identical to that of reflected sunlight from the interplanetary dust
cloud, and could therefore be the result of the incomplete subtraction of this
foreground emission component from the diffuse sky maps. Alternatively, this
emission component could be extragalactic. Its spectral signature is consistent
with that of redshifted continuum and recombination line emission from HII
regions formed by the first generation of very massive stars. In this paper we
analyze the implications of this spectral component for the formation rate of
these Population III stars, the redshift interval during which they formed, the
reionization of the universe and evolution of collapsed halo masses. We find
that to reproduce the intensity and spectral shape of the NIRBL requires a peak
star formation rate that is higher by about a factor of 4 to 10 compared to
those derived from hierarchical models. Furthermore, an extragalactic origin
for the NIRBL leads to physically unrealistic absorption-corrected spectra of
distant TeV blazars. All these results suggest that Pop III stars contribute
only a fraction of the NIRBL intensity with zodiacal light, star forming
galaxies, and/or non-nuclear sources giving rise to the remaining fraction.

yield 25 (22) new X-ray detections in the 0.5-2 keV (2-10 keV) energy band. Our
sample covers a range in the 2-10 keV observed flux from 3x10^{-11} to
6x10^{-15} erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The percentage of the objects which are
likely obscured by Compton-thick matter (column density, N_H>1.6x10^{24}
atoms/cm/cm) is ~50%, and reaches ~80% for log(F_{2-10})<12.3. Hence, K-alpha
fluorescent iron lines with large Equivalent Width (EW > 0.6 keV) are common in
our sample (6 new detections at a confidence level >2 sigma). They are
explained as due to reflection off the illuminated side of optically thick
material. We confirm a correlation between the presence of a ~100-pc scale
nuclear dust in the WFC2 images and Compton-thin obscuration. We interpret this
correlation as due to the large covering fraction of gas associated with the
dust lanes following an idea originally proposed by Malkan et al. 1998, and
Matt 2000). The X-ray spectra of highly obscured AGN invariably present a
prominent soft excess emission above the extrapolation of the hard X-ray
component. This soft component can account for a very large fraction of the
overall X-ray energy budget. As this component is generally unobscured - and
therefore likely produced in extended gas structures - it may lead to a severe
underestimation of the nuclear obscuration in z~1 absorbed AGN, if standard
X-ray colors are used to classify them. As a by-product of our study, we report
the discovery of a soft X-ray, luminous (~7x10^{40} erg/s) halo embedding the

component amplitudes and spectral indices) in low-resolution and high
signal-to-noise ratio maps using MCMC, obtaining both best-fit values for each
parameter, and the associated uncertainty. The goodness-of-fit is evaluated by
a chi^2 statistic. Then we fix all non-linear parameters at their
low-resolution best-fit values, and solve analytically for high-resolution
component amplitude maps. This likelihood approach has many advantages: The
fitted model may be chosen freely, and the method is therefore completely
general; all assumptions are transparent; no restrictions on spatial variations
of foreground properties are imposed; the results may be rigorously monitored
by goodness-of-fit tests; and, most importantly, we obtain reliable error
estimates on all estimated quantities. We apply the method to simulated Planck
and six-year WMAP data based on realistic models, and show that separation at
the muK level is indeed possible in these cases. We also outline how the
foreground uncertainties may be rigorously propagated through to the CMB power
spectrum and cosmological parameters using a Gibbs sampling technique.

transitions such as OI*, OI**, SiII*, CII*, and FeII*. Together these
transitions allow us to study the the properties of the interstellar medium

neutral hydrogen column density of log N(HI)=22.15\pm 0.05 in the host. (2) The
associated metal lines exhibit multiple components over a velocity range of ~80
km/s, with >90% of the neutral gas confined in 20 km/s. (3) Comparisons between
different ionic transitions show that the host has little/no dust depletion and
has 1/100 solar metallicity. (4) The absorbing gas has much higher density than
that of intervening damped Lya absorption (DLA) systems. In addition, we report
the identification of an intervening DLA system at z_DLA=3.56439 with log

reach a ~10sigma limiting magnitude of z'_AB=28.5 (equivalent to 1.5M_sun/yr at
z=6.1, or 0.1L*_UV for the z~3 U-drop population). The star formation rate at
z~6 was approximately x6 LESS than at z~3. This declining comoving star
formation rate poses an interesting challenge for models which suggest that
L_UV>0.1L* star forming galaxies at z~6 reionized the universe. The short-fall
in ionizing photons might be alleviated by galaxies fainter than our limit, or
a radically different IMF. Alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have
occurred at z>>6. We have recently discovered evidence of an early epoch of
star formation in some of the i'-drops at z~6. Spitzer images with IRAC at

minor contribution of nearby unidentified EGRET \gray sources. While CTA 102
was only detected at energies above 10 MeV during the early mission, 3C~454.3
is most significantly detected in the COMPTEL 3-10 MeV band in the sum of all

likely steady 3-10 MeV emission over years, being independent of the observed
time variability at energies above 100 MeV as observed by EGRET. This
energy-dependent variability behaviour suggests different emission mechanisms
at work at the two bands. Putting the COMPTEL fluxes in multifrequency
perspective (radio to \grays), reveals for both sources the typical two-hump
blazar spectra, with a low-energy maximum around the IR and a high-energy
maximum at MeV energies. The latter one dominates the energy output across the

any of four XMM-Newton observations of the core of M31 were surveyed for time
variability over time-scales of seconds to thousands of seconds, and for
intensity variations between observations. This population is likely to be
dominated by low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs).
  Analysis of the shapes of power density spectra (PDS) of these sources allows
us to determine whether they are accreting at a high or low rate; in the
observed frequency range a broken power law (Type A) PDS indicates a low
accretion rate while a simple power law (Type B) indicates a high accretion
rate. We obtained the 0.3--10 keV luminosities of the sources by modelling
their spectral energy distributions. The luminosity function for Type A PDS
appears to consist of two populations, which we tentatively classify as neutron
star and black hole LMXBs.
  We find that 46 sources are likely X-ray binaries, 13 with possible black
hole primaries. Remarkably, 5 out of the 13 black hole candidates appear
persistently bright; there are no persistently bright black hole LMXBs known in
our Galaxy. The lightcurves of 55 X-ray sources had a probability of
variability >99% in at least one observation. Also, 57 of the sources show a
luminosity variation > ~5$\sigma$ between observations; 7 of these are classed
as transients, since they are absent in at least one observation, and vary in
luminosity by a factor of > ~10. Scaling this sample with the known Galactic
LMXBs, we find that the M31 sample has ~50% of the dippers, Z-sources and
transients.

dominated by a young, 500 Myr old stellar population. The UV/optical colors
resemble a mixture of the two populations, of which the young one accounts for
about 80%. Assuming that the residual emission is located at the BALQ redshift,
we find that the host galaxy has a resolved flux of about 10% of the BALQ flux.

is reviewed. The interplay between exchange (EX) and electromagnetic (EM)
interaction is discussed and argued that the singlet SC and uniform
ferromagnetic (F) order practically never coexist. In case of their mutual
coexistence the F order is modified into a domain-like or spiral structure
depending on magnetic anisotropy. It turns out that this situation is realized
in several superconductors such as $ErRh_{4}B_{4}$, $HoMo_{6}S_{8}$,
$HoMo_{6}Se_{8}$ with electronic and in $AuIn_{2}$ with nuclear magnetic order.
The later problem is also discussed here.
  The coexistence of SC and antiferromagnetism is more favorable than with the
modified F order. Very interesting physics is realized in systems with SC and
weak-ferromagnetism which results in an very reach phase diagram.
  The properties of magnetic superconductors in magnetic field are very
peculiar, especially near the (ferro)magnetic transition temperature where the
upper critical field becomes smaller than the thermodynamical critical field.
  The extremely interesting physics of Josephson junctions based on MS with
spiral magnetic order is also discussed. The existence of the triplet pairing
amplitude $F_{\uparrow \uparrow}$ ($F_{\downarrow \downarrow}$) in MS with
rotating magnetization (the effect recently rediscovered in SFS junctions)
gives rise to the so called $\pi $-contact. Furthermore, the interplay of the
superconducting and magnetic phase in such a contact renders possibilities for
a new type of coupled Josephson-qubits.

requires an energy gap in the bulk and gapless edge modes that conduct spin-up
and spin-down excitations in opposite directions. When the number of Kramers
pairs of edge modes is odd, certain one-particle scattering processes are
forbidden due to a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index. We show that in a
many-body description, there are other scattering processes that can localize
the edge modes and destroy the QSHE: the region of stability for both classes
of models (even or odd number of Kramers pairs) is obtained explicitly in the
chiral boson theory. For a single Kramers pair the QSHE is stable to weak
interactions and disorder, while for two Kramers pairs it is not; however, the
two-pair case can be stabilized by {\it either} finite attractive or repulsive
interactions. For the simplest case of a single pair of edge modes, it is shown
that changing the screening length in an edge with screened Coulomb
interactions can be used to drive a phase transition between the QSHE state and

stems from the presence of many local minima, typically separated by high
barriers and often disconnected in configurational space. We obtain the global
minimum on model potential energy surfaces without sampling any minima a
priori. Instead, a different problem is derived, which is convex and hence easy
to solve, but which is guaranteed to either have the same solution or to be a
lower bound to the true solution. A systematic way for improving the latter
solutions is also given. Because many nonconvex problems are projections of
higher dimensional convex problems, Parrilo has recently showed that by
obtaining a sum of squares decomposition of the original problem, which can be
subsequently transformed to a semidefinite programme a large class of
non-convex problems can be solved efficiently. The semidefinite duality
formulation also provides a proof that the global minimum of the energy surface
has either been found exactly or has been bounded from below. It additionally
provides physical insight into the problem through a geometric interpretation.
The sum of squares polynomial representation of the potential energy surface
may further reveal information about the nature of the potential energy
surface. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to low dimensional

Moreover, the point contact resistance is found to vary with temperature in a

appear various types of phases as the bending rigidity K changes in the range
-infty < K < infty. In this paper, we investigate the K<0 regime, for which the
CVM analysis with the single-hexagon-cluster approximation predicts two types
of (crumpling) transitions of both continuous and discontinuous characters. We
diagonalized the transfer matrix for the strip widths up to L=26 with the aid

Q=0.03(2) and 0.04(2) for respective transitions. These results indicate that
the singularity of crumpling transition can turn into a weak-first-order type

noise-corrupted observations. Perfect reconstruction is seldom possible and
performance is measured under a given fidelity criterion. In a recent work, the
authors addressed the problem of denoising unknown discrete signals corrupted
by a discrete memoryless channel when the channel, rather than being completely
known, is only known to lie in some uncertainty set of possible channels. A
sequence of denoisers was derived for this case and shown to be asymptotically
optimal with respect to a worst-case criterion argued most relevant to this
setting. In the present work we address the implementation and complexity of
this denoiser for channels parametrized by a scalar, establishing its
practicality. We show that for symmetric channels, the problem can be mapped
into a convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently. We also
present empirical results suggesting the potential of these schemes to do well
in practice. A key component of our schemes is an estimator of the subset of
channels in the uncertainty set that are feasible in the sense of being able to
give rise to the noise-corrupted signal statistics for some channel input
distribution. We establish the efficiency of this estimator, both
algorithmically and experimentally. We also present a modification of the
recently developed discrete universal denoiser (DUDE) that assumes a channel
based on the said estimator, and show that, in practice, the resulting scheme
performs well. For concreteness, we focus on the binary alphabet case and
binary symmetric channels, but also discuss the extensions of the algorithms to
general finite alphabets and to general channels parameterized by a scalar.

Moreover, if the decoding time complexity of the assumed family of codes is

estimate the capture rate. The semirelativistic approximation improves upon
treatments which use orbits at Newtonian-order and quadrupolar radiation
emission, and matches well onto accurate Teukolsky simulations for low
eccentricity orbits. Formulae are presented for the semirelativistic energy and
angular momentum fluxes as a function of general orbital parameters.

the planned gravitational-wave detector LISA requires preparation of waveform

that this bound system either completely follows the cosmological expansion, or

neutrino experiment will favor neither of the contesting sides, stating in fact
that the LSND effect with the original oscillation amplitude is not confirmed,
but a new LSND effect with a considerably smaller amplitude is found (or, at
least, strongly suggested). Then, in the framework of neutrino oscillations,
the presence in Nature of hypothetical light sterile neutrinos (mixing with
three active neutrinos with a weak strength) will be unambiguously suggested by
post-MiniBooNE neutrino data (unless the credible CPT invariance is seriously
violated). In the new situation, the 3+1 neutrino models may work all right.
The same is true also for simple 3+2 neutrino models. For illustration of this

incorporate angular momentum into the action, although this imposes restriction
upon the dimensionality of the background solutions. We also consider the case
of non-Abelian non-BPS branes, and examine the resultant dynamics using
world-volume symmetry transformations. We find that the fuzzy sphere always

the higher spin Goldstino mode responsible for the symmetry breaking has a

result is precisely in agreement with the AdS/CFT correspondence, which implies
that N=4 SYM at vanishing coupling constant is dual to a theory in AdS which
exhibits higher spin gauge symmetry enhancement. When the SYM coupling is
non-zero, the current conservation condition becomes anomalous, and
correspondingly the local higher spin symmetry in the bulk gets spontaneously
broken. We also show that the mass of the Goldstino mode is exactly the one
predicted by the correspondence. Finally, we obtain the form of a class of

photons considered as finite entities and propagating along some distinguished
direction in space in a consistent translational-rotational manner. The
starting assumption reflects their most trustful property to propagate
translationally in a uniform way along straight lines. The model gives correct
energy-momentum characteristics and connects the rotational characteristics of
photons with corresponding nonintegrability (or curvature) of some
2-dimensional distributions (or Pfaff systems) on $\mathbb{R}^4$. It is
obtained that the curvature is proportional to the corresponding
energy-density. The field equations are obtained through a Lagrangian and they
express a consistency condition between photon's translational and rotational
propagation properties. The energy tensor is deduced directly from the
equations since the corresponding Hilbert energy-tensor becomes zero on the
solutions. Planck's formula $E=h\nu$ is naturally obtained as an integral
translational-rotational consistency relation.

commutative Noetherian ring $R$ of prime characteristic $p$. The formal
definition requires, on the face of things, an infinite number of checks to
determine whether or not an element of $R$ belongs to the tight closure of $I$.
The situation in this respect is much improved by Hochster's and Huneke's test
elements for tight closure, which exist when $R$ is a reduced algebra of finite
type over an excellent local ring of characteristic $p$.
  More recently, Hochster and Huneke have introduced the concept of test
exponent for tight closure: existence of these test exponents would mean that
one would have to perform just one single check to determine whether or not an
element of $R$ belongs to the tight closure of $I$. However, to quote Hochster
and Huneke, 'it is not at all clear whether to expect test exponents to exist;
roughly speaking, test exponents exist if and only if tight closure commutes
with localization'.
  The main purpose of this paper is to provide a short direct proof that test
exponents exist for parameter ideals in a reduced excellent equidimensional

establish uniform consistency of certain estimators of marginal distribution

neutron-proton effective mass splitting the difference between nn and pp
scattering cross sections increases with the increasing isospin asymmetry of
the medium. Within the transport model IBUU04, the in-medium NN cross sections
are found to influence significantly the isospin transport in heavy-ion
reactions. With the in-medium NN cross sections, a symmetry energy of
$E_{sym}(\rho)\approx 31.6(\rho /\rho_{0})^{0.69}$ was found most acceptable
compared with both the MSU isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable
neutron-skin thickness in $^{208}$Pb. The isospin dependent part $K_{asy}(\rho

$-500\pm 50$ MeV. The possibility of determining simultaneously the in-medium

transverse flow, or even better the combined transverse flow of neutrons and

chemical accuracy for the first time by means of W1 and W2 theory. These
molecules exhibit particularly severe degrees of inner polarization, and as
such obtaining a basis-set limit SCF component to the total atomization energy
becomes a challenge. (Adding high-exponent $d$ functions to a standard $spd$
basis set has an effect on the order of 100 kcal/mol for Cl$_2$O$_7$.) Wilson's
aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets represent a dramatic improvement over the standard
aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets, while the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f sequence converges still
more rapidly. Jensen's polarization consistent basis sets still require
additional high-exponent $d$ functions: for smooth convergence we suggest the
\{aug-pc1+3d,aug-pc2+2d,aug-pc3+d,aug-pc4\} sequence. The role of the tight $d$
functions is shown to be an improved description of the Cl (3d) Rydberg
orbital, enhancing its ability to receive back-bonding from the oxygen lone
pairs. In problematic cases like this (or indeed in general), a single
SCF/aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f calculation may be preferable over empirically motivated
extrapolations. Our best estimate heats of formation are $\Delta
H^\circ_{f,298}[$HClO$_4$(g)$]=-0.6\pm$1 kcal/mol and $\Delta
H^\circ_{f,298}[$Cl$_2$O$_7$(g)$]=65.9\pm$2 kcal/mol, the largest source of
uncertainty being our inability to account for post-CCSD(T) correlation
effects. While G2 and G3 theory have fairly large errors, G3X theory reproduces
both values to within 2 kcal/mol.

ratio across the interface induced by fingering and dispersion processes. We
show that fingering contributes transiently to the broadening of the peak in
time by increasing its variance. A quantitative analysis of the asymptotic
contribution of fingering to this variance is conducted as a function of the
four relevant parameters of the problem i.e. the log-mobility ratio R, the
length of the slice l, the Peclet number Pe and the ratio between transverse
