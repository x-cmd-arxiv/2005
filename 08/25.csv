how the accretion flow changes as a function of increasing mass accretion rate,
or L/L_Edd. These data can be synthetised with theoretical models of the
accretion flow to give a coherent picture of accretion in strong gravity, in
which the major hard-soft spectral transition is triggered by a change in the
nature and geometry of the inner accretion flow from a hot, optically thin
plasma to a cool, optically thick accretion disc. However, a straightforward
application of these models to AGN gives clear discrepancies in overall
spectral shape. Either the underlying accretion model is wrong, despite its
success in describing the Galactic systems and/or there is additional physics
which breaks the simple scaling from stellar to supermassive black holes.

well as a reanalysis of archival HST spectra, from the extreme Narrow-line
Seyfert 1 Galaxy RE 1034+39 (KUG 1031+398). RE 1034+39 has an unusually hard
spectral energy distribution (SED) that peaks in the soft X-rays. Its emission
lines are unusual in that they can all be modelled as a Lorentzian centered at
the rest wavelength with only a small range in velocity widths. In order to
investigate whether the unusual SED influences the emission line ratios and
equivalent widths, we present three complementary types of photoionization
analysis. The FUSE spectrum was particularly important because it includes the
high-ionization line OVI. First, we use the photoionization code Cloudy and the
SED developed from the coordinated observations to confirm that the emission
lines are consistent with observed hard SED. The best model parameters were an
ionization parameter log(U) ~ -2 and a hydrogen number density log(n_H)=9.75
[cm^-2]. Second, we present a Locally Optimally-emitting Cloud model. This
model produced enhanced OVI as observed, but also yielded far too strong MgII.
Third, we develop a series of semi-empirical SEDs, run Cloudy models, and
compare the results with the measured values using a figure of merit (FOM). The
FOM minimum indicates similar SED and gas properties as were inferred from the
one-zone model using the RE 1034+39 continuum. Furthermore, the FOM increases
sharply toward softer continua, indicating that a hard SED is required by the
data in the context of a one-zone model.

of only massive and very massive stars (VMS) on the chemical evolution of the
Galaxy. We adopted the two-infall chemical evolution model of Chiappini et al.
and tested several sets of yields for primordial VMS (Pair-Creation SNe), which
produce different amounts of heavy elements than lower mass stars. We focused
on the evolution of alpha-elements, C, N, Fe. The effects of PopIII stars on
the Galactic evolution of these elements is negligible if a few generations of
such stars occurred, whereas they produce different results from the standard
models if they formed for a longer period. Also the effects of a more strongly
variable IMF were discussed, making use of suggestions appeared in the
literature to explain the lack of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo with
respect to model predictions. The predicted variations in abundances, SN rates,
G-dwarf [Fe/H] distribution are here more dramatic and in contrast with
observations; we concluded that a constant or slightly varying IMF is the best
solution. Our main conclusion is that if VMS existed they must have formed only
for a very short period of time (until the halo gas reached the threshold
metallicity for the formation of very massive objects); in this case, their
effects on the evolution of the studied elements was negligible also in the
earliest phases. We thus cannot prove or disprove the existence of such stars
on the basis of the available data. Due to their large metal production and
short lives, primordial VMS should have enriched the halo gas beyond the
metallicity of the most metal poor stars known in a few Myrs. This constrains
the number of Pair-Creation SNe: we find that a number of 2-20 of such SNe
occurred in our Galaxy depending on the stellar yields.

been ignored in previous studies, as well as the conventional halo population.
Halos and subhalos are linked to central and satellite galaxies by adopting an
universal scaling relation between masses of (sub-)halos and luminosities of
galaxies. Our model predicts that 10%-20% of lenses should be caused by the
subhalo population. The fraction of lensing by satellite galaxies (subhalos)
peaks at ~1'' and decreases rapidly with increasing image separations. We
compute fractions of lenses which lie in groups and clusters, and find them to
be ~14% and ~4%, respectively: Nearly half of such lenses are expected to be
produced by satellite galaxies, rather than central parts of halos. We also
study mass distributions of lensing halos and find that even at image
separations of ~3'' the deviation of lens mass distributions from isothermal
profiles is large: At or beyond ~3'' image separations are enhanced
significantly by surrounding halos. Our model prediction agrees reasonably well
with observed image separation distributions from galaxy to cluster scales.

Reichart & Nysewander (2005; astro-ph/0508111) pointed out after Guidorzi's

distribution around it to accommodate and measure this sample variance.
Ignoring sample variance in a fit that requires it very easily results in
incorrect fitted parameter values due to increased sensitivity to outliers, as
well as significantly underestimated uncertainties in these fitted parameter
values. Fitting to Guidorzi's own data, Reichart & Nysewander (2005) showed
that when sample variance is included in the model, L ~ V^3.4(+0.9,-0.6) with a

distinct coronal source, which we identify as the LT source, was seen in each
of these flares from the early ``pre-heating'' phase through the late decay
phase. Spectral analyses reveal an evident steep power-law component in the
pre-heating and impulsive phases, suggesting that the particle acceleration
starts upon the onset of the flares. In the late decay phase the LT source has
a thermal spectrum and appears to be confined within a small region near the
top of the flare loop, and does not spread throughout the loop, as is observed
at lower energies. The total energy of this source decreases usually faster
than expected from the radiative cooling but much slower than that due to the
classical Spitzer conductive cooling along the flare loop. These results
indicate the presence of a distinct LT region, where the thermal conductivity
is suppressed significantly and/or there is a continuous energy input. We
suggest that plasma wave turbulence could play important roles in both heating
the plasma and suppressing the conduction during the decay phase of solar
flares. With a simple quasi-steady loop model we show that the energy input in
the gradual phase can be comparable to that in the impulsive phase and
demonstrate how the observed cooling and confinement of the LT source can be
used to constrain the wave-particle interaction.

different redshifts and to identify their present-day descendants by letting
their haloes evolve forward in time. It is found that, in the view of the mass
evolution of hosting haloes in the CDM model, bright LBGs are consistent with
being the progenitor of the OPEGs, whereas it is less likely that the LBG
population, as a whole, have evolved into the OPEG population. It is also found
that the present-day descendants of both the bright LBGs and OPEGs are likely

flow (RIAF) is expected to occur, when its dimensionless accretion rate is
lower than the critical value. The RIAF is very hot, and it radiates mostly in
the hard X-ray band (>100 keV). Assuming that the accretion disk in every
bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) will finally undergo a RIAF phase while
the accretion rate is lower than the critical value, we calculate the
contribution of the RIAFs in AGNs to the cosmological X-ray background of
10-1000 keV. We find that the timescale of the RIAF accreting at slightly below
the critical rate should be shorter than 0.01 of the bright AGN lifetime if the
critical accretion rate is 0.01, i.e., the accretion rate declines from the
critical value to a rate significantly lower than this critical rate within
this RIAF timescale. The derived RIAF timescale is affected by the parameters
adopted in the model calculations, which is also discussed in this Letter.

indicating the violation of Gnevyshev-Ohl rule. The distribution of flares with
respect to heliographic latitudes shows a significant asymmetry between
northern and southern hemisphere which is maximum during the minimum phase of
the solar cycle. The present study indicates that the activity dominates the
northern hemisphere in general during the rising phase of the cycle
(1997-2000). The dominance of northern hemisphere is shifted towards the
southern hemisphere after the solar maximum in 2000 and remained there in the
successive years. Although the annual variations in the asymmetry time series
during cycle 23 are quite different from cycle 22, they are comparable to cycle

projection onto the sky into the analytic formalism proposed recently by Lee,
Jing, & Suto. The theoretical distribution of the cluster axis-ratios is shown
to depend on the amplitude of the linear power spectrum (sigma_8) as well as
the density parameter (Omega_{m}). Finally, fitting the observational data to
the analytic distribution with Omega_{m} and sigma_{8} as two adjustable free
parameters, we find the best-fitting value of sigma_{8}=(1.01 +/-
0.09)(Omega_{m}/0.6)^{(0.07 +/- 0.02) +0.1 Omega_{m}}$. It is a new
sigma_{8}-Omega_{m} relation, different from the previous one derived from the

properties of the stellar populations or of dust attenuation is established
with the use of combined stellar population and radiative transfer models. The
distribution of the z ~ 2 UV-luminous FDF galaxies in several diagnostic
diagrams shows that their extinction curves range between those typical of the
Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC, respectively). For the majority
of strongly reddened objects having a UV continuum slope beta > -0.4 a
significant 2175 A absorption feature is inferred, indicating an LMC-like
extinction curve. On the other hand, the UV continua of the least reddened

significant 2175 A bump, as for the Calzetti et al. sample of local starbursts.
Furthermore, the most opaque (beta ~ 0) UV-luminous galaxies tend to be among
the most metal rich, most massive, and largest systems at z ~ 2. The presence
of the UV bump does not seem to depend on the total metallicity, as given by
the equivalent width (EW) of the C IV doublet. Conversely, it seems to be
associated with large EWs of prominent interstellar low-ionisation absorption

that at least two components, centred at 2165.7 cm$^{-1}$ (FWHM = 26 cm$^{-1}$)
and 2175.4 cm$^{-1}$ (FWHM = 15 cm$^{-1}$), underlie the XCN band. Only the

hydrogen-bonding, and possibly thermally annealed, ice environment based on
laboratory OCN$^-$ spectra. In order to correct for the contribution of the

2165.7- and the 2175.4-components is used to fit the full band profile and
derive the OCN$^-$ abundance for each line-of-sight. The same analysis is
performed for 5 high-mass YSO's taken from the ISO-SWS data archive. Inferred
OCN$^-$ abundances are $\leq$ 0.85 % toward low-mass YSO's and $\leq$ 1 %
toward high-mass YSO's, except for W33 A. Abundances are found to vary by at
least a factor of 10--20 and large source-to-source abundance variations are
observed within the same star-forming cloud complex on scales down to 400 AU,
indicating that the OCN$^-$ formation mechanism is sensitive to local
conditions. The inferred abundances allow quantitatively for photochemical
formation of OCN$^-$, but the large abundance variations are not easily
explained in this scenario unless local radiation sources or special geometries
are invoked. Surface chemistry should therefore be considered as an alternative

ungapped everywhere in the Fermi surface, resolving the long-standing puzzle of
coexistence of gapless excitations and commensurate CDW in the 2H-TMDs.

transverse field is used to tune the tunnel splitting over a large range. Using
the LZ and inverse LZ method, it is shown that these interactions play an
important role in the tunnel rates. Three regions are identified: (i) at small
transverse fields, tunneling is dominated by single tunnel transitions; (ii) at
intermediate transverse fields, the measured tunnel rates are governed by
reshuffling of internal fields, (iii) at larger transverse fields, the
magnetization reversal starts to be influenced by the direct relaxation
process, and many-body tunnel events may occur. The hole digging method is used

spinor charge is used to establish a lower bound on the conserved energy of any
solution that satisfies boundary conditions for which $W$ has a global minimum.
A large class of designer gravity theories therefore have a stable ground
state, which the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates should be the lowest energy
soliton. We make progress towards proving this, by showing that minimum energy
solutions are static. The generalization of our results to designer gravity
theories in higher dimensions involving several tachyonic scalars is discussed.

gravity''. This includes: (a) A simultaneous classification that shows how
generic maximal globally hyperbolic spacetimes of constant curvature, which
admit a complete Cauchy surface (in particular a compact one), as well as
complex projective structures on arbitrary surfaces, are all encoded by pairs
(H,L), H being a ``straight convex sets'' in the hyperbolic plane, and L a
``measured geodesic laminations'' suitably defined on H. (b) Canonical
geometric correlations: spacetimes of different curvature, that share a same
encoding pair (H,L), are related to each other by ``canonical rescaling''; they
can be transformed by ``canonical Wick rotations'' in hyperbolic 3-manifolds,
that carry asymptotically the corresponding projective structures. Both Wick
rotations and rescalings act along the ""canonical cosmological time"" and have
``universal rescaling functions''. These correlations are functorial with
respect to isomorphisms of the respective geometric categories. We analyze the
behaviour along a ray of measured laminations, (broken) T-symmetry by
spacetimes of negative curvature, the relationship with ``earthquake theory'',
beyond the case of compact Cauchy surface. WR-rescaling does apply on the
``ends'' of geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, that hence realize
concrete interactions of their globally hyperbolic ``ending spacetimes'' of
constant curvature. It also provides further ""classical amplitudes"" of these
interactions, beyond the volume of the hyperbolic convex cores.

  corrected",,,"Preprint MPIM2005-54","math.QA",,"  In our previous paper math.QA/0412192 the Cayley-Hamilton identity for the
GL(m|n) type quantum matrix algebra was obtained. Here we continue
investigation of that identity. We derive it in three alternative forms and,
most importantly, we obtain it in a factorized form. The factorization leads to
a separation of the spectra of the quantum supermatrix into the ""even"" and
""odd"" parts. The latter, in turn, allows us to parameterize the characteristic
subalgebra (which can also be called the subalgebra of spectral invariants) in
terms of the supersymmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues of the quantum
supermatrix. For our derivation we use two auxiliary results which may be of
independent interest. First, we calculate the multiplication rule for the
linear basis of the Schur functions $s_{\lambda}(M)$ for the characteristic
subalgebra of the Hecke type quantum matrix algebra. The structure constants in
this basis are the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Second, we derive a
series of bilinear relations in the graded ring $\Lambda$ of Schur symmetric
functions in countably many variables.

nearest neighbor, one-dimensional Cellular Automata (CA) as an example, we show
how to construct local coarse-grained descriptions of CA in all classes of
Wolfram's classification. The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are
capable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without
accounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by
this construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate
any CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show
that because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex
physical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of
description. The renormalization group flows that we construct induce a
hierarchy of CA rules. This hierarchy agrees well with apparent rule complexity
and is therefore a good candidate for a complexity measure and a classification
method. Finally we argue that the large scale dynamics of CA can be very
simple, at least when measured by the Kolmogorov complexity of the large scale
update rule, and moreover exhibits a novel scaling law. We show that because of
this large-scale simplicity, the probability of finding a coarse-grained
description of CA approaches unity as one goes to increasingly coarser scales.
We interpret this large scale simplicity as a pattern formation mechanism in
which large scale patterns are forced upon the system by the simplicity of the
rules that govern the large scale dynamics.

  Cosmology Conference, June 23-25, 2005, Moncao, Portugal",,,,"physics.space-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  The understanding of the universe is confused by the unknown nature of about
95% of its matter, required to confine the motions of space objects in cosmic
structures. The idea of this paper is that the self-similar transformations of
one postulated basic matter create the fundamental dynamic fractal elements of
the universe. The elements are described with equation of unifying interaction
drawn into their fundamental framework. The equation transforms into the
inverse square laws, the principle of uncertainty, Maxwell equations of
electromagnetic field and into MOND like expression after modification of its
parameters at the scales where these laws and principle are found to hold. The
introduced equation is also confirmed with calculations based on the orbital
data for bodies that move around the nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, the
centers of the Earth and the Sun and orbit the huge 87 Sylvia asteroid. The
puzzling constant sunward force that acts on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft,
the flat rotational curves of stars far from the galactic nuclei, the nature of
dark matter and the enigmatic cosmic repulsion are explained in terms of
contracting and expanding 3D-spirally-faster-inward-oscillating vortexes of
basic matter, called dynamic fractals. The latter create new fundamental
framework, which allows qualitative and quantitative modeling by fitting of the
parameters of the equation of unifying interaction to experimental data. The
calculations based on the proposed dynamic fractal framework are in agreement
with the considered orbital data. Many testable predictions are made and
natural hazard precursors are suggested.
