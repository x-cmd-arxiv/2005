classes based on their duration and spectral hardness -- the long-soft and the
short-hard bursts. The discovery of afterglow emission from long GRBs was a
watershed event, pinpointing their origin to star forming galaxies, and hence
the death of massive stars, and indicating an energy release of about 10^51
erg. While theoretical arguments suggest that short GRBs are produced in the
coalescence of binary compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), the
progenitors, energetics, and environments of these events remain elusive
despite recent localizations. Here we report the discovery of the first radio
afterglow from a short burst, GRB 050724, which unambiguously associates it
with an elliptical galaxy at a redshift, z=0.257. We show that the burst is
powered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long GRBs, with the
ejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is
10-1000 times smaller. More importantly, the nature of the host galaxy
demonstrates that short GRBs arise from an old (>1 Gyr) stellar population,
strengthening earlier suggestions, and providing support for coalescing compact
object binaries as the progenitors.

scheme. General relativistic effects are mimicked using the \Pacz-Wiita
pseudo-potential and gravitational radiation reaction forces. Opposite to
previous, purely Newtonian calculations, in none of the explored cases episodic
mass transfer occurs. The neutron star is always completely disrupted after
most of its mass has been transferred directly into the hole. For black hole
masses between 14 and 16 \Msun an accretion disk forms, large parts of it,
however, are inside the last stable orbit and therefore falling with large
radial velocities into the hole. These disks are (opposite to the neutron star
merger case) thin and -apart from a spiral shock- essentially cold. For higher
mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \ge 18$ \msun) almost the complete neutron star
disappears in the hole without forming an accretion disk. In these cases the
surviving material is spun up by tidal torques and ejected as a half-ring of
neutron-rich matter. None of the investigated systems is a promising GRB
central engine. We find between 0.01 and 0.2 \Msun of the neutron star to be
dynamically ejected. Like in a type Ia supernova, the radioactive decay of this

circumstellar shells. The nature of the dust-forming environment is influenced
by the evolution of the stars, in terms of both chemistry and density, leading
to an evolution in the nature of the dust that is produced. Carbon-rich AGB
stars are known to produce silicon carbide (SiC). Furthermore, observations of
the ~11um SiC feature show that the spectral features change in a sequence that
correlates with stellar evolution. We present new infrared spectra of amorphous
SiC and show that the ~9um feature seen in both emission and absorption, and
correlated with trends in the ~11um feature, may be due to either amorphous SiC
or to nano-crystalline diamond with a high proportion of Si substituting for C.
Furthermore, we identify SiC absorption in three ISO spectra of extreme carbon
stars, in addition to the four presented by Speck et al. (1997). An accurate
description of the sequence in the IR spectra of carbon stars requires
accounting for both SiC emission and absorption features. This level of detail
is needed to infer the role of dust in evolution of carbon stars. Previous
attempts to find a sequence in the infrared spectra of carbon stars considered
SiC emission features, while neglecting SiC absorption features, leading to an
interpretation of the sequence inadequately describes the role of dust. We show
that the evolutionary sequence in carbon star spectra is consistent with a
grain size evolution, such that dust grains get progressively smaller as the
star evolves. The evolution of the grain sizes provides a natural explanation
for the shift of the ~11um SiC feature in emission and in absorption. Further
evidence for this scenario is seen in both post-AGB star spectra and in
meteoritic studies of presolar grains.

perturbative analysis for our spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova

accreting onto the proto-neutron star shortly after collapse and bounce. This
significantly modifies the pressure profile and increases the heating of the
material above the proto-neutron star resulting in an explosion even in
rotating stars that would not explode otherwise. Regarding magnetic bubbles we
show that a model with a modest initial uniform magnetic field and uniform
angular velocity of ~0.1 rad/s can form magnetic bubbles due to the very non
homologous nature of the collapse. It is estimated that the buoyancy of the
bubbles causes matter in the proto-neutron star to rise, carrying neutrino-rich
material to the neutron-star surface. This increases the neutrino luminosity
sufficiently at early times to achieve a successful neutrino-driven explosion.
Both magnetic mechanisms thus provide new means for initiating a Type II

this source, focusing on three characteristics: fractional amplitude, harmonic
content and frequency. Fractional amplitude and harmonic content constrain the
size, shape and position of the emitting region, whilst variations in frequency
indicate motion of the emitting region on the neutron star surface. We examine
both long-term variability over the course of the outburst, and short-term
variability during the bursts. For most of the bursts, fractional amplitude is
consistent with that of the accretion pulsations, implying a low degree of fuel
spread. There is however a population of bursts whose fractional amplitudes are
substantially lower, implying a higher degree of fuel spread, possibly forced
by the explosive burning front of a precursor burst. For the first harmonic,
substantial differences between the burst and accretion pulsations suggest that
hotspot geometry is not the only mechanism giving rise to harmonic content in
the latter. Fractional amplitude variability during the bursts is low; we
cannot rule out the hypothesis that the fractional amplitude remains constant
for bursts that do not exhibit photospheric radius expansion (PRE). There are
no significant variations in frequency in any of the bursts except for the one
burst that exhibits PRE. This burst exhibits a highly significant but small
($\approx 0.1$Hz) drop in frequency in the burst rise. The timescale of the
frequency shift is slower than simple burning layer expansion models predict,
suggesting that other mechanisms may be at work.

Earlier (Minchin et al. 2005) we suggested that VIRGOHI 21, a 21-cm source we
found in the Virgo Cluster at Jodrell Bank using single-dish observations
(Davies et al. 2004), was probably such a dark galaxy because of its broad
line-width (~ 200 km/s) unaccompanied by any visible gravitational source to
account for it. Now we have managed to image VIRGOHI 21 in the neutral-hydrogen
line, and indeed we find what appears to be a dark, edge-on, spinning disc with
the mass and diameter of a typical spiral galaxy. Moreover the disc has
unquestionably interacted with NGC 4254, a luminous spiral with an odd
one-armed morphology, but lacking the massive interactor invariably responsible
for such a feature. Published numerical models (Vollmer, Huchtmeier & van Driel
2005) of NGC 4254 call for a close interaction ~ 10^8 years ago with a
perturber of 10^11 solar masses. This we take as completely independent
evidence for the massive nature of VIRGOHI 21.

imply gas column densities more than 5 times higher than observed in HI. We
suggest that the dust emission detected here comes from small molecular clumps,

on the activity of individual galaxies. This paper presents the most
comprehensive radio continuum investigation of the region, relying on a
63-pointing mosaic obtained with the Very Large Array yielding an areal
coverage of nearly 7 square degrees. The mosaic provides a typical sensitivity
of about 80 uJy at a resolution of 16"", enabling detection of galaxies with
star formation rates as low as 1 solar mass per year. The radio data are
complemented by optical imaging in B and R, producing a catalog of 210
radio-detected galaxies with m_R <= 17.36 (M_R <= -19). At least 104 of these
radio-detected galaxies are members of the supercluster on the basis of public
velocity measurements. Across the entire core of the supercluster, there
appears to be a significant deficit of radio galaxies at intermediate optical
magnitudes (M_R between -21 and -22). This deficit is offset somewhat by an
increase in the frequency with which brighter galaxies (M_R less than -22) host
radio sources. More dramatic is the highly significant increase in the
probability for fainter galaxies (M_R between -20 and -21) in the vicinity of
A3562 and SC1329-313 to be associated with radio emission. The radio and
optical data for these sources strongly suggest that these active galaxies are
powered by star formation. In conjunction with recent X-ray analysis, this is
interpreted as young starbursts related to the recent merger of SC1329-313 with
A3562 and the rest of the supercluster.

formed in cosmological N-body simulations. This hypothesis can be viewed as an
extension of an earlier idea put forth by Merritt and Aguilar. Our findings
suggest that a phenomenon related to the radial orbit instability is present in
such halos and is responsible for density profile shapes. This instability sets
a scalelength at which the velocity dispersion distribution changes rapidly
from isotropic to radially anisotropic. This scalelength is reflected in the
density distribution as the radius at which the density profile changes slope.
We have tested the idea that radially dependent velocity dispersion anisotropy
leads to a break in density profile shape by manipulating the input of a
semi-analytic model to imitate the velocity structure imposed by the radial
orbit instability. Without such manipulation, halos formed are approximated by
single power-law density profiles and isotropic velocity distributions. Halos
formed with altered inputs display density distributions featuring scalelengths
and anisotropy profiles similar to those seen in cosmological N-body
simulations.

challenging, even for a model Fermi liquid system. We propose a fitting
procedure which allows quantitative access to the intrinsic lineshape,
deconvolved of energy and momentum resolution effects, of the correlated
2-dimensional material Sr2RuO4. For the first time in correlated 2-dimensional
materials, we find an ARPES linewidth that is narrower than its binding energy,
a key property of quasiparticles within Fermi liquid theory. We also find that
when the electron-electron scattering component is separated from the
electron-phonon and impurity scattering terms it decreases with a functional
form compatible with Fermi liquid theory as the Fermi energy is approached. In
combination with the previously determined Fermi surface, these results give
the first complete picture of a Fermi liquid system via ARPES. Furthermore, we
show that the magnitude of the extracted imaginary part of the self-energy is
in remarkable agreement with DC transport measurements.

the joint probability function for the bulk density and current, both for

is non-Gaussian, and while the fluctuations in the current are continuous at
the continuous phase transitions, the density fluctuations are discontinuous.
The derivations are done by using the standard operator algebraic techniques,
and by introducing a modified version of the original operator algebra. As a
byproduct of these considerations we also arrive at a novel and very simple way
of calculating the normalization constant appearing in the standard treatment
with the operator algebra. Like the partition function in equilibrium systems,
this normalization constant is shown to completely characterize the
fluctuations, albeit in a very different manner.

step-edge barrier. For any value of the barrier strength, measured by the
length l_es, nucleation of islands on terraces is always able to destroy
asymptotically step-flow growth. The breakdown of the metastable step-flow
occurs through the formation of a mound of critical width proportional to
L_c=1/sqrt(l_es), the length associated to the linear instability of a
high-symmetry surface. The time required for the destabilization grows
exponentially with L_c. Thermal detachment from steps or islands, or a steeper
slope increase the instability time but do not modify the above picture, nor
change L_c significantly. Standard continuum theories cannot be used to
evaluate the activation energy of the critical mound and the instability time.
The dynamics of a mound can be described as a one dimensional random walk for
its height k: attaining the critical height (i.e. the critical size) means that
the probability to grow (k->k+1) becomes larger than the probability for the
mound to shrink (k->k-1). Thermal detachment induces correlations in the random
walk, otherwise absent.

satisfying solution, there is one whose size, measured in bits, is polynomially
bounded in the size of the formula. In this paper, we consider a special class
of quantifier-free Presburger formulas in which most linear constraints are
difference (separation) constraints, and the non-difference constraints are
sparse. This class has been observed to commonly occur in software
verification. We derive a new solution bound in terms of parameters
characterizing the sparseness of linear constraints and the number of
non-difference constraints, in addition to traditional measures of formula
size. In particular, we show that the number of bits needed per integer
variable is linear in the number of non-difference constraints and logarithmic
in the number and size of non-zero coefficients in them, but is otherwise
independent of the total number of linear constraints in the formula. The
derived bound can be used in a decision procedure based on instantiating
integer variables over a finite domain and translating the input
quantifier-free Presburger formula to an equi-satisfiable Boolean formula,
which is then checked using a Boolean satisfiability solver. In addition to our
main theoretical result, we discuss several optimizations for deriving tighter
bounds in practice. Empirical evidence indicates that our decision procedure
can greatly outperform other decision procedures.

model of nucleon-antinucleon interactions based on G-parity transformation. The
observed proton-antiproton structure is the consequence of the strong
attraction in the singlet S-wave state related predominantly to pion exchanges.
Similar attractions generate near threshold: an isospin-zero virtual (or
quasi-bound) state in singlet S-wave, an isospin-one quasi-bound state in
triplet P-wave with total angular momentum one and an isospin-zero resonance in

with fixed-order perturbative results, to obtain predictions with uniform
theoretical accuracy over the entire range of transverse momenta. The formalism
is applied to Standard Model Higgs boson production at LHC energies. We combine
the most advanced perturbative information available at present for this

fixed-order perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order. The results show a
high stability with respect to perturbative QCD uncertainties.

asexual populations (i.e., quasispecies theory) and related topics. First, the
basic concepts of fitness, mutations, and sequence space are introduced.
Different types of mutation-selection dynamics are defined and their relation
to problems of statistical physics are outlined. Then the stationary population
distribution in simple, single peak fitness landscapes is discussed at length,
with particular emphasis on the error threshold phenomenon. Extensions of the
theory covering e.g. epistatic interactions, diploid organisms,
semiconservative replication and time-dependent fitness peaks are briefly
described. A further section is devoted to randomly rugged fitness landscapes,
which may display fitness correlations of various degree as well as extended
neutral networks. The final two sections address evolutionary dynamics in both
rugged and smooth fitness landscapes, and provide a brief overview of pertinent
experiments.

show that for intense beams of light the detection of the difference
photocurrent may be used, in principle, in order to reveal entanglement, while
the simple measurement of the correlation coefficient is not sufficient. We
have experimentally measured the correlation coefficient and the variance of
the difference photocurrent on several classical and quantum states. Results
are in good agreement with theoretical predictions taking into account the
extra noise in the generated fields that is due to the pump-laser fluctuations.
