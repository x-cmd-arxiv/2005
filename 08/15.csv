(UC) HII region in Mon R2, we have observed a series of mm-wavelength
transitions of C3H2 and C2H. In addition, we have traced the distribution of
other molecules, such as H13CO+, SiO, HCO, and HC3N. These data, together with
the reactive ions recently detected, have been considered to determine the
physical conditions and to model the PDR chemistry. We then identified two kind
of molecules. The first group, formed by the reactive ions (CO+, HOC+) and
small hydrocarbons (C2H, C3H2), traces the surface layers of the PDR and is
presumably exposed to a high UV field (hence we called it as ""high UV"", or
HUV). HUV species is expected to dominate for visual absorptions 2 < Av < 5
mag. A second group (less exposed to the UV field, and hence called ""low UV"",
or LUV) includes HCO and SiO, and is mainly present at the edges of the PDR (Av
> 5 mag). While the abundances of the HUV molecules can be explained by gas
phase models, this is not the case for the studied LUV ones. Although some
efficient gas-phase reactions might be lacking, grain chemistry sounds like a
probable mechanism able to explain the observed enhancement of HCO and SiO.
Within this scenario, the interaction of UV photons with grains produces an
important effect on the molecular gas chemistry and constitutes the first
evidence of an ionization front created by the UC HII region carving its host
molecular cloud. The physical conditions and kinematics of the gas layer which
surrounds the UC HII region were derived from the HUV molecules. Molecular
hydrogen densities > 4 10^6 cm^(-3) are required to reproduce the observations.
Such high densities suggest that the HII region could be pressure-confined by
the surrounding high density molecular gas.

purpose of GRAPE is to measure the polarization of hard X-rays in the 50-300
keV energy range. We are particularly interested in X-rays that are emitted
from solar flares and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Accurately measuring the
polarization of the emitted radiation from these sources will lead, to a better
understating of both the emission mechanisms and source geometries. The GRAPE
design consists of an array of plastic scintillators surrounding a central
high-Z crystal scintillator. We can monitor individual Compton scatters that
occur in the plastics and determine whether the photon is photo absorbed by the
high-Z crystal or not. A Compton scattered photon that is immediately photo
absorbed by the high-Z crystal constitutes a valid event. These valid events
provide us with the interaction locations of each incident photon and
ultimately produces a modulation pattern for the Compton scattering of the
polarized radiation. Comparing with Monte Carlo simulations of a 100% polarized
beam, the level of polarization of the measured beam can then be determined.
The complete array is mounted on a flat-panel multi-anode photomultiplier tube
(MAPMT) that can measure the deposited energies resulting from the photon
interactions. The design of the detector allows for a large field-of-view (>pi
steradian), at the same time offering the ability to be close-packed with
multiple modules in order to reduce deadspace. We plan to present in this paper
the latest laboratory results obtained from GRAPE using partially polarized
radiation sources.

scanning altogether 2.6 million triangular configurations. Estimating
covariances from Gaussian signal plus realistic noise simulations, we perform a
null-hypothesis testing with regards to the Gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave

consistent with Gaussianity. To quantify the level of possible deviations, we
introduce false discovery rate analysis, a novel statistical technique to
analyze for three-point measurements. This confirms that the data are
consistent with Gaussianity at better than 1-$\sigma$ level when jointly
considering all configurations. We constrain a specific non-Gaussian model
using the quadratic approximation of weak non-Gaussianities in terms of the
$f_{NLT}$ parameter, for which we construct an estimator from the the

  In some galaxies, distinct rings of HI emission coincide with regions of

For the double neutron star binary J1829+2456, in addition to improving upon
our existing measurement of relativistic periastron advance, we have now
measured the pulsar's spin period derivative. This new result sets an upper
limit on the transverse speed of 120 km/s and a lower limit on the
characteristic age of 12.4 Gyr. From our measurement of proper motion of the
isolated 5.2-ms pulsar J1944+0907, we infer a transverse speed of 188 +/- 65

of an applied electric field, is calculated using different theoretical
formulations. First the lowest order screening expression derived by Sham
(1975) is evaluated. In addition 'exact' expressions are evaluated which were
derived according to different approaches. For a proton in a metal modeled as a
jellium the screening appears to be 15 +/- 10 %, which is neither negligible
not reconcilable with the controversial full-screening point of view of
Bosvieux and Friedel (1962). In reconsidering the theory of electromigration, a
new simplified linear-response expression for the driving force is shown to
lead to essentially the same result as found by Sorbello (1985), who has used a
rather complicated technique. The expressions allow for a reduction such that
only the scattering phase shifts of the migrating impurity are required.
Finally it is shown that the starting formula for the driving force of Bosvieux
and Friedel leads exactly to the zero-temperature limit of well-established
linear response descriptions, by which the sting of the controversy has been
removed.

using low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes. In particular, this paper
addresses the problem of encoding a Bernoulli(0.5) source: for randomly
generated LDGM codes with suitably irregular degree distributions, our methods
yield performance very close to the rate distortion limit over a range of
rates. Our approach is inspired by the survey propagation (SP) algorithm,
originally developed by Mezard et al. for solving random satisfiability
problems. Previous work by Maneva et al. shows how SP can be understood as
belief propagation (BP) for an alternative representation of satisfiability
problems. In analogy to this connection, our approach is to define a family of
Markov random fields over generalized codewords, from which local
message-passing rules can be derived in the standard way. The overall source
encoding method is based on message-passing, setting a subset of bits to their
preferred values (decimation), and reducing the code.

assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We
prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions
share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any
such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original

Motivated by such examples, we consider the number of inversions of a

is the number of pairs $(i,j)$ with $1\leq i < j \leq n$ and $\pi(i)>\pi(j)$.
The number of descents is the number of $i$ in the range $1\leq i < n$ such

are ellipses of eccentricity $e$ with the primary of mass 1 located at one of
the focii. If the period is a rational multiple of $2\pi$, denoted $2\pi p/q$,
some of these orbits perturb to periodic motions for $\mu > 0$. For typical

which yields itself to applications to several fields like coding or
communication theory, Markov chains, representation of groups and graphs,
Leontief economic models and so on. This book has for the first time,
introduced a new algebraic structure called linear bialgebra, which is also a
very powerful algebraic tool that can yield itself to applications. With the
recent introduction of bimatrices (2005)we have ventured in this book to
introduce new concepts like linear bialgebra and Smarandache neutrosophic
linear bialgebra and also give the applications of these algebraic structures.
  It is important to mention here it is a matter of simple exercise to extend
these to linear n-algebra for any n greater than 2; for n = 2 we get the linear
bialgebra. This book has five chapters. In the first chapter we just introduce
some basic notions of linear algebra and Slinear algebra and their
applications. Chapter two introduces some new algebraic bistructures. In
chapter three we introduce the notion of linear bialgebra and discuss several
interesting properties about them. Also, application of linear bialgebra to
bicodes is given. A remarkable part of our research in this book is the
introduction of the notion of birepresentation of bigroups. The fourth chapter
introduces several neutrosophic algebraic structures since they help in
defining the new concept of neutrosophic linear bialgebra, neutrosophic
bivector spaces, Smarandache neutrosophic linear bialgebra and Smarandache
neutrosophic bivector spaces. Theirprobable applications to real-world models
are discussed.
