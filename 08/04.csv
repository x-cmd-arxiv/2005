The goals of the observations were to investigate any correlation between

attempt to determine whether these objects are powered by starbursts or active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). The sample contains approximately the same number of
high and low luminosity objects and ``warm'' and ``cool'' ULIRGs. All 14
galaxies were detected by Chandra. Our analysis shows that the X-ray emission
of the two Seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample are dominated by AGN. The remaining
12 sources are too faint for conventional spectral fitting to be applicable.
Hardness ratios were used to estimate the spectral properties of these faint
sources. The photon indices for our sample plus the Chandra-observed sample
from Ptak et al.(2003) peak in the range of 1.0-1.5, consistent with
expectations for X-ray binaries in a starburst, an absorbed AGN, or hot
bremsstrahlung from a starburst or AGN. The values of photon index for the
objects in our sample classified as Seyferts (type 1 or 2) are larger than 2,
while those classified as HII regions or LINERs tend to be less than 2. The
hard X-ray to far-infrared ratios for the 12 weak sources are similar to those
of starbursts, but we cannot rule out the possibility of absorbed, possibly
Compton-thick, AGNs in some of these objects. Two of these faint sources were
found to have X-ray counterparts to their double optical and infrared nuclei.

2MASS counterpart (K=5.3mag) was found for IRAS 18299--1705. Its blue colour
H--K=1.3 suggests that IRAS 8299--1705 is a post-AGB star. A couple of GLMP
sources have faint but relatively blue counterparts. They might be misidentifed
field stars or stars hich experienced recently a drop of their mass loss rates.
The `GLMP sample' in general is made of oxygen-rich AGB stars, which are highly
obscured by their circumstellar shells. They belong to the same population as
the reddest OH/IR stars in the `Arecibo sample'.

  Publications Series",,"10.1051/eas:2006049",,"astro-ph",,"  Observational evidence indicates a mismatch between the shapes of
collisionless dark matter (DM) halos and those of observed systems. Using
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations we investigate the effect of baryonic
dissipation on halo shapes. We show that dissipational simulations produce
significantly rounder halos than those formed in equivalent dissipationless
simulations. Gas cooling causes an average increase in halo principal axis
ratios of ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions and a systematic shift that persists
out to the virial radius, alleviating any tension between theory and
observations. Although the magnitude of the effect may be overestimated due to
overcooling, cluster formation simulations designed to reproduce the observed
fraction of cold baryons still produce substantially rounder halos. Subhalos
also exhibit a trend of increased axis ratios in dissipational simulations.
Moreover, we demonstrate that subhalos are generally rounder than corresponding
field halos even in dissipationless simulations. Lastly, we analyze a series of
binary, equal-mass merger simulations of disk galaxies. Collisionless mergers
reveal a strong correlation between DM halo shape and stellar remnant
morphology. In dissipational mergers, the combination of strong gas inflows and
star formation leads to an increase of the DM axis ratios in the remnant. All
of these results highlight the vital role of baryonic processes in comparing
theory with observations and warn against over-interpreting discrepancies with
collisionless simulations on small scales.

HS1700+6416, to explore the effects of galaxy formation feedback on the IGM.
Our observations and ionization simulations indicate that the volume within
100-200 h_71^{-1} physical kpc of high-redshift galaxies contains very small,
dense, and metal-rich absorption-line regions. These systems often contain
shock-heated gas seen in OVI, and may exhibit [Si/C] abundance enhancements
suggestive of Type II supernova enrichment. We argue that the absorbers
resemble thin sheets or bubbles, whose physical properties can be explained
with a simple model of radiatively efficient shocks propegating through the
IGM. Their high metallicities suggest that these shocks are being expelled
from--rather than falling into--star forming galaxies. There is a dropoff in
the IGM gas density at galaxy impact parameters beyond ~300 physical kpc that
may trace boundaries of gas structures where the galaxies reside. The local
heavy-element enhancement covers 100-200 kpc; beyond this the observed
abundances blend into the general IGM. Supernova-driven winds or dynamical
stripping of interstellar gas appears to affect the IGM near massive galaxies,
even at R>~100 kpc. However, these feedback systems represent only a few
percent of the Lya forest mass at z~2.5. Their mass could be larger if the more
numerous metal-poor CIV systems at >~200 kpc are tepid remnants of very
powerful winds. Based on present observations it is not clear that this
scenario is to be favored over one involving pre-enrichment by smaller galaxies
at z>~6.

of thermal conduction, and find that the resulting profiles of temperature and
entropy are consistent with observations. Unlike previously proposed models,
our model predicts that isentropic cores are not an inevitable consequence of
preheating. The model also reproduces the observational trend for the density
profiles to flatten in lower mass systems. We deduce the energy E_agn required
to explain the entropy observations as a function of mass of groups and
clusters M_cl and show that E_agn is proportional to M_cl^alpha with alpha~1.5.
We demonstrate that the entropy measurements, in conjunction with our model,
can be translated into constraints on the cluster--black hole mass relation.
The inferred relation is nonlinear and has the form M_bh\propto M_cl^alpha.
This scaling is an analog and extension of a similar relation between the black
hole mass and the galactic halo mass that holds on smaller scales. We show that
the central decrement of the CMB temperature is reduced due to the enhanced
entropy of the ICM, and that the decrement predicted from the plausible range
of energy input from the AGN is consistent with available data of SZ decrement.
We show that AGN heating, combined with the observational constraints on
entropy, leads to suppression of higher multipole moments in the angular power
spectrum and we find that this effect is stronger than previously thought.

a primordial black hole (PBH) in a flat Friedmann background. Such solutions
arise if a Schwarzschild black hole is patched onto a Friedmann background via
a transition region. They are possible providing the black hole event horizon
is larger than the cosmological apparent horizon. Such solutions have a number
of strange features. In particular, one has to define the black hole and
cosmological horizons carefully and one then finds that the mass contained
within the black hole event horizon decreases when it is larger than the
Friedmann cosmological apparent horizon, although its area always increases.
These solutions involve two distinct future null infinities and are interpreted
as the conversion of a white hole into a black hole. Although such solutions
may not form from gravitational collapse in the same way as standard PBHs,
there is nothing unphysical about them, since all energy and causality
conditions are satisfied. Their conformal diagram is a natural amalgamation of
the Kruskal diagram for the extended Schwarzschild solution and the conformal
diagram for a black hole in a flat Friedmann background. In this paper, such
solutions are obtained numerically for a spherically symmetric universe
containing a massless scalar field, but it is likely that they exist for more
general matter fields and less symmetric systems.

obtained more stringent positional constraints on this HE source and
constructed its spectrum in the range 20-400 keV. Furthermore, by combining the
Isgri spectrum with the total X-ray spectrum corresponding to the same physical
region around SgrA* from XMM data, and collected during part of the Integral
observations, we constructed and present the first accurate wide band HE
spectrum for the central arcmins of the Galaxy. Our complete analysis of the
emission properties of IGR shows that it is faint but persistent with no
variability above 3 sigma contrary to what was alluded to in our first paper.
This result, in conjunction with the spectral characteristics of the X-ray
emission from this region, suggests that the source is most likely not
point-like but, rather, that it is a compact, yet diffuse, non-thermal emission
region. The centroid of IGR is estimated to be R.A.=17h45m42.5,
decl.=-28deg59'28'', offset by 1' from the radio position of Sgr A* and with a

within 1' of Sgr A*. We present arguments in favor of an interpretation
according to which the photons detected by Integral and Hess arise from the
same compact region of diffuse emission near the central BH and that the
supernova remnant Sgr A East could play an important role as a contributor of
very HE g-rays to the overall spectrum from this region.

observed with the CCD detector EPIC-pn, is well detected up to ~7 arcmin and
contributes ~5-7% to the total source emission at 1 keV, depending on the dust
size distribution model considered. For the first time spatially resolved
spectroscopy of a scattering halo is performed. In the halo spectrum we clearly
detect the signature of the interstellar dust elements: O, Mg, and Si. The
spectral modeling of the halo shows a major contribution of silicates (olivine
and pyroxene). The spatial analysis of the halo shows that the dust is smoothly
distributed toward Cyg X-2 at least for ~60% of the path to the source. Within
the instrumental limits, the data do not show preference for a specific dust
size distribution; namely the Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsieck (1977) or the

differential scattering cross section. The RGS data were used to investigate
the ISM absorption, in particular the region of the oxygen edge. Combining the
RGS results with the information on dust grains provided by the EPIC-pn
spectrum of the halo we estimate a column density for dust absorption by
oxygen, provided that it is locked in silicate grains (abridged).

particles possessing attractions of short range and arbitrary strength and
geometry, an important realization being self-assembling particles endowed with
strong, short-ranged and angularly specific (`patchy') attractions. Standard
Monte Carlo techniques employ sequential updates of particles and suffer from
low acceptance rates when attractions are strong. Our algorithm avoids this
slowing-down by proposing simultaneous moves of collections (clusters) of
particles according to gradients of interaction energies. One particle first
executes a `virtual' trial move. We determine which of its neighbours move in a
similar fashion by calculating individual bond energies before and after the
proposed move. We iterate this procedure and update simultaneously the
positions of all affected particles. Particles move according to an
approximation of realistic dynamics without requiring the explicit computation
of forces, and without the step size restrictions required when integrating
equations of motion. We also employ a size- and shape-dependent hydrodynamic
damping of cluster movements. We discuss the virtual-move algorithm in the
context of other Monte Carlo cluster-move schemes, and demonstrate its utility
by applying it to a model of biological self-assembly.

that there is hopping-like motion present in the simulations, and this motion
is not predicted by the mode-coupling theory. The wave vector dependent
relaxation time is shown to be qualitatively different than the predictions of
the mode-coupling theory for temperatures where hopping-like motion is present.

tackle regimes where Coulomb interaction very effectively mixes many

various non-analytic dependencies of the quantum corrections on H and D. It is
also demonstrated that, quite generally, the DM interaction suppresses quantum

conductance (SHC), extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit, remains finite in a

intrinsic spin Hall accumulation as induced by an external electric field once
the disorder is turned on. The latter is examined by performing a Laughlin's
Gedanken gauge experiment numerically with the adiabatical insertion of a flux
quantum in a belt-shaped sample, in which the absence of level crossing is
found under the disorder effect. Without disorder, on the other hand, energy
levels do cross each other, which results in an oscillating
spin-density-modulation at the sample boundary after the insertion of one flux
quantum in the belt-shaped system. But the corresponding net spin transfer is
only about one order of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the bulk
SHC. These apparently contradictory results can be attributed to the violation
of the spin conservation law in such a system. We also briefly address the
dissipative Fermi surface contribution to spin polarization, which may be
relevant to experimental measurements.

distributed environments is one of the primary challenges in the field of
multi-agent systems. A lot of interest has surfaced recently around self-*
(self-organizing, self-managing, self-optimizing, self-protecting) agents. This
paper presents polymorphic self-* agents that evolve a core set of roles and
behavior based on environmental cues. The agents adapt these roles based on the
changing demands of the environment, and are directly implementable in computer
systems applications. The design combines strategies from game theory,
stigmergy, and other biologically inspired models to address fault mitigation
in large-scale, real-time, distributed systems. The agents are embedded within
the individual digital signal processors of BTeV, a High Energy Physics
experiment consisting of 2500 such processors. Results obtained using a SWARM
simulation of the BTeV environment demonstrate the polymorphic character of the
agents, and show how this design exceeds performance and reliability metrics
obtained from comparable centralized, and even traditional decentralized
approaches.

network applications and protocols. Thus, recently there has been tremendous
interest in generating realistic network topologies. Such work must begin with
an understanding of existing network topologies, which today typically consists
of a relatively small number of data sources. In this paper, we calculate an
extensive set of important characteristics of Internet AS-level topologies
extracted from the three data sources most frequently used by the research
community: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS. We find that traceroute and BGP
topologies are similar to one another but differ substantially from the WHOIS
topology. We discuss the interplay between the properties of the data sources
that result from specific data collection mechanisms and the resulting topology
views. We find that, among metrics widely considered, the joint degree
distribution appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS-topologies: it
narrowly defines values for other important metrics. We also introduce an
evaluation criteria for the accuracy of topology generators and verify previous
observations that generators solely reproducing degree distributions cannot
capture the full spectrum of critical topological characteristics of any of the
three topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input topology
datasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations. This
supplement should enable researchers to validate their models against real data
and to make more informed selection of topology data sources for their specific
needs.

  Theory, Adelaide, Sept. 4-9, 2005",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The cutoff rate $R_0(W)$ of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) $W$ is often
used as a figure of merit, alongside the channel capacity $C(W)$. Given a
channel $W$ consisting of two possibly correlated subchannels $W_1$, $W_2$, the
capacity function always satisfies $C(W_1)+C(W_2) \le C(W)$, while there are
examples for which $R_0(W_1)+R_0(W_2) > R_0(W)$. This fact that cutoff rate can
be ``created'' by channel splitting was noticed by Massey in his study of an
optical modulation system modeled as a $M$'ary erasure channel. This paper
demonstrates that similar gains in cutoff rate can be achieved for general
DMC's by methods of channel combining and splitting. Relation of the proposed
method to Pinsker's early work on cutoff rate improvement and to Imai-Hirakawa
multi-level coding are also discussed.

to address the problem of the fermion mass hierarchy, and in particular the

warped flux compactification scenario for brane-antibrane inflation in Type IIB

(approximated as zero by KKLMMT), namely the position of the antibrane,
relative to the equilibrium position of the brane in the absence of the
antibrane. We show that for a range of values of a particular combination of
the Kahler modulus, warp factor, and psi_0, the inflaton potential can be
sufficiently flat. We point out a novel mechanism for dynamically achieving
flatness within this part of parameter space: the presence of multiple mobile
branes can lead to a potential which initially has a metastable local minimum,
but gradually becomes flat as some of the branes tunnel out. Eventually the
local minimum disappears and the remaining branes slowly roll together, with
assisted inflation further enhancing the effective flatness of the potential.
With the addition of Kahler and superpotential corrections, this mechanism can
completely remove the fine tuning problem of brane inflation, within large
regions of parameter space. The model can be falsified if future cosmic
microwave background observations confirm the hint of a large running spectral
index.

Such circular Radon transform arises in several contemporary imaging

Range descriptions for such transforms are known to be very important for
computed tomography, for instance when dealing with incomplete data, error
correction, and other issues. A complete range description for the circular
Radon transform is obtained. Range conditions include the recently found set of
moment type conditions, which happens to be incomplete, as well as the rest of

better, a similar (non-standard) treatment of the range conditions is described

Extra examples and results added; further typos corrected",,,"UKC/IMS/05/11","math.NT math.CO",,"  Somos 4 sequences are a family of sequences defined by a fourth-order
quadratic recurrence relation with constant coefficients.For particular choices
of the coefficients and the four initial data, such recurrences can yield
sequences of integers. Fomin and Zelevinsky have used the theory of cluster
algebras to prove that these recurrences also provide one of the simplest
examples of the Laurent phenomenon: all the terms of a Somos 4 sequence are
Laurent polynomials in the initial data. The integrality of certain Somos 4
sequences has previously been understood in terms of the Laurent phenomenon.
However, each of the authors of this paper has independently established the
precise correspondence between Somos 4 sequences and sequences of points on
elliptic curves. Here we show that these sequences satisfy a stronger condition
than the Laurent property, and hence establish a broad set of sufficient
conditions for integrality. As a by-product, non-periodic sequences provide
infinitely many solutions of an associated quartic Diophantine equation in four
variables. The analogous results for Somos 5 sequences are also presented, as
well as various examples, including parameter families of Somos 4 integer
sequences.

an arbitrary spherically symmetric charge distribution is completely solved up
to the first order in the acceleration. No ad hoc assumptions are made. It is
shown that most of the puzzles that this problem has aroused are due to the
inertia of the negative pressure that equilibrates the electrostatic repulsion
inside the particle. When the inertia of pressure is taken into account the
dressed mass turns out to be the bare mass plus the electrostatic mass m=m_0 +
m_e. It is shown that a proper mechanical behaviour requires that m_0 > m_e/3.
This condition poses a lower bound on the radius that a particle of a given
bare mass and charge may have. The violation of this condition is the reason
why the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac formula for the radiation reaction of a point
charge predicts unphysical motions that run away or violate causality. Provided
the mass condition is met the solutions of the exact equation of motion never
run away and conform to causality and energy and momentum conservation. When
the radius is much smaller than the wave-length of the radiated fields, but the
mass condition is still met, the exact expression reduces to the formula that
was advocated recently by Rohrlich.
