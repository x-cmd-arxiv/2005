process by photons provided by the first luminous sources. Investigating the
transient regime at the onset of inhomogeneous reionisation, we show that
magnetic field amplitudes as high as $2 \times 10^{-16}$ Gauss can be obtained

accelerate electrons, inducing magnetic fields outside the Stroemgren spheres
which surround the ionising sources. Thanks to their mean free path, photons
with higher energies propagate further and lead to magnetic field generation
deeper in the neutral medium. We find that soft X-ray photons could contribute
to a significant premagnetisation of the intergalactic medium at a redshift of

the cosmic near infrared background. We present detailed calculations of its
spectrum with various assumptions about metallicity and mass spectrum of early
stars. We show that if the near infrared background has a stellar origin,
metal-free stars are not the only explanation of the excess near infrared
background; stars with metals (e.g. Z=1/50 Z_sun) can produce the same amount
of background intensity as the metal-free stars. We quantitatively show that
the predicted average intensity at 1-2 microns is essentially determined by the
efficiency of nuclear burning in stars, which is not very sensitive to
metallicity. We predict \nu I_\nu / \dot{\rho}_* ~ 4-8 nW m^-2 sr^-1, where
\dot{\rho_*} is the mean star formation rate at z=7-15 (in units of M_sun yr^-1
Mpc^-3) for stars more massive than 5 M_sun. On the other hand, since we have
very little knowledge about the form of mass spectrum of early stars,
uncertainty in the average intensity due to the mass spectrum could be large.
An accurate determination of the near infrared background allows us to probe
formation history of early stars, which is difficult to constrain by other
means. While the star formation rate at z=7-15 inferred from the current data
is significantly higher than the local rate at z<5, it does not rule out the
stellar origin of the cosmic near infrared background. In addition, we show
that a reasonable initial mass function, coupled with this star formation rate,
does not over-produce metals in the universe in most cases, and may produce as
little as less than 1 % of the metals observed in the universe today.

rapidly rotating, massive stars, including stripped down helium cores that

rotate unusually rapidly on the main sequence. For the highest possible
rotation rates (about 400 km/s), a novel sort of evolution is encountered in
which single stars mix completely on the main sequence, never becoming red
giants. Such stars, essentially massive ""blue stragglers"", produce
helium-oxygen cores that rotate unusually rapidly. Such stars might comprise
roughly 1% of all stars above 10 solar masses and can, under certain

fuel to trigger superbursts. Our models span the plausible ranges of neutron
star thermal conductivities, core neutrino emission mechanisms, and areal
radii, as well as the CNO abundances in the accreted material. We find that
neutron stars that accrete hydrogen-rich material with CNO mass fractions <~
that of the Sun will not exhibit superbursts under any circumstances. Neutron
stars that accrete material with CNO mass fractions >~ 4 times that of the Sun
will exhibit superbursts at accretion rates in the observed range. On this
basis, we suggest that the mass donors of superburst systems must have enhanced
CNO abundances. The accreted CNO acts only as a catalyst for hydrogen burning
via the hot CNO cycle, and therefore it is only the sum of the three elements'
mass fractions that is important. Systems that exhibit superbursts are observed
to differ from those that do not exhibit superbursts in the nature of their
helium-triggered Type I X-ray bursts: the bursts have shorter durations and
much greater alpha-values. Increasing the CNO abundance of the accreted
material in our models reproduces both of these observations. Many compact
binary systems have been observed in which the abundances of the accreting
material are distinctly non-solar. Though abundance analyses of the systems
that exhibit superbursts currently do not exist, Bowen fluorescence blend
profiles of 4U 1636-536 and Ser X-1 suggest that the mass donor stars may
indeed have non-solar CNO metallicities. More detailed abundance analyses of
the accreting matter in systems that exhibit superbursts are needed to verify
our assertion that the matter is rich in CNO elements.

distributions All the BCGs show population gradients, with much higher relative
numbers of red clusters within 5 kpc of their centers, consistent with their
having formed at later times than the blue, metal-poor population. A striking
new feature of the color distributions emerging from our data is that for the
brightest clusters (M_I < -10.5) the color distribution becomes broad and less
obviously bimodal. we suggest that it may be a characteristic of many BCGs.
Furthermore, the blue (metal-poor) clusters become progressively redder with
increasing luminosity, following a mass/metallicity scaling relation Z ~
M^0.55. We argue that these GCS characteristics are consistent with a
hierarchical-merging formation picture in which the metal-poor clusters formed
in protogalactic clouds or dense starburst complexes with gas masses in the
range 10^7 - 10^10 M_Sun, but where the more massive clusters on average formed
in bigger clouds with deeper potential wells where more pre-enrichment could

furthermore measure the central concentrations and asymmetries of all 37 host

Deep Field. Our first main conclusion is that GRB hosts exhibit a surprisingly
high diversity of galaxy types. A significant fraction (68%) of host galaxies
are situated in a region of the concentration-asymmetry diagram occupied by
spirals or peculiar/merging galaxies. Twelve hosts (32%) are situated in the
region occupied by elliptical galaxies, having high concentration indices. We
also find some evidence for evolution in GRB host galaxy morphology, such that
hosts at z > 1 have a relatively high light concentration, indicating that
these systems are perhaps progenitors of massive galaxies, or are compact blue
star forming galaxies. We find that GRB hosts at z > 1 are different from the
general field population at z > 1 in terms of light concentration at >99.5%
confidence, yet have sizes similar to the general z > 1 population. This is the
opposite of the effect at z < 1 where GRB hosts are smaller than average. We
argue that GRB hosts trace the starburst population at high redshift, as
similarly concentrated galaxies at z > 1 are undergoing a disproportionate
amount of star formation for their luminosities. Our results show that GRBs are
perhaps ideal tracers of typical galaxies undergoing star formation at any

explained in a model where the HI ionization rate is dominated by the combined
UV emission from young star forming galaxies and QSOs and the HeII ionization
rate is dominated by emission from QSOs only. In such a model the large
fluctuations in the column density ratio are due to the small number of QSOs
expected to contribute at any given point to the HeII ionization rate. A
significant contribution to UV emission at the HeII photoelectric edge from hot
gas in galaxies and galaxy groups would decrease the expected fluctuations in
the column density ratio. Consequently, this model appears difficult to
reconcile with the large increase in HeII opacity fluctuations towards higher

based on application of artificial neural networks, regressions, and synthesis
models to medium-resolution (1-2 A) spectra and J-K colors. We calibrate this
method by comparison with metallicities and carbon abundance determinations for
118 stars with available high-resolution analyses reported in the recent
literature. The neural network and regression approaches make use of a
previously defined set of line-strength indices quantifying the strength of the
CaII K line and the CH G-band, in conjuction with J-K colors from the 2MASS
Point Source Catalog. The use of near-IR colors, as opposed to broadband B-V
colors, is required because of the potentially large affect of strong molecular
carbon bands on bluer color indices. Using these methods we are able to
reproduce the previously-measured [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] determinations with an
accuracy of ~ 0.25 dex for stars in the metallicity interval -5.5 <= [Fe/H]} <=
-1.0, and with 0.2 <= (J-K)o <= 0.8. At higher metallicity the CaII K line
begins to saturate, especially for the cool stars in our program, hence this
approach is not useful in some cases. As a first application, we estimate the
abundances of [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] for the 56 stars identified as possibly
carbon-rich, relative to stars of similar metal abundance, in the sample of

Explorer (RXTE). We detect an 84 Hz oscillation (QPO) during a 1 s interval
beginning approximately 1 min after the initial hard spike. The modulation
amplitude is energy dependent, reaching a maximum of 26% (rms) for photons
above 30 keV, and is not detected below 11 keV, with a 90% confidence upper
limit of 14% (rms). Remarkably, additional QPOs are detected in the average
power spectrum of data segments centered on the rotational phase at which the
84 Hz signal was detected. Two signals, at 53.5 and 155.1 Hz, are strongly
detected, while a third feature at 28 Hz is found with lower significance.
These QPOs are not detected at other rotational phases. The phenomenology seen
in the SGR 1900+14 flare is similar to that of QPOs recently reported by Israel
et al. from the December 27, 2004 flare from SGR 1806-20, suggesting they may
have a common origin, perhaps torsional vibrations of the neutron star crust.
Indeed, an association of the four frequencies (in increasing order) found in
SGR 1900+14 with l = 2, 4, 7, and 13 toroidal modes appears plausible. We
discuss our findings in the context of this model and show that if the stars
have similar masses then the magnetic field in SGR 1806-20 must be about twice
as large as in SGR 1900+14, broadly consistent with magnetic field estimates

properties of the cluster member galaxies. We measure the LX-sigma relation
from the correlated dataset and find it to be consistent with recent results
found in the literature. Using a sample of 19 clusters with LX>=0.36*10^44 erg
s^-1 in the (0.1-2.4 keV) band, and 49 clusters with lower X-ray luminosity, we
find that the fraction of early spectral type (eta<=-1.4), passively-evolving
galaxies is significantly higher in the high-LX sample within R200. We extend
the investigation to include composite bJ cluster luminosity functions, and
find that the characteristic magnitude of the Schechter-function fit to the
early-type luminosity function is fainter for the high-LX sample compared to
the low-LX sample (Delta M*=0.58+/-0.14). This seems to be driven by a deficit
of such galaxies with M_bJ ~ -21. In contrast, we find no significant
differences between the luminosity functions of star-forming, late-type
galaxies. We believe these results are consistent with a scenario in which the
high-LX clusters are more dynamically evolved systems than the low-LX clusters.

photoassociation of a quantum gas, although this process has not yet been shown
to produce a quantum degenerate molecular gas. In principle, Feshbach resonance
and Raman photoassociation can be quantum-mechanically reversible, and lead to
collective coherent phenomena such as Rabi cycling between an atomic and a

realized experimentally. Effects that may limit coherence include thermalizing
elastic collisions, inelastic collisions, spontaneous Raman scattering, and
pairing field formation. Here, we demonstrate a method that circumvents these

driven into a Mott insulator state. We find that the Raman photoassociation
transition is resolved into discrete lines corresponding to the quantized
lattice site occupancies, and demonstrate that this provides a new method to
accurately determine the distribution of site occupancies and the atom-molecule

S=1/2, however, the linear spin wave approximation breaks down. In this case,
we have studied the effect of dilution on the staggered magnetization using the
Stochastic Series Expansion Monte Carlo method. Two main results are to be
stressed from the Monte Carlo method: (i) a better value for the staggered
magnetization of the undiluted system, m=0.2677(6); (ii) a finite value of the
staggered magnetization of the percolating cluster at the classical percolation
threshold, showing that there is no quantum critical transition driven by

cuprates, we use Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory to compute zero
temperature properties of the two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The
d-wave order parameter is found to scale like the superexchange coupling J for
on-site interaction U comparable to or larger than the bandwidth. The order
parameter also assumes a dome shape as a function of doping while, by contrast,
the gap in the single-particle density of states decreases monotonically with
increasing doping. In the presence of a finite second-neighbor hopping t', the
zero temperature phase diagram displays the electron-hole asymmetric
competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity that is observed
experimentally in the cuprates. Adding realistic third-neighbor hopping t''
improves the overall agreement with the experimental phase diagram. Since band
parameters can vary depending on the specific cuprate considered, the
sensitivity of the theoretical phase diagram to band parameters challenges the
commonly held assumption that the doping vs T_{c}/T_{c}^{max} phase diagram of
the cuprates is universal. The calculated ARPES spectrum displays the observed
electron-hole asymmetry. Our calculations reproduce important features of
d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates that would otherwise be considered
anomalous from the point of view of the standard BCS approach.

in the presence of transport a resistance that governs the displacement

either the polarization of the exciting light is changed from circular to
linear or the transverse magnetic field of ~300 gauss (G) is applied. The
interband absorption of the circularly polarized light results in a spin
polarization of conduction electrons, which reaches 35% with increasing the
pump intensity. The effects observed are explained by dynamical polarization of
deep paramagnetic centers and spin-dependent capture of conduction electrons by
these centers. The PL depolarization in a transverse magnetic field (Hanle

1 ns. Theoretically, it has been concluded that, due to the SDR, this long time

effects of a mixing with higher-lying spin multiplets, which is produced by
anisotropic interactions and is neglected in the standard single-spin
description, are investigated systematically for the two experimental
techniques of inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR), with emphasis on the former technique. The spectroscopic
transition intensities are calculated analytically by constructing
corresponding effective spin operators perturbationally up to second order and
consequently using irreducible tensor operator techniques. Three main effects
of spin mixing are observed. Firstly, a pronounced dependence of the INS
intensities on the momentum transfer Q, with a typical oscillatory behavior,
emerges in first order, signaling the many-spin nature of the wave functions in
exchange-coupled clusters. Secondly, as compared to the results of a
first-order calculation, the intensities of the transitions within the spin
multiplet are affected differently by spin mixing. This allows one, thirdly, to
differentiate the higher-order contributions to the cluster magnetic anisotropy
which come from the single-ion ligand-field terms and spin mixing,
respectively. The analytical results are illustrated by means of the three

their effectualness (i.e. larger overlaps with the exact signal), and
faithfulness (i.e. smaller biases while measuring the parameters of the signal)
with the exact (numerical) waveforms. We find that in the case of prograde

P-approximants achieve effectualness of > 0.99 for all spins up to q = 0.95.
The bias in the estimation of parameters is much lower in the case of
P-approximants than T-approximants. We find that P-approximants are both
effectual and faithful and should be more effective than T-approximants as a
detection template family when q > 0. For q < 0 both T- and P-approximants
perform equally well so that either of them could be used as a detection
template family. However, for parameter estimation, the P-approximant templates
still outperforms the T-approximants.

make some remarks on the applicability and validity of this general on-shell
quantization method. We then obtain an expression for the symplectic form on
the moduli space of LLM configurations, and show that it exactly coincides with
the one expected from the dual fermion picture. This equivalence is shown for
any shape and topology of the droplets and for any number of droplets. This
work therefore generalizes the previous work (hep-th/0505079) and resolves the
puzzle encountered there.

a functional analogue to the Gauss quadrature technique for one-dimensional
functions. In PRE 69, 056701 (2004), it has been argued that the problem of
designing an approximation of order \nu is equivalent to the problem of
constructing discrete-time Gaussian processes that are supported on
finite-dimensional probability spaces and match certain generalized moments of
the Brownian motion. Since Gaussian processes are uniquely determined by their
covariance matrix, it is tempting to reformulate the moment-matching problem in
terms of the covariance matrix alone. Here, we show how this can be
accomplished.

over Q. By the Birch and Swinnerton Dyer Conjecture and Silverman's
Specialization Theorem, for t sufficiently large the L-function of each curve
E_t in the family has r zeros (called the family zeros) at the central point.
We observe experimentally a repulsion of the zeros near the central point, and
the repulsion increases with r. There is greater repulsion in the subset of
curves of rank r+2 than in the subset of curves of rank r in a rank r family.
For curves with comparable conductors, the behavior of rank 2 curves in a rank
0 one-parameter family over Q is statistically different from that of rank 2
curves from a rank 2 family. Unlike excess rank calculations, the repulsion
decreases markedly as the conductors increase, and we conjecture that the r
family zeros do not repel in the limit. Finally, the differences between
adjacent normalized zeros near the central point are statistically independent
of the repulsion, family rank and rank of the curves in the subset.
Specifically, the differences between adjacent normalized zeros are
statistically equal for all curves investigated with rank 0, 2 or 4 and
comparable conductors from one-parameter families of rank 0 or 2 over Q.

calculate the fundamental limits of the dispersion of the two-photon absorption
cross-section. A comparison of the theory with the data suggests that the
truncated sum rules in the three-level model give a reasonable fundamental
limit. Our ansatz that the two photon absorption cross-section near the limit
must have only three dominant statesis is supported by a rigorous analytical
calculation that the resonant term gets smaller as more states are added. We
also find that the contributions of the non-explicitly resonant terms can not
be neglected when analyzing real molecules with many excited states, even near
resonance. However, puzzling as it may be, extrapolating an off-resonant result
to resonance using only the resonant term of the three-level model is shown to
be consistent with the exact result. In addition, the off-resonant
approximation is shown to scale logarithmically when compared with the full
three-level model. This scaling can be used to simplify the analysis of
measurements. We find that existing molecules are still far from the
fundamental limit; so, there is room for improvement. But, reaching the
fundamental limit would require precise control of the energy-level spacing,
independently of the transition dipole moments -- a task that does not appear
possible using today's synthetic approaches. So, we present alternative methods
that can still lead to substantial improvements which only require the control
of the transition moment to the first excited state. While it is best to
normalize measured two photon absorption cross-sections to the fundamental
limits when comparing molecules, we show that simply dividing by the square of
the number of electrons per molecule yields a good metric for comparison.

protect information-carrying quantum states against undesired interactions with
the environment. In past years, many good quantum error-correcting codes had
been derived as binary stabilizer codes. Fault-tolerant quantum computation
prompted the study of nonbinary quantum codes, but the theory of such codes is
not as advanced as that of binary quantum codes. This paper describes the basic
theory of stabilizer codes over finite fields. The relation between stabilizer
codes and general quantum codes is clarified by introducing a Galois theory for
these objects. A characterization of nonbinary stabilizer codes over GF(q) in
terms of classical codes over GF(q^2) is provided that generalizes the
well-known notion of additive codes over GF(4) of the binary case. This paper
derives lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance of stabilizer codes,
gives several code constructions, and derives numerous families of stabilizer
codes, including quantum Hamming codes, quadratic residue codes, quantum Melas
codes, quantum BCH codes, and quantum character codes. The puncturing theory by
Rains is generalized to additive codes that are not necessarily pure. Bounds on
the maximal length of maximum distance separable stabilizer codes are given. A
discussion of open problems concludes this paper.
