0.4<z<1.0 from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey and Canada-France Redshift Survey.
Deep K and z' band photometry allowed us to measure stellar masses for 69
galaxies. From a subsample of 56 galaxies, for which metallicity of the
interstellar medium is also measured, we identified a strong correlation
between mass and metallicity, for the first time in the distant Universe. This
was possible because of the larger base line spanned by the sample in terms of
metallicity (a factor of 7) and mass (a factor of 400) than in previous works.
This correlation is much stronger and tighter than the luminosity-metallicity,
confirming that stellar mass is a more meaningful physical parameter than
luminosity. We find clear evidence for temporal evolution in the M-Z relation
in the sense that at a given mass, a galaxy at z=0.7 tends to have lower
metallicity than a local galaxy of similar mass. We use the z=0.1 SDSS M-Z
relation, and a small sample of z=2.3 Lyman break galaxies with known mass and
metallicity, to propose an empirical redshift-dependent M-Z relation, according
to which the stellar mass and metallicity in small galaxies evolve for a longer
time than in massive galaxies. This relation predicts that the generally metal
poor damped Lyman-alpha galaxies have stellar masses of the order of 10^8.8
M_sun (with a dispersion of 0.7 dex) all the way from z=0.2 to z=4. The
observed redshift evolution of the M-Z relation can be reproduced remarkably
well by a simple closed-box model where the key assumption is an e-folding time
for star formation which is higher or, in other words, a period of star
formation that lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massive
galaxies. Such a picture supports the downsizing scenario for galaxy formation.

is explicitly photon-conserving, so the depletion of ionizing photons by
bound-free opacity is guaranteed to equal the photoionizations these photons
caused. As a result, grid cells can be large and very optically-thick without
loss of accuracy. The method also uses an analytical relaxation solution for
the ionization rate equations for each time step which can accommodate time
steps which greatly exceed the characteristic ionization and ionization front
crossing times. Together, these features make it possible to integrate the
equation of transfer along a ray with many fewer cells and time steps than
previous methods. For multi-dimensional calculations, the code utilizes
short-characteristics ray tracing. C^2-Ray is well-suited for coupling
radiative transfer to gas and N-body dynamics methods, on both fixed and
adaptive grids, without imposing additional limitations on the time step and
grid spacing. We present several tests of the code involving propagation of

transport, have not been ruled out, we focus on the physical implications of

the X-ray irradiated dense molecular tori or XDRs close to the active nuclei.
Our HCN/CO and HCN/HCO$^+$ diagrams will provide a new powerful diagnostic of
the nuclear power source in active galaxies. Based on our diagnostic, we
observe 3 of 5 type-1 Seyferts (6 of 10 in total) host compact nuclear
starbursts. Our results are also supported by observations at other wavelengths

differential rotation rate, which appear to be significantly different from
those for individual sunspots. This implies that the active longitudes are not
linked to the depth of sunspot anchoring. In order to quantify the observed

When using single-mode interferometers, both observables have to be redefined

overestimate the SNR by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. We infer that in any cases,

outflow, energy injection) to accommodate the optical light-curve breaks
observed in 10 GRB afterglows (980519, 990123, 990510, 991216, 000301c, 000926,
010222, 011211, 020813, and 030226), and the relative intensities of the radio,
optical, and X-ray emissions of these afterglows. We find that the jet and
structured outflow models fare much better than the energy injection model in
accommodating the multiwavelength data of the above 10 afterglows. For the
first two models, a uniform circumburst medium provides a better fit to the
optical light-curve break than a wind-like medium with a r^{-2} stratification.
However, in the only two cases where the energy injection model may be at work,
a wind medium is favoured (an energy injection is also possible in a third
case, the afterglow 970508, whose optical emission exhibited a sharp rise but
not a steepening decay). The best fit parameters obtained with the jet model
indicate an outflow energy of 2-6 E50 ergs and a jet opening of 2-3 degrees.
Structured outflows with a quasi-uniform core have a core angular size of
0.7-1.0 degrees and an energy per solid angle of 0.5-3 E53 erg/sr, surrounded
by an envelope where this energy falls-off roughly as theta^{-2} with angle
from the outflow axis, requiring thus the same energy budget as jets.
Circumburst densities are found to be typically in the range 0.1-1 per cc, for
either model. We also find that the reverse shock emission resulting from the
injection of ejecta into the decelerating blast wave at about 1 day after the
burst can explain the slowly decaying radio light-curves observed for the
afterglows 990123, 991216, and 010222.

binaries or higher order multiples. Similarly a sizable fraction have giant
planets. In contrast to these, the situation for brown dwarf companions is
complicated: While close systems seem to be extremely rare, wide systems are
possibly more common. In this paper, we present new results on a survey for
low-mass companions in the Hyades. After measuring precisely the radial
velocity of 98 Hyades dwarf stars for 5 years, we have selected all stars that
show low-amplitude long-period trends. With AO-observations of these 14 stars
we found companion candidates around nine of them, where one star has two
companions. The two companions of HIP 16548 have masses between 0.07 to 0.08
Mo, and are thus either brown dwarfs or very low mass stars. In the case of HAN
172 we found a companion with a mass between 0.08 to 0.10 Mo, which is again
between a star and a brown dwarf. The other seven stars all have stellar
companions. In two additional cases, the RV-variations are presumably caused by
stellar activity, and in another case the companion could be a short-period
binary. The images of the remaining two stars are slightly elongated, which
might imply that even these are binaries. Because at least 12 of the 14 stars
showing low-amplitude RV trends turn out to have companions with a mass greater
than 70 MJupiter, or are just active, we finally estimate the number of
companions with masses between 10 MJupiter and 70 MJupiter within 8 AU of the
host stars in the Hyades as less equal 2%.

information on the largest cluster improves significantly the prediction
accuracy, in particular by allowing to identify those realizations which have
anomalously low or large clusters (cracks). We quantify the prediction gains
using two measures, the relative specific information gain (which is the
variation of entropy obtained by adding new information) and the
root-mean-square of the prediction errors over a large ensemble of
realizations. The bulk of our simulations have been obtained with the
two-dimensional site percolation model on a lattice of size $L \times L=20
\times 20$ and hold true for other lattice sizes. For the hierarchical fiber
bundle model, conditioning the measures of damage on the information of the
location and size of the largest crack extends significantly the critical
region and the prediction skills. These examples illustrate how on-going damage
can be used as a revelation of both the realization-dependent pre-existing
heterogeneity and the damage scenario undertaken by each specific sample.

critical temperature is a well-known effect. It has recently become clear that
phase-slip by quantum tunnelling through the energy barrier can also have a
significant rate at low temperatures. In this paper it is suggested that
quantum phase-slip can be used to realize a superconducting quantum bit without
Josephson junctions. A loop containing a nanofabricated very thin wire is
biased with an externally applied magnetic flux of half a flux quantum,
resulting in two states with opposite circulating current and equal energy.
Quantum phase-slip should provide coherent coupling between these two
macroscopic states. Numbers are given for a wire of amorphous niobium-silicon
that can be fabricated with advanced electron beam lithography.

that photocharging may be the electric face of the structural damage produced
at the surface by photodesorption or laser sputtering. We find the emerging
picture well consistent and elaborate photocharging mechanisms based on
familiar photodesorption steps. The first mechanism based on negative-U
operates in the visible and near infrared. It involves photoelectron capture by
negative-U metal sites at surface dangling bonds and photohole capture by
negative-U sites at active bonds. Dihole formation leading to bond breaking is
the likely prerequisite of metal ion desorption. Alternatively, unihole capture
at trapped electron sites can give rise to self-trapped excitons (STE) which
decay leading to surface defects formation, the prerequisite of metalloid ion
desorption. As a result of the coupling to normally polarized modes, surface
metal or metalloid ions are desorbed while complementary ionic charges appear
in the subsurface region. Alternative photoelectrification mechanisms, such as
the photostimulated migration or reorientation of surface molecule ions
operating in the far infrared are also discussed. Implications for the

given probability distribution over a finite number of items. Campbell
generalized the Huffman problem to a family of problems in which the goal is to
minimize not mean codeword length but rather a generalized mean known as a
quasiarithmetic or quasilinear mean. Such generalized means have a number of
diverse applications, including applications in queueing. Several
quasiarithmetic-mean problems have novel simple redundancy bounds in terms of a
generalized entropy. A related property involves the existence of optimal
codes: For ``well-behaved'' cost functions, optimal codes always exist for
(possibly infinite-alphabet) sources having finite generalized entropy. Solving
finite instances of such problems is done by generalizing an algorithm for
finding length-limited binary codes to a new algorithm for finding optimal
binary codes for any quasiarithmetic mean with a convex cost function. This
algorithm can be performed using quadratic time and linear space, and can be
extended to other penalty functions, some of which are solvable with similar
space and time complexity, and others of which are solvable with slightly
greater complexity. This reduces the computational complexity of a problem
involving minimum delay in a queue, allows combinations of previously
considered problems to be optimized, and greatly expands the space of problems
solvable in quadratic time and linear space. The algorithm can be extended for
purposes such as breaking ties among possibly different optimal codes, as with
bottom-merge Huffman coding.

gaugino mass m_{1/2} in the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with universal scalar
masses m_0 and neutralino dark matter. The NUHM and GDM models with larger m_0
may have large branching ratios for Higgs and/or $Z$ production in the cascade
decays of heavier sparticles, whose detection we discuss. The phenomenology of
the GDM models depends on the nature of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric
particle (NLSP), which has a lifetime exceeding 10^4 seconds in the proposed
benchmark scenarios. In one GDM scenario the NLSP is the lightest neutralino
\chi, and the supersymmetric collider signatures are similar to those in
previous CMSSM benchmarks, but with a distinctive spectrum. In the other GDM
scenarios based on minimal supergravity (mSUGRA), the NLSP is the lighter stau
slepton {\tilde \tau}_1, with a lifetime between ~ 10^4 and 3 X 10^6 seconds.
Every supersymmetric cascade would end in a {\tilde \tau}_1, which would have a
distinctive time-of-flight signature. Slow-moving {\tilde \tau}_1's might be
trapped in a collider detector or outside it, and the preferred detection
strategy would depend on the {\tilde \tau}_1 lifetime. We discuss the extent to
which these mSUGRA GDM scenarios could be distinguished from gauge-mediated
models.

state with the quantum numbers of a baryon combined with an additional light
quark and a heavy antiquark) must exist as a particle stable under strong
interactions in the combined heavy quark and large Nc limits of QCD. Moreover,
in the combined limit these heavy pentaquark states fill multiplets of
SU(4)xO(8)xSU(2). We explore the question of whether corrections in the
combined 1/Nc and 1/mQ expansions are sufficiently small to maintain this
qualitative result. Since no model-independent way is known to answer this
question, we use a class of ``realistic'' hadronic models in which a pentaquark
can be formed via nucleon-heavy meson binding through a pion-exchange
potential. These models have the virtue that they necessarily yield the correct
behavior in the combined limit, and the long-distance parts of the interactions
are model independent. If the long-distance attraction in these models were to
predict bound states in a robust way (i.e., largely insensitive to the details
of the short-range interaction), then one could safely conclude that heavy
pentaquarks do exist. However, in practice the binding does depend very
strongly on the details of the short-distance physics, suggesting that the real
world is not sufficiently near the combined large Nc, mQ limit to use it as a
reliable guide. Whether stable heavy pentaquarks exist remains an open
question.

studied first in a model where the nucleon has an outer cloud and an inner
core. Elastic scattering is viewed as due to two processes: a) diffraction
scattering originating from cloud-cloud interaction; b) a hard or large |t|
scattering originating from one nucleon core scattering off the other via
vector meson omega exchange, while their outer clouds interact independently.
The omega-exchange amplitude shows that omega behaves like an elementary vector
meson at high energy, contrary to a regge pole behavior. This behavior,
however, can be understood in the nonlinear sigma-model where omega couples to
a topological baryonic current like a gauge boson, and the nucleon is described
as a topological soliton. Further investigation shows that the underlying
effective field theory model is a gauged linear sigma-model that has not only
the pion sector and the Wess-Zumino-Witten action of the nonlinear sigma-model,
but also a quark-scalar sector. The nucleon structure that emerges is that the
nucleon has an outer cloud of quark-antiquark condensed ground state, an inner
core of topological baryonic charge probed by omega, and a still smaller
quark-bag containing massless valence quarks. Large |t| pp elastic scattering
is attributed to valence quark-quark elastic scattering, which is taken to be
due to the hard pomeron. The model is applied to predict pp elastic
differential cross section at LHC at c.m. energy 14 TeV and |t| = 0 - 10 GeV*2.
If our predicted differential cross section is quantitatively confirmed by
precise measurement at LHC by the TOTEM group, then it will indicate that
various novel ideas developed over the last four decades to describe the
nucleon combine and lead to a unique physical description of its structure.

The Super-Kamiokande limit on the DSNB electron {\it antineutrino} flux,
$\phi(E_\nu > 19.3 {\rm MeV}) < 1.2$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is just above the
range of recent theoretical predictions based on the measured star formation
rate history. We show that the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory should be able to
test the corresponding DSNB electron {\it neutrino} flux with a sensitivity as
low as $\phi(22.5 < E_\nu < 32.5 {\rm MeV}) \simeq 6 $ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$,
improving the existing Mont Blanc limit by about three orders of magnitude.
While conventional supernova models predict comparable electron neutrino and
antineutrino fluxes, it is often considered that the first (and
forward-directed) SN 1987A event in the Kamiokande-II detector should be
attributed to electron-neutrino scattering with an electron, which would
require a substantially enhanced electron neutrino flux. We show that with the
required enhancements in either the burst or thermal phase $\nu_e$ fluxes, the
DSNB electron neutrino flux would generally be detectable in the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory. A direct experimental test could then resolve one of the
enduring mysteries of SN 1987A: whether the first Kamiokande-II event reveals a
serious misunderstanding of supernova physics, or was simply an unlikely
statistical fluctuation. Thus the electron neutrino sensitivity of the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory is an important complement to the electron antineutrino
sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande in the quest to understand the DSNB.

consistently truncate the superstring equations of motion to the so-called

in this sector are described by two complex fermionic degrees of freedom and we
obtain the corresponding Lagrangian. Remarkably, this Lagrangian can be cast in
a two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant form. The kinetic part of the Lagrangian
induces a non-trivial Poisson structure while the Hamiltonian is just the one
of the massive Dirac fermion. We find a change of variables which brings the
Poisson structure to the canonical form but makes the Hamiltonian nontrivial.
The Hamiltonian is derived as an exact function of two parameters: the total
S^5 angular momentum J and string tension \lambda; it is a polynomial in 1/J
and in \sqrt{\lambda'} where \lambda'=\frac{\lambda}{J^2} is the effective BMN
coupling. We identify the string states dual to the gauge theory operators from
the closed su(1|1) sector of N=4 SYM and show that the corresponding near-plane
wave energy shift computed from our Hamiltonian perfectly agrees with that
recently found in the literature. Finally we show that the Hamiltonian is
integrable by explicitly constructing the corresponding Lax representation.

  Pardo et al, eds.) Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 36-105",,,"math.NA cs.CC",,"  Given a multivariate real (or complex) polynomial $p$ and a domain $\cal D$,
we would like to decide whether an algorithm exists to evaluate $p(x)$
accurately for all $x \in {\cal D}$ using rounded real (or complex) arithmetic.
Here ``accurately'' means with relative error less than 1, i.e., with some
correct leading digits. The answer depends on the model of rounded arithmetic:
We assume that for any arithmetic operator $op(a,b)$, for example $a+b$ or $a
\cdot b$, its computed value is $op(a,b) \cdot (1 + \delta)$, where $| \delta
|$ is bounded by some constant $\epsilon$ where $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$, but
$\delta$ is otherwise arbitrary. This model is the traditional one used to
analyze the accuracy of floating point algorithms.Our ultimate goal is to
establish a decision procedure that, for any $p$ and $\cal D$, either exhibits
an accurate algorithm or proves that none exists. In contrast to the case where
numbers are stored and manipulated as finite bit strings (e.g., as floating
point numbers or rational numbers) we show that some polynomials $p$ are
impossible to evaluate accurately. The existence of an accurate algorithm will
depend not just on $p$ and $\cal D$, but on which arithmetic operators and
which constants are are available and whether branching is permitted. Toward
this goal, we present necessary conditions on $p$ for it to be accurately
evaluable on open real or complex domains ${\cal D}$. We also give sufficient
conditions, and describe progress toward a complete decision procedure. We do
present a complete decision procedure for homogeneous polynomials $p$ with

action, as opposed to the discrete Lagrangian, is the fundamental object. This
is achieved by approximating the action integral with appropriate choices of a
finite-dimensional function space that approximate sections of the
configuration bundle and numerical quadrature to approximate the integral. We
discuss how this general framework allows us to recover higher-order Galerkin
variational integrators, asynchronous variational integrators, and
symplectic-energy-momentum integrators. In addition, we will consider function
spaces that are not parameterized by field values evaluated at nodal points,
which allows the construction of Lie group, multiscale, and pseudospectral
variational integrators. The construction of pseudospectral variational
integrators is illustrated by applying it to the (linear) Schrodinger equation.
G-invariant discrete Lagrangians are constructed in the context of Lie group
methods through the use of natural charts and interpolation at the level of the
Lie algebra. The reduction of these G-invariant Lagrangians yield a
higher-order analogue of discrete Euler-Poincare reduction. By considering
nonlinear approximation spaces, spatio-temporally adaptive variational
integrators can be introduced as well.

is approximately separable into a product of a function $A_k(k)$ and a function
$A_l(l)$, where $k$ is the number of citations already received (in-degree) and
$l$ is the age measured in patent number units. $A_l(l)$ displays a peak at low
$l$ and a long power law tail, suggesting that some patented technologies have
very long-term effects. $A_k(k)$ exhibits super-linear preferential attachment.
The preferential attachment exponent has been increasing since 1991, suggesting
that patent citations are increasingly concentrated on a relatively small
number of patents. The overall average probability that a new patent will be
cited by a given patent has increased slightly during the same period. We

background noise, is proposed which does not need net energy transfer in the
information channel. The communicator devices do dissipate energy; however,
they do not emit net energy into the channel, instead of that, they modulate
the parameters of inherent spontaneous fluctuations in the channel. The method
can use two different mechanisms, thermal noise (Johnson-Nyquist noise) for
classical communication, and vacuum fluctuations/zero point energy (quantum
uncertainty noise) for quantum communication. The strongest advantage of the
method that this is apparently the most hidden (stealth) way of communication,
because it is using the inherent background noise for communication, therefore
it is extremely difficult or impossible to discover its presence. With proper
wave-based arrangements and specific conditions, the sender and the receiver
can easily detect eavesdropper activities, so that the eavesdropper is detected
as soon as she extracts a single bit of information, thus the security of the
method is comparable to the security of quantum communication/quantum key
distribution schemes. Finally, concerning practical applications, environmental

characteristics and internal structural velocities of galaxies have suggested
the presence of massive central black holes. In the present work, we examine
whether conditions existed in the early universe, that could have led to the
formation of gravitational structures possessing such unusual characteristics.
We propose an early-time pressure-fluctuation model, which would have generated
a radiation based energy distribution possessing the characteristic of a
centrally collapsed zone isolated from its surrounding environment and thereby
manifesting such a black hole behavior. Einstein's gravitational equations are
assumed to apply within the radiation-dominated hole-core spatial domain and,
with utilization of a spherically symmetric isotropic metric, are used in order
to calculate the evolutionary time expansion characteristics. Birth times for
the radiation structures are uniquely correlated with the size of the spheres
and are primarily determined from the early time energy densities and the
apparent curvatures presented by the gravitational equations. The model
displays an early time pressure fluctuation collapse, tentatively interpreted
to be the formation of a galaxy hole, and therein provides a theoretical basis
for the experimental data.

system our Solar System was modified in such a way that we replaced the Earth
by a more massive planet and let the other planets and all the orbital elements
unchanged. The major result of former numerical experiments with a modified
Solar System was the appearance of a chaotic window at $\kappa_E \in (4,6)$,
where the dynamical state of the system was highly chaotic and even the body
with the smallest mass escaped in some cases. On the contrary for very large
values of the mass of the Earth, even greater than that of Jupiter regular
dynamical behaviour was observed. In this paper the investigations are extended
to the complete Solar System and showed, that this chaotic window does still
exist. Tests in different 'Solar Systems' clarified that including only Jupiter
and Saturn with their actual masses together with a more 'massive' Earth ($4 <
\kappa_E < 6$) perturbs the orbit of Mars so that it can even be ejected from
the system. Using the results of the Laplace-Lagrange secular theory we found
secular resonances acting between the motions of the nodes of Mars, Jupiter and
Saturn. These secular resonances give rise to strong chaos, which is the cause
of the appearance of the instability window.

be corrected using control codes. In classical test and verification one
develops a test set separating a correct circuit from a circuit containing any
considered fault. Classical faults are modelled at the logical level by fault
models that act on classical states. The stuck fault model, thought of as a
lead connected to a power rail or to a ground, is most typically considered. A
classical test set complete for the stuck fault model propagates both binary
basis states, 0 and 1, through all nodes in a network and is known to detect
many physical faults. A classical test set complete for the stuck fault model
allows all circuit nodes to be completely tested and verifies the function of
many gates. It is natural to ask if one may adapt any of the known classical
methods to test quantum circuits. Of course, classical fault models do not
capture all the logical failures found in quantum circuits. The first obstacle
faced when using methods from classical test is developing a set of realistic
quantum-logical fault models. Developing fault models to abstract the test
problem away from the device level motivated our study. Several results are
established. First, we describe typical modes of failure present in the
physical design of quantum circuits. From this we develop fault models for
quantum binary circuits that enable testing at the logical level. The
application of these fault models is shown by adapting the classical test set
generation technique known as constructing a fault table to generate quantum
test sets. A test set developed using this method is shown to detect each of
the considered faults.
