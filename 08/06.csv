increase in external pressure. We compare isothermal models to models including
cooling with a simple but self-consistent treatment of the coupling between
gas, grains and radiation field temperatures. The hydrostatic equilibrium
appears to hold past the marginally stable state, until the collapse proceeds.
The last hydrostatic state before collapse has a lower central gas temperature
in the centre due to the enhanced coupling between gas, grains and radiation
field. This results in slightly lower pressure gradients in the bulk of the
envelope which is hence slightly more extended than in the isothermal case. Due
to the sensitivity of the collapse on these initial conditions, protostellar
infall velocities in the envelope turn out to be much slower in the case with
cooling.Our models also compute the radiative transfer and a rather large
chemical network coupled to gas dynamics. However, we note that the
steady-state chemisorption of CO is sufficient to provide an accurate cooling
function of the gas. This justifies the use of post-processing techniques to
account for the abundance of observed molecules. Existing observations of
infall signatures put very stringent constraints on the kinematics and
temperature profile of the class 0 protostar IRAM 04191+1522. We show that
isothermal models fail to account for the innermost slow infall motions
observed, even with the most hydrostatic initial conditions. In contrast,
models with cooling reproduce the general shape of the temperature profile
inferred from observations and are in much better agreement with the infall
signatures in the inner 3000 AU.

Earth masses. Three sources were detected in the survey, one of which (HD
107146) has been previously reported. One of the other two submillimeter
sources, HD 104860, was not detected by IRAS and is surrounded by a cold,
massive dust disk with a dust temperature and mass of Tdust = 33 K and Mdust =
0.16 Mearth. The third source, HD 8907, was detected by IRAS and ISO at 60-87
microns, and has a dust temperature and mass Tdust = 48 K and Mdust = 0.036
Mearth. We find that the deduced masses and radii of the dust disks in our
sample are roughly consistent with models for the collisional evolution of
planetesimal disks with embedded planets. We also searched for residual gas in
two of the three systems with detected submillimeter excesses and place limits
on the mass of gas residing in these systems.
  When the properties measured for the detected excess sources are combined
with the larger population of submillimeter excess sources from the literature,
we find strong evidence that the mass in small grains declines significantly on
a ~200 Myr timescale, approximately inversely with age. However, we also find
that the characteristic dust radii of the population, obtained from the dust
temperature of the excess and assuming blackbody grains, is uncorrelated with
age. This is in contrast to self-stirred collisional models for debris disk
evolution which predict a trend of radius increasing with age, t ~ R^3. The
lack of agreement suggests that processes beyond self-stirring, such as giant
planet formation, play a role in the evolutionary histories of planetesimal
disks.

detail and derive explicit criteria for the particle number required to

illustrate them with numerical experiments. To do this, we perform direct
numerical solution of perturbation theory and make detailed comparisons with
N-body simulations. The criteria include: sufficient particle coverage in phase
space near the resonance and enough particles to minimize gravitational
potential fluctuations that will change the dynamics of the resonant encounter.
Some of our more surprising findings are as follows. First, the
Inner-Lindblad-like resonance (ILR), responsible for coupling the bar to the
central halo cusp, requires almost 10^9 equal mass particles within the virial
radius for a Milky-Way-like bar in an NFW profile. Second, orbits that linger
near the resonance receive more angular momentum than orbits that move through
the resonance quickly. Small-scale fluctuations present in state-of-the-art
particle-particle simulations can knock orbits out of resonance, preventing
them from lingering and, thereby, decrease the torque. The required particle
numbers are sufficiently high for scenarios of interest that apparent
convergence in particle number is misleading: the convergence is in the
noise-dominated regime. State-of-the-art simulations are not adequate to follow
all aspects of secular evolution driven by the bar-halo interaction. We present
a procedure to test the requirements for individual N-body codes for the actual
problem of interest. [abridged]

de-convolve the observed quasar luminosity function at various redshifts to
determine the rate of formation of black holes of a given final mass.
Identifying quasar activity with the formation of spheroids in the framework of
the merger hypothesis, this enables us to deduce the corresponding rate of
formation of spheroids with given properties as a function of redshift. This
allows us to predict, for the red galaxy population, the distribution of galaxy
velocity dispersions, the mass function, mass density, star formation rates,
the luminosity function in many observed wavebands (NUV, U, B, V, R, I, J, H,
K), the total red galaxy number density and luminosity density, the
distribution of colors as a function of magnitude and velocity dispersion for
several different wavebands, the distribution of mass to light ratios vs. mass,
the luminosity-size relations, and the typical ages and distribution of ages
(formation redshifts) as a function of both mass and luminosity. For each of
these quantities, we predict the evolution from redshift z=0-6. Each of our
predictions agrees well with existing observations, without the addition of
tunable parameters; the essential observational inputs come from the observed
quasar luminosity function. These predictions are skewed by several orders of
magnitude if we adopt simpler, traditional models of quasar lifetimes in which
quasars turn on/off or follow simple exponential light curves, instead of the
more complicated evolution implied by our simulations.

field of a rotating, axisymmetric neutron star due to the accretion of plasma
from a disk. The decrease of the field occurs due to the electric current in
the infalling plasma. The deposition of this current carrying plasma on the
star's surface creates an induced magnetic moment with a sign opposite to that
of the original magnetic dipole. The field decreases independent of whether the
star spins-up or spins-down. The time-scale for an appreciable decrease (factor
of $>100$) of the field is found to be $\sim 1.6 \times 10^7$ yr, for a mass
accretion rate $\dot{M}=10^{-9} M_\odot/$yr and an initial magnetic moment
$\mu_i = 10^{30}{\rm G cm}^3$ which corresponds to a surface field of $10^{12}

$\mu_i^{3.8}/\dot{M}^{1.9}$. The decrease of the magnetic field does not have a

out on an Ohmic diffusion time scale which is estimated to be $ > 10^9$ yr.

measurement of the evolution of the ionization fraction in the universe, and

integral role in the translation of genetic information from DNA to cellular
function. Quantitative experimental studies of these biological systems have
led to a renewed interest in the polymer mechanics relevant for describing the
conformational free energy of DNA bending induced by protein-DNA complexes.
Recent experimental results from DNA cyclization studies have cast doubt on the
applicability of the canonical semiflexible polymer theory, the wormlike chain
(WLC) model, to DNA bending on biological length scales. This paper develops a
theory of the chain statistics of a class of generalized semiflexible polymer
models. Our focus is on the theoretical development of these models and the
calculation of experimental observables. To illustrate our methods, we focus on
a specific toy model of DNA bending. We show that the WLC model generically
describes the long-length-scale chain statistics of semiflexible polymers, as
predicted by the Renormalization Group. In particular, we show that either the
WLC or our new model adequate describes force-extension, solution scattering,
and long-contour-length cyclization experiments, regardless of the details of
DNA bend elasticity. In contrast, experiments sensitive to short-length-scale
chain behavior can in principle reveal dramatic departures from the linear
elastic behavior assumed in the WLC model. We demonstrate this explicitly by
showing that our toy model can reproduce the anomalously large
short-contour-length cyclization J factors observed by Cloutier and Widom.
Finally, we discuss the applicability of these models to DNA chain statistics
in the context of future experiments.

by an external stress during the transformation of a continuum inclusion (Proc.

volume that is obtained via atomistic calculations under various boundary
conditions. It also yields the correction term for formation volume calculated
under these boundary conditions. Using two types of boundary conditions
commonly employed in atomistic calculations, a comparison is also made of the

plastic scintillator targets, extending our previous work on beryllium and
silicon targets. The scintillator experiment posed several additional
experimental challenges associated with charging of the scintillator target,
and those challenges are addressed in detail. In addition, we quantitatively
compare the energy and angular distributions of this data, and our previous
data, with electron transport simulations based on the Geant4 and Penelope
Monte Carlo simulation codes. The Penelope simulation is found globally to give
a superior description of the data. Such information is crucial for a broad
array of weak-interaction physics experiments, where electron backscattering
can give rise to the dominant detector-related systematic uncertainty.

subject to time dependent noise in the qubit energy splitting. We show with
explicit numerical results that high fidelity bit flips and one-qubit NOT gates
may be generated by imposing bounded control fields. For noise correlation
times shorter than the time for a pi-pulse, the time optimal pi-pulse yields
the highest fidelity. For very long correlation times, fidelity loss is
approximately due to systematic error, which is efficiently tackled by
compensation for off-resonance with a pulse sequence (CORPSE). For intermediate
ranges of the noise correlation time we find that short CORPSE, which is less
accurate than CORPSE in correcting systematic errors, yields higher fidelities.
Numerical optimization of the pulse sequences using gradient ascent pulse
engineering results in noticeable improvement of the fidelities for the bit
flip and marginal improvement for the NOT gate.
