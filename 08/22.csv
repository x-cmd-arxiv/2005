the present study is to investigate the capability of the Pierre Auger

According to the detector response to photon showers around one GeV, and making

Pierre Auger Observatory is a competitive instrument for this technique, and
that water tanks are very promising detectors for the single particle

a luminosity of 4.11e42 ergs/s. This upper-limit on the HeII 1640 luminosity

We show that the observed ignition conditions exclude fast neutrino emission in

sites of star formation. The data span 16 years of observations and allow to
draw conclusions about the maser detection rate in this class of objects. In
spite of the relatively high far-infrared luminosities of the embedded sources
($L_{\rm FIR}\ga 10^2$ L$_\odot$), H$_2$O maser emission was detected towards
three globules only. Since the occurrence of water masers is higher towards
bright IRAS sources, the lack of frequent H$_2$O maser emission is somewhat
surprising if the suggestion of induced intermediate- and high-mass star
formation within these globules is correct. The maser properties of two BRCs
are characteristic of exciting sources of low-mass, while the last one (BRC~38)
is consistent with an intermediate-mass object. We argue that most BRCs host
young stellar objects of low-luminosity, likely in an evolutionary phase later
than the protostellar Class 0 sources, and that a significant contribution to
the observd IRAS luminosity comes from warm dust heated by the radiation from

reaching Planck density dynamics one expects major modifications from the
de-coherent thermal equations of state, suggesting a prior phase that has
macroscopic coherence properties. The assumption that the phase transition
occurs during the radiation dominated epoch, and that zero-point motions drive
the fluctuations associated with this transition, specifies a class of
cosmological models in which the cosmic microwave background fluctuation
amplitude at last scattering is approximately $10^{-5}$. Quantum measurability
constraints (eg. uncertainly relations) define cosmological scales whose
expansion rates can be at most luminal. Examination of these constraints for
the observed dark energy density establishes a time interval from the
transition to the present. It is shown that the dark energy can consistently be
interpreted as due to the vacuum energy of collective gravitational modes which
manifest as the zero-point motions of coherent Planck scale mass units prior to
the gravitational quantum de-coherence of the cosmology. A scenario is
suggested that connects microscopic physics to the relevant cosmological scale.

carried out with BeppoSAX in order to compare the X-ray spectral and timing
characteristics observed by this satellite over the broadest range of energies
ever (1.5-100 keV) with the information previously obtained with other
spacecraft. The light curve of 4U 0114+65 shows a large flare at the beginning
of the BeppoSAX pointing and no significant hardness evolution either during
the flare or in the low state occurring after the flare itself. The modulation
at about 2.7 hours, attributed to the accreting neutron star (NS) spin
periodicity, is not significantly detected in our data, although fluctuations
with timescales of about 3 hours can be seen in the 2-10 keV light curve.
Shorter modulations down to timescales of minutes, are also found and
interpreted as due to accretion of matter onto the NS. The flaring and the low
state spectra of 4U 0114+65 can be equally well fitted either with a power law
modulated by a high-energy exponential cutoff or with a Comptonization model.
During the low state the presence, although tentative, of a thermal component
(with kT around 0.3 keV) at low energies, possibly produced by an ionized
plasma cloud around the NS, cannot be excluded. Contrary to previous claims, a
cyclotron resonant feature in absorption at about 22 keV was not detected in
the BeppoSAX spectroscopic data, whereas evidence for a Fe emission line around
6.4 keV is found only during the low state emission. Using all of the above
information, a scenario for the system in which the NS is embedded in, and
accreting from, a low angular momentum gas cloud is envisaged.

sub-Keplerian gas and lose angular momentum, forcing them to migrate towards
the central star and settle to the midplane. The gas drag efficiency varies
according to the grain size, with the larger bodies being weakly influenced and
following marginally perturbed Keplerian orbits, while smaller grains are
strongly coupled to the gas. For intermediate sized grains, the drag force
decouples the dust and gas, allowing the dust to preferentially migrate

distributions for each grain size will indicate, when grain growth is added,
the regions when planets are likely to form.

Furthermore, in many sceneries the knowledge is not represented in a crisp way.
It is common to find fuzzy concepts or problems with some level of uncertainty.
There are not many practical systems which handle fuzziness and uncertainty and
the few examples that we can find are used by a minority. To extend a popular
system (which many programmers are using) with the ability of combining crisp
and fuzzy knowledge representations seems to be an interesting issue.
  Our first work (Fuzzy Prolog) was a language that models
$\mathcal{B}([0,1])$-valued Fuzzy Logic. In the Borel algebra,
$\mathcal{B}([0,1])$, truth value is represented using unions of intervals of
real numbers. This work was more general in truth value representation and
propagation than previous works.
  An interpreter for this language using Constraint Logic Programming over Real
numbers (CLP(${\cal R}$)) was implemented and is available in the Ciao system.
  Now, we enhance our former approach by using default knowledge to represent
incomplete information in Logic Programming. We also provide the implementation
of this new framework. This new release of Fuzzy Prolog handles incomplete
information, it has a complete semantics (the previous one was incomplete as
Prolog) and moreover it is able to combine crisp and fuzzy logic in Prolog
programs. Therefore, new Fuzzy Prolog is more expressive to represent real
world.
  Fuzzy Prolog inherited from Prolog its incompleteness. The incorporation of
default reasoning to Fuzzy Prolog removes this problem and requires a richer
semantics which we discuss.

For the multipath channel, it is assumed that channel gains are known, but path
delays are unknown. In the limit of large bandwidth, W, it is assumed that the
number of paths, L, grows. The delay spread of the channel, M, is proportional
to the bandwidth. The rate of growth of L versus M determines whether
synchronization can occur. It is shown that if L/sqrt(M) --> 0, then the
maximum likelihood synchronizer cannot acquire any of the paths and
alternatively if L/M --> 0, the maximum likelihood synchronizer is guaranteed
to miss at least one path.

the Centre for High Energy Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
Chapter 1 is a brief introduction to QCD. In Chapter 2, we formulate QCD in the
large-$N_{c}$ and strong transverse coupling limits, and then exactly integrate
out all the gauge degrees of freedom to obtain the generating functional for
quark-antiquark bilinears. We study the chiral properties of our limiting
theory in Chapter 3, for naive as well as Wilson fermions, and obtain a
recursive relation for the chiral condensate. In Chapter 4, we obtain the
homogeneous integral equation satisfied by the meson states of our theory.
Comparison of this equation with the corresponding one for the 't~Hooft model
allows us to infer many physical meson properties. Our results are consistent
with phenomenological expectations, and this is the first time that such
results have been obtained from $(3+1)$-dim QCD, with only quark and gluon
degrees of freedom and no ad hoc model assumptions. Extraction of precise
values requires numerical solution of the integral equation; we have not yet
carried that out and we describe our outlook for further investigations at the
end of Chapter 4. Three appendices supplement our analysis. Our notation and
conventions are listed in Appendix A. The known results for mesons in the
't~Hooft model and in strong coupling lattice QCD are rederived, in Appendix B
and in Appendix C respectively, using the same methodology as followed in the
thesis. That allows convenient comparison, as well as demonstrates the
advantage of our approach over these two well-studied approximations to QCD.

nonperturbative effective charge it is finite, negative and it has no imaginary

of the mass gap, which is responsible for the large-scale structure of the true
QCD vacuum, or of the effective scale, which separates the nonperturbative
region from the perturbative one. We have also argued that the Bag constant is
a quant of energy density which can be released from the QCD vacuum, which, in

integral to derive the statement that the the sum over random walks of the
thermal scalar near the Hagedorn transition is precisely the image under a
modular transformation of the sum over spatial configurations of a single
highly excited string. We compute the radius of gyration of thermally excited
strings in $AdS_D\times S^n$. We show that the winding mode indicates an
instability despite the AdS curvature at large radius, and that the negative
mass squared decreases with decreasing AdS radius, much like the type 0
tachyon. We add further arguments to statements by Barbon and Rabinovici, and
by Adams {\it et. al.}, that the Euclidean AdS black hole can thought of as a
condensate of the thermal scalar. We use this to provide circumstantial
evidence that the condensation of the thermal scalar decouples closed string

addition, theoretical analysis indicates that earthquake stresses may obey a
wave-like equation, having solutions with inverse frequencies for a given fault
similar to those that characterize the time intervals between the largest
events on the fault. It is therefore desirable to apply complex principal
component analysis to develop earthquake forecast algorithms. In this paper we
modify the Pattern Informatics method of earthquake forecasting to take
advantage of the wave-like properties of seismic stresses and utilize the
Hilbert transform to create complex eigenvectors out of measured time series.
We show that Pattern Informatics analyses using complex eigenvectors create
short-term forecast hot-spot maps that differ from hot-spot maps created using

conclusion, thus suggesting that real markets operate close to a dynamically

that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral genome. Assembly
models are developed for viral capsids built from protein building blocks that
can assume different local bonding structures in the capsid. This situation
occurs, for example, for viruses in the family of Papovaviridae, which are
linked to cancer and are hence of particular interest for the health sector.
More specifically, the viral capsids of the (pseudo-) T=7 particles in this
family consist of pentamers that exhibit two different types of bonding
structures. While this scenario cannot be described mathematically in terms of
Caspar-Klug Theory (Caspar and Klug 1962), it can be modelled via tiling theory
(Twarock 2004). The latter is used to encode the local bonding environment of
the building blocks in a combinatorial structure, called the assembly tree,
which is a basic ingredient in the derivation of assembly models for
Papovaviridae along the lines of the equilibrium approach of Zlotnick (Zlotnick
1994). A phase space formalism is introduced to characterize the changes in the
assembly pathways and intermediates triggered by the variations in the
association energies characterizing the bonds between the building blocks in
the capsid. Furthermore, the assembly pathways and concentrations of the
statistically dominant assembly intermediates are determined. The example of
Simian Virus 40 is discussed in detail.

apparatus A triggers the establishment of correlations, which provide
statistical information about S. Robust registration requires A to be
macroscopic, and a dynamical symmetry breaking of A governed by S allows the
absence of any bias. Phase transitions are thus a paradigm for quantum
measurement apparatuses, with the order parameter as pointer variable. The
coupling $g$ behaves as the source of symmetry breaking. The exact solution of
a model where S is a single spin and A a magnetic dot (consisting of $N$
interacting spins and a phonon thermal bath) exhibits the reduction of the
state as a relaxation process of the off-diagonal elements of S+A, rapid due to
the large size of $N$. The registration of the diagonal elements involves a
slower relaxation from the initial paramagnetic state of A to either one of its
ferromagnetic states. If $g$ is too weak, the measurement fails due to a
``Buridan's ass'' effect. The probability distribution for the magnetization
then develops not one but two narrow peaks at the ferromagnetic values. During
its evolution it goes through wide shapes extending between these values.
