emission at z=6.03 and z=6.04 in the Subaru Deep Field. These two objects are
originally selected as i'-dropouts (i'-z' > 1.5) showing an interesting
photometric property, the ``NB921 depression''. The NB921-band (centered at
9196A) magnitude is significantly depressed with respect to the z'-band
magnitude. The optical spectra of these two objects exhibit asymmetric
emission-lines at lambda_obs ~ 8540A and ~ 8560A, suggesting that these objects
are Ly_alpha emitters at z~6. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Ly_alpha
emission of the two objects are 94A and 236A; the latter one is the Ly_alpha
emitter with the largest Ly_alpha equivalent width at z > 6 ever
spectroscopically confirmed. The spectroscopically measured Ly_alpha fluxes of
these two objects are consistent with the interpretation that the NB921
depression is caused by the contribution of the strong Ly_alpha emission to the
z'-band flux. Most of the NB921-depressed i'-dropout objects are thought to be
strong Ly_alpha emitters at 6.0 < z < 6.5; Galactic L and T dwarfs and
NB921-dropout galaxies at z > 6.6 do not dominate the NB921-depressed
i'-dropout sample. Thus the NB921-depression method is very useful for finding
high-z Ly_alpha emitters with a large Ly_alpha equivalent width over a large
redshift range, 6.0 < z < 6.5. Although the broadband-selected sample at z ~ 3
contains only a small fraction of objects with a Ly_alpha equivalent width
larger than 100A, the i'-dropout sample of the Subaru Deep Field contains a
much larger fraction of such strong Ly_alpha emitters. This may imply a strong
evolution of the Ly_alpha equivalent width from z > 6 to z ~ 3.

galaxy NGC 4365, using new wide-field VIK imaging. The GC colour distribution
has (at least) two peaks, but the colours of the red GCs appear more strongly
weighted towards intermediate colours compared to most other large ellipticals
and the integrated galaxy light. The intermediate-color/red peak may itself be
composed of two sub-populations, with clusters of intermediate colours more
concentrated towards the centre of the galaxy than both the blue and red GCs.
Nearly all intermediate-colour and red GCs in our sample show an offset towards
red V-K and/or blue V-I colours compared to SSP models for old ages in a
(V-K,V-I) diagram. This has in the past been interpreted as evidence for
intermediate ages. We also combine our VIK data with previously published
spectroscopy. The differences between observed and model colour-metallicity
relations are consistent with the offsets observed in the two-colour diagram,
with the metal-rich GCs being too red (by about 0.2 mag) in V-K and too blue
(by about 0.05 mag) in V-I compared to the models at a given metallicity. These
offsets cannot easily be explained as an effect of younger ages. We conclude
that, while intermediate GC ages cannot be definitively ruled out, an
alternative scenario is more likely whereby all the GCs are old but the
relative number of intermediate-metallicity GCs is greater than typical for
giant ellipticals. The main obstacle to reaching a definitive conclusion is the
lack of robust calibrations of integrated spectral and photometric properties
for stellar populations with near-solar metallicity. In any case, it is
puzzling that the intermediate-colour GCs in NGC 4365 are not accompanied by a
corresponding shift of the integrated galaxy light towards bluer colours.

decontamination procedure to infer on the intrinsic CMD morphology which is
critical for such low-contrast objects. Consequently, it became possible to
derive accurate reddening, age, distance from the Sun and Galactocentric
distance for the five clusters. In the structural and luminosity/mass-function
analyses we apply a colour-magnitude filter which encompasses the cluster
evolutionary CMD sequences and excludes stars with discrepant colours. Using
this procedure we derive core and limiting radii, mass function slope, total
mass, mass density and relaxation time. We derive ages in the range 140 -- 1
100 Myr, Galactocentric distances within 7.7 -- 11.4 kpc, and total masses
within 360--2 900 \ms. Reflecting large-scale mass segregation, the MF slope in
the core is significantly flatter than that in the halo of the five clusters.
Although some of the present clusters are relatively younger than the Gyr-old
clusters, they present evidence of advanced dynamical evolution. This kind of
study has become possible because of the photometric uniformity and spatial
coverage of 2MASS which allows a proper subtraction of the field-star
contamination on the target CMDs. The present study indicates that low-contrast

different interpretation for their origin. We find that nearly half of the

information is available, the X-ray sources are found to reside in red

consistent with the one drawn from a population of Low Mass X-ray Binaries. We
further investigate the properties of the sample of point-like sources obtained
from archival optical images that we suggest are good globular cluster

non-homogeneous. In addition, we show that the distributions of the optical and

of SgrA* remains unexplained. One currently popular idea for their origin
posits that the stars were bused in by an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH)
which has inspiraled into the Galactic Center a few million years ago.
  Yu and Tremaine (2003) have argued that in this case some of the old stars in
the SgrA* cusp would be ejected by hard gravitational collisions with the IMBH.
Here we derive a general expression for the phase-space distribution of the
ejected high-velocity stars, given the distribution function of the stars in
the cusp. We compute it explicitly for the Peebles-Young distribution function
of the cusp, and make a detailed model for the time-dependent ejection of stars
during the IMBH inspiral. We find that (1) the stars are ejected in a burst
lasting a few dynamical friction timescales; if the ejected stars are detected
by Gaia they are likely to be produced by a single inspiral event, (2) if the
inspiral is circular than in the beginning of the burst the velocity vectors of
the ejected stars cluster around the inspiral plane, but rapidly isotropise as
the burst proceeds, (3) if the inspiral is eccentric, then the stars are
ejected in a broad jet roughly perpendicular to the Runge-Lenz vector of the
IMBH orbit. In a typical cusp the orbit will precess with a period of \sim 10^5
years, and the rate of ejection into our part of the Galaxy (as defined by e.g.
the Gaia visibility domain) will be modulated periodically. Gaia, together with
the ground-based follow-up observations, will be able to clock many
high-velocity stars back to their ejection from the Galactic Center, thus
measuring some of the above phenomena. This would provide a clear signature of
the IMBH inspiral in the past 10--20 Myr.

that in rapidly rotating harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensates, unlike

phase diagrams of YBa2Cu3O{6+/delta} and La2-xSrxCuO4 is presented. The model
is based on the assumption of rigid localization of doped charges in the close

electronic structure of the parent charge-transfer insulator that depends on
the local mutual arrangement of the doped charges. It is shown that in such
system the negative-U centers (NUCs) may form under certain conditions on the
pairs of neighboring Cu cations in CuO2 plane. We consider the mechanism of
hole generation. The calculated dependences of hole concentration in
YBa2Cu3O{6+/delta} on doping and temperature are found to be in a perfect
quantitative agreement with experimental data. In the framework of the model
the phase diagrams of YBa2Cu3O{6+/delta} is considered and the interpretation
of pseudogap and 60 K-phases in YBa2Cu3O{6+/delta} is offered. The pseudogap
has superconducting nature and arises at temperature T*>Tc/inf>Tc in small
clusters uniting a number of NUCs due to large fluctuations of NUC occupation.
(Tc/inf and Tc are the temperatures of superconducting transition for infinite
and finite clusters, accordingly). The calculated T*(/delta) and Tc(/delta)
dependences are in accordance with experiment. The range between T*(/delta) and
Tc(/delta) corresponds to the range of fluctuations where small clusters
fluctuate between superconducting and normal states owing to fluctuations of
NUC occupation. The phase diagram of La2-xSrxCuO4 is calculated. It is shown
the features of the superconducting phase diagram and the characteristics of
stripe textures of La2-xSrxCuO4 only reflect the geometrical relations existing

that, as the effect of the chemical potential on the effective gluon propagator
is taken into account, the chiral quark condensate decreases gradually with the
increasing of the chemical potential if it is less than the critical value, and
the condensate vanishes suddenly at the critical chemical potential. The
inclusion of the chemical potential in the effective gluon propagator enhances
the decreasing rate and decreases the critical chemical potential. It indicates
that the chiral symmetry can be restored completely at a critical chemical
potential and restored partially as the chemical potential is less than the
critical value. If the effective gluon propagator is independent of the
chemical potential, the chiral symmetry can only be restored suddenly but no
gradual restoration.

for Turing instability may exhibit heterogeneous ""glassy"" steady state, with no
characteristic wavelength, if the diffusion rate associated with the ""slow""
reactant is very small. Upon decreasing the diffusion constant of the slow
reactant three phases are identified: strong diffusion yields a stable
homogenous phase, intermediate diffusion implies Turing (crystal like) patterns
while in the slow diffusion limit the glassy state is the generic stable
solution. In this disordered phase the dynamics is of crucial importance, with
strong differences between local and global initiation.

bunching at fundamental frequency is an important option in the operation of
high gain Free-Electron Lasers (FELs). The use of harmonic generation at a
large scale facility may result in achieving shorter radiation wavelengths for
the same electron beam energy. This paper describes a theory of second harmonic
generation in planar undulators with particular attention to X-Ray FELs
(XFELs). Our study is based on an exact analytical solution of Maxwell
equations, derived with the help of the Green's function method. On the
contrary, up-to-date theoretical understanding of the second harmonic
generation is only limited to some estimation of the total radiation power
based on the source part of the wave equation. Moreover, we find that such part
of the wave equation is presented with several incorrect manipulations among
which is the omission of an important contribution. Our work yields correct
parametric dependencies and specific predictions of additional properties such
as polarization, angular distribution of the radiation intensity and total
power. The most surprising prediction is the presence of a vertically polarized
part of the second harmonic radiation, whereas up-to-date understanding assumes
that the field is horizontally polarized. Altogether, this paper presents the
first correct theory of second harmonic generation for high gain FELs.

investigated. Specifically, the entropy behavior in the low temperature limit,

behavior of the relaxation frequency in the $T\to0$ limit does not play a
physical role since the anomalous skin effect dominates in this range. In
contrast with the previous works, where the approximate Leontovich impedance
was used for analysis of nonlocal effects, we give description of the problem
in terms of exact nonlocal impedances. It is found that the Casimir entropy is
going to zero at $T\to0$ only in the case when $s$ polarization does not
contribute to the classical part of the Casimir force. However, the entropy
approaching zero from the negative side that, in our opinion, cannot be
