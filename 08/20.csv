measurements made with a constellation of laser beacons. Here we report the
first such measurements, made at the 6.5 m MMT with five Rayleigh beacons in a
2 arcmin pentagon. Each beacon is made with a pulsed beam at 532 nm, of 4 W at
the exit pupil of the projector. The return is range-gated from 20-29 km and
recorded at 53 Hz by a 36-element Shack-Hartmann sensor. Wavefronts derived
from the beacons are compared with simultaneous wavefronts obtained for
individual natural stars within or near the constellation. Observations were
made in seeing averaging 1.0 arcsec with 2/3 of the aberration measured to be
from a ground layer of mean height 380 m. Under these conditions, subtraction
of the simple instantaneous average of the five beacon wavefronts from the
stellar wavefronts yielded a 40% rms reduction in the measured modes of the
distortion over a 2 arcmin field. We discuss the use of multiple Rayleigh
beacons as an alternative to single sodium beacons on 8 m telescopes, and the
impact of the new work on the design of a multi-sodium beacon system for the 25

wavelengths, several cores emitting at 1.2mm in the same fields show absorption
or no emission at the MIR wavelength. We argue that the absorption is caused by
cold dust. The estimated masses of a few 10^2Msun - 10^3 Msun and the lack of
IR emission suggests that they may be massive cold cores in a pre-stellar
phase, which could presumably form massive stars eventually. Ammonia (1,1) and
(2,2) observations of the cores indicate smaller velocity dispersions and lower
rotation temperatures compared to HMPOs and UCHII regions suggesting a
quiescent pre-stellar stage. We propose that these newly discovered cores are
good candidates for the HMSC stage in high-mass star-formation. This sample of

protostellar accretion by explicitly including the effects of molecular
radiative cooling, gas-dust energy transfer, and cosmic ray heating in models
of spherical hydrodynamic collapse. Isothermal models have previously shown an
initial decline in the mass accretion rate \dot{M}, due to a gradient of infall
speed that develops in the prestellar phase. Our results show that: (1) in the
idealized limit of optically thin cooling, a positive temperature gradient is
present in the prestellar phase which effectively cancels out the effect of the
velocity gradient, producing a near constant \dot{M} in the early accretion
phase; (2) in the more realistic case including cooling saturation at higher
densities, \dot{M} may initially be either weakly increasing or weakly
decreasing with time, for low (T_d ~ 6 K) and high dust temperature (T_d ~ 10
K) cases, respectively. Hence, our results show that the initial decline in
\dot{M} seen in isothermal models is definitely not enhanced by non-isothermal
effects, and is often suppressed by them. In all our models, \dot{M} does
eventually decline rapidly due to the finite mass condition on our cores and a
resulting inward propagating rarefaction wave. Thus, any explanation for a
rapid decline of $\dot{M}$ in the accretion phase likely needs to appeal to the
global molecular cloud structure and possible envelope support, which results
in a finite mass reservoir for cores.

wavelengths, and therefore suitable for observations with the HST Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS). Two of these were discovered by noting an anomalous
emission line (from the source) in the spectrum of a massive early-type galaxy

short-term variability, and all but two ULXs vary on long time scales (over a
baseline of 2.5 years), providing strong evidence that these are accreting
sources. One ULX in NGC5194, source 69, shows possible periodic behavior in its
X-ray flux. We derive a period of 5925\pm200s at a confidence level of 95%,
based on three cycles. This period is lower than the period of 7620\pm500s
derived from a Chandra observation in 2000. The higher effective area of
XMM-Newton enables us to identify multiple components in the spectra of ULXs.
Most ULXs require at least two components -- a power law and a soft X-ray
excess component which is modeled by an optically thin plasma or multicolor
disk blackbody (MCD). However, the soft excess emission, inferred from all ULXs
except source 69, are unlikely to be physically associated with the ULXs as
their strengths are comparable to that of the surrounding diffuse emission. The
soft excess emission of source 69 is well described either by a two temperature
mekal plasma or a single temperature mekal plasma kT~690eV) and an MCD
(kT~170eV). The MCD component suggests a cooler accretion disks compared to
that in Galactic X-ray binaries and consistent with that expected for
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). An iron line (EW 700eV) or K absorption
edge at 7.1keV is present in the EPIC PN spectrum of source 26. The spectrum of

intensity and variability states differing by up to more than a factor of three
in count rate. A time resolved cross correlation analysis between the soft and
hard energy bands revealed that the characteristics of the correlated emission,

Individual spectra, resolved on time scales of a few hundread seconds, can be
quite well fitted by a broken power law. We find significant spectral
variations on time scales as short as 500-1000 sec. Both the hard and the soft
band spectral indices show a non-linear correlation with the source flux. A
comparison of the observed light curves with numerical results from
relativistic hydrodynamic computer simulations of the currently favored

voltages corresponding to energies of some of the vibrational modes. We study
systematically how the position and height of these steps vary as a linear wire

calculations, we find that typically there are several close-lying drops due to
different longitudinal modes. In the experiments, only a single drop is usually
visible, but its width is too large to be accounted for by temperature.
Therefore, to explain the experimental results, we find it necessary to
introduce a finite broadening to the vibrational modes, which makes the

paper we discuss a new approach to earthquake forecasting. This approach is
based on a pattern informatics (PI) method which quantifies temporal variations
in seismicity. The output is a map of areas in a seismogenic region
(``hotspots'') where earthquakes are forecast to occur in a future 10-year time
span. This approach has been successfully applied to California, to Japan, and
on a worldwide basis. These forecasts are binary--an earthquake is forecast
either to occur or to not occur. The standard approach to the evaluation of a
binary forecast is the use of the relative operating characteristic (ROC)
diagram, which is a more restrictive test and less subject to bias than maximum
likelihood tests. To test our PI method, we made two types of retrospective
forecasts for California. The first is the PI method and the second is a
relative intensity (RI) forecast based on the hypothesis that future
earthquakes will occur where earthquakes have occurred in the recent past.
While both retrospective forecasts are for the ten year period 1 January 2000
to 31 December 2009, we performed an interim analysis 5 years into the
forecast. The PI method out performs the RI method under most circumstances.

Furthermore, a quasi-degenerate light neutrino mass spectrum is found to be

neutrino abundance, thermal leptogenesis in the brane requires the decaying
heavy Majorana neutrino mass to be M1 > 10^10 GeV and the fundamental

increases with energy and violates probability conservation the shadowing
effects in the single-scale small $x$ hard QCD processes can be described by an
effective quantum field theory of interacting quasiparticles. The
quasiparticles are the perturbative QCD ladders. We find, within the WKB
approximation, that the smallness of the QCD coupling constant ensures the
hierarchy among many-quasiparticle interactions evaluated within physical
vacuum and in particular, the dominance in the Lagrangian of the triple
quasiparticle interaction. It is explained that the effective field theory
considered near the perturbative QCD vacuum contains a tachyon relevant for the
divergency of the perturbative QCD series at sufficiently small $x$. We solve
the equations of motion of the effective field theory within the WKB
approximation and find the physical vacuum and the transitions between the
false (perturbative) and physical vacua. Classical solutions which dominate
transitions between the false and physical vacua are kinks that cannot be
decomposed into perturbative series over the powers of $\alpha_s$. These kinks
lead to color inflation and the Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles.
The account of the quantum fluctuations around the WKB solution reveals the
appearance of the ""massless"" particles-- ""phonons"". It is explained that
""phonons"" are relevant for the black disc behaviour of small $x$ processes,
leading to a Froissart rise of the cross-section. The condensation of the
ladders produces a color network occupying a ""macroscopic"" longitudinal volume.
We discuss briefly the possible detection of new QCD effects.

the compactification geometry is altered during inflation. In this
configuration, the lowest scale is just above the Hubble scale, which is
compatible with effective field theory but still leads to potentially
observable CMB corrections. Also in the appropriate region of parameter space,
we find that reheating leads to a phase of long open strings in the Standard
Model sector (before the usual radiation-dominated phase). We sketch the

have direct applications in communications theory. Remarkably, no one has been
able to provide exponential improvement on a 100-year-old lower bound on the
maximal packing density due to Minkowski in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space
$\Re^d$. The asymptotic behavior of this bound is controlled by $2^{-d}$ in
high dimensions. Using an optimization procedure that we introduced earlier
\cite{To02c} and a conjecture concerning the existence of disordered sphere
packings in $\Re^d$, we obtain a provisional lower bound on the density whose
asymptotic behavior is controlled by $2^{-0.7786... d}$, thus providing the
putative exponential improvement of Minkowski's bound. The conjecture states
that a hard-core nonnegative tempered distribution is a pair correlation
function of a translationally invariant disordered sphere packing in $\Re^d$
for asymptotically large d if and only if the Fourier transform of the
autocovariance function is nonnegative. The conjecture is supported by two
explicit analytically characterized disordered packings, numerical simulations
in low dimensions, known necessary conditions that only have relevance in very
low dimensions, and the fact that we can recover the forms of known rigorous
lower bounds. A byproduct of our approach is an asymptotic lower bound on the
average kissing number whose behavior is controlled by $2^{0.2213... d}$, which
is to be compared to the best known asymptotic lower bound on the individual
kissing number of $2^{0.2075... d}$. Interestingly, our optimization procedure
is precisely the dual of a primal linear program devised by Cohn and Elkies
\cite{Co03} to obtain upper bounds on the density, and hence has implications
for linear programming bounds.

Hamiltonian is similar to the well-studied, one-degree-of freedom case but is
essentially nonintegrable when the direction of the singular curve in action

familiar features, such as multiple island chains and reconnecting invariant

essential coupling between its two degrees of freedom even when the singular
set is aligned with the resonance module. Using averaging, we approximately
reduced this case to one degree of freedom as well. The resulting Hamiltonian

nervous system units through sequences of action potentials. When these action
potentials have essentially equivalent waveforms, all information is contained
in the interspike intervals (ISIs) of the spike sequence. We address the
question: How do neural circuits recognize and read these ISI sequences?
  Our answer is given in terms of a biologically inspired neural circuit that
we construct using biologically realistic neurons. The essential ingredients of
the ISI Reading Unit (IRU) are (i) a tunable time delay circuit modelled after
one found in the anterior forebrain pathway of the birdsong system and (ii) a
recently observed rule for inhibitory synaptic plasticity. We present a circuit
that can both learn the ISIs of a training sequence using inhibitory synaptic
plasticity and then recognize the same ISI sequence when it is presented on
subsequent occasions. We investigate the ability of this IRU to learn in the
presence of two kinds of noise: jitter in the time of each spike and random
spikes occurring in the ideal spike sequence. We also discuss how the circuit
can be detuned by removing the selected ISI sequence and replacing it by an ISI
sequence with ISIs drawn from a probability distribution.
  We have investigated realizations of the time delay circuit using
Hodgkin-Huxley conductance based neurons connected by realistic excitatory and
inhibitory synapses. Our models for the time delay circuit are tunable from
about 10 ms to 100 ms allowing one to learn and recognize ISI sequences within
that range of ISIs. ISIs down to a few ms and longer than 100 ms are possible
with other intrinsic and synaptic currents in the component neurons.

amenable to exact linear stability analysis, and we compare the analytic
results with large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining the
population size as a function of an average interspecies interaction strength.
Over time, the models self-optimize through mutation and selection to
approximately maximize a community fitness function, subject only to
constraints internal to the particular model. If the interspecies interactions
are randomly distributed on an interval including positive values, the system
evolves toward self-sustaining, mutualistic communities. In contrast, for the
predator-prey case the matrix of interactions is antisymmetric, and a nonzero
population size must be sustained by an external resource. Time series of the
diversity and population size for both models show approximate 1/f noise and
power-law distributions for the lifetimes of communities and species. For the
mutualistic model, these two lifetime distributions have the same exponent,
while their exponents are different for the predator-prey model. The difference
is probably due to greater resilience toward mass extinctions in the food-web
like communities produced by the predator-prey model.
