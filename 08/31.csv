strong Lyalpha absorption lines (W>80 mA) in 31 AGN sight lines studied with
the Hubble Space Telescope and measure corresponding absorption from
higher-order Lyman lines with FUSE. Higher-order Lyman lines are used to
determine N_HI and b_HI accurately through a curve-of-growth (COG) analysis. We
find that the number of HI absorbers per column density bin is a power-law
distribution, dN/dN_HI=N^-beta, with beta_HI=1.68+-0.11. We made 40 detections
of OVI 1032,1038 and 30 detections of CIII 977 out of 129 and 148 potential
absorbers, respectively. The column density distribution of CIII absorbers has
beta_CIII=1.68+-0.04, similar to beta_HI but not as steep as beta_OVI=2.1+-0.1.
  From the absorption-line frequency, dN_CIII/dz=12^+3_-2 for W(CIII)>30 mA, we
calculate a typical IGM absorber size r_0~400 kpc. The COG-derived b-values
show that HI samples material with T<10^5 K, incompatible with a hot IGM phase.
By calculating a grid of CLOUDY models of IGM absorbers with a range of
collisional and photoionization parameters, we find it difficult to
simultaneously account for the OVI and CIII observations with a single phase.
The observations require a multiphase IGM in which HI and CIII arise in
photoionized regions, while OVI is produced primarily through shocks. From the
multiphase ratio N_HI/N_CIII, we infer the IGM metallicity Z_C=0.12 Z_sun,
similar to our previous estimate of Z_O=0.09 Z_sun from OVI.

with optical magnitude R<=21.5 mag and optical emission line spectra
characteristic of AGNs. For the range of luminosity and redshift probed by
AGES, the distribution of estimated Eddington ratios is well described as
log-normal with a peak at L_bol/L_edd ~ 1/4 and a dispersion of 0.3 dex. Since
additional sources of scatter are minimal, this dispersion must account for
contributions from the scatter between estimated and true BH mass and the
scatter between estimated and true bolometric luminosity. Therefore, we
conclude that: (1) neither of these sources of error can contribute more than
\~0.3 dex rms; and (2) the true Eddington ratios of optically luminous AGNs are
even more sharply peaked. Because the mass estimation errors must be smaller
than ~0.3 dex, we can also investigate the distribution of Eddington ratios at
fixed BH mass. We show for the first time that the distribution of Eddington
ratios at fixed BH mass is peaked, and that the dearth of AGNs at a factor ~10
below Eddington is real and not an artifact of sample selection. These results
provide strong evidence that supermassive BHs gain most of their mass while
radiating close to the Eddington limit, and they suggest that the fueling rates

result that the collision is primarily planar, that is, at moderate inclination
relative to the two discs, and prograde for IC 2163, but retrograde for NGC
2207. We list 34 specific morphological or kinematic features on a variety of
scales, found with multi-waveband observations, which we use to constrain the
models. The models are able to reproduce most of these features, with a
relative orbit in which the companion (IC 2163) disc first side-swipes the
primary (NGC 2207) disc on the west side, then moves around the edge of the
primary disc to the north and to its current position on the east side. The
models also provide evidence that the dark matter halo of NGC 2207 has only
moderate extent. For IC 2163, the prolonged prograde disturbance in the model
produces a tidal tail, and an oval or ocular waveform very much like the
observed ones, including some fine structure. The retrograde disturbance in the
model produces no strong waveforms within the primary galaxy. This suggests
that the prominent spiral waves in NGC 2207 were present before the collision,
and models with waves imposed in the initial conditions confirm that they would
not be disrupted by the collision. With an initial central hole in the gas disc
of the primary, and imposed spirals, the model also reproduces the broad ring
seen in HI observations. We believe that this is now one of the best modeled
systems of colliding galaxies. (Abridged)

redshift have been firmly detected in the spectra of several active galactic
nuclei. However, the location of the absorbing gas remains a subject of debate.
To separate the Galactic and extragalactic contributions to the absorption, we
have obtained Chandra LETG-HRC and FUSE observations of the black hole X-ray
binary LMC X--3. A joint analysis of the detected OVII and Ne IX Kalpha lines,
together with the non-detection of the OVII Kbeta and OVIII Kalpha lines, gives
the measurements of the temperature, velocity dispersion, and hot oxygen column
density. The X-ray data also allow us to place a 95% confidence lower limit to
the Ne/O ratio as 0.14. The OVII line centroid and its relative shift from the
Galactic OI Kalpha absorption line, detected in the same observations, are
inconsistent with the systemic velocity of LMC X--3 ($+310 {\rm km s^{-1}}$).
The far-UV spectrum shows OVI absorption at Galactic velocities, but no OVI
absorption is detected at the LMC velocity at $> 3\sigma$ significance. Both
the nonthermal broadening and the decreasing scale height with the increasing
ionization state further suggest an origin of the highly-ionized gas in a
supernova-driven galactic fountain. In addition, we estimate the warm and hot
electron column densities from our detected OVII Kalpha line in the LMC X--3
X-ray spectra and from the dispersion measure of a pulsar in the LMC vicinity.
We then infer the O/H ratio of the gas to be $\gtrsim 8 \times 10^{-5}$,
consistent with the chemically-enriched galactic fountain scenario. We conclude
that the Galactic hot interstellar medium should in general substantially
contribute to zero-redshift X-ray absorption lines in extragalactic sources.

into self-gravitating rings. Growth is faster than disk lifetimes and radial
drift times for moderately strong turbulence, characterized by dimensionless
diffusivities, $\alpha_g < 10^{-6} -- 10^{-3}$ when particles are mm-sized.
This range reflects a strong dependance on disk models. Growth is faster for
higher particle surface densities. Lower gas densities and larger solids also
give faster growth, as long as aerodynamic coupling is tight. In simple power
law models, growth is slowest around ~0.3 AU, where drag coupling is strongest
for mm-sized solids. Growth is much faster close to the star where orbital
times are short, with implications for in situ formation of short period
extrasolar planets. Growth times also decrease toward the outer disk where
lower gas densities allow greater particle settling. Beyond roughly Kuiper Belt
distances however, solids are sufficiently decoupled from gas that dissipative
gravitational instabilities are less effective. Turbulence not only slows
growth, but also increases radial wavelengths. The initial solid mass in an
unstable ring can be ~0.01 M_Earth or greater, huge compared to km-sized
planetesimals. Nonlinear fragmentation, which has not been studied in detail,
will lower the final planetesimal mass. We consider applications to the
asteroid belt and discuss the alternate hypothesis of collisional
agglomeration.

observations of the Galactic center. LGS-AO has dramatically improved the
quality, robustness, and versatility with which high angular resolution
infrared images of the Galactic center can be obtained with the W. M. Keck II
10-meter telescope. Specifically, Strehl ratios of 0.7 and 0.3 at L'[3.8
micron] and K'[2.1 micron], respectively, are achieved in these LGS-AO images.
During our observations, the infrared counterpart to the central supermassive
black hole, Sgr A*-IR, showed significant infrared intensity variations, with
observed L' magnitudes ranging from 12.6 to 14.5 mag. The faintest end of our
L' detections, 1.3 mJy (dereddened), is the lowest level of emission yet
observed for this source by a factor of 3. No significant variation in the
location of SgrA*-IR is detected as a function of either wavelength or
intensity. Near a peak in its intensity, we obtained the first measurement of
SgrA*-IR's K'-L' color (3.0 +- 0.2 mag, observed), which corresponds to an
intrinsic spectral index of -0.5 +- 0.3. This is significantly bluer than other
recent infrared measurements. Because our measurement was taken at a time when
Sgr A* was ~6 times brighter in the infrared than the other measurements, we
posit that the spectral index of the emission arising from the vicinity of our
Galaxy's central black hole may depend on the strength of the flare, with
stronger flares giving rise to a higher fraction of high energy electrons in
the emitting region.

(MRI) in liquid metal, we present non-ideal two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the nonlinear evolution of MRI in the experimental geometry. The
simulations adopt initially uniform vertical magnetic fields, conducting radial
boundaries, and periodic vertical boundary conditions. No-slip conditions are
imposed at the cylinders. Our linear growth rates compare well with existing
local and global linear analyses. The MRI saturates nonlinearly with horizontal
magnetic fields comparable to the initial axial field. The rate of angular
momentum transport increases modestly but significantly over the initial state.
For modest fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers Re, Rm between 100 and 1000, the
final state is laminar reduced mean shear except near the radial boundaries,
and with poloidal circulation scaling as the square root of resistivity, in
partial agreement with the analysis of Knobloch and Julien. A sequence of
simulations at Rm=20 and 100 < Re < 25,600 enables extrapolation to the
experimental regime (Rm ~ 20, Re ~ 10^7), albeit with unrealistic boundary
conditions. MRI should increase the experimentally measured torque
substantially over its initial purely hydrodynamic value.

But for the Milky Way obtaining the complete rotation curve is a more complex

Following a brief introduction of the LSC, we describe the results of early

describe next the three-dimensional analysis, which is used widely today.
Difficulties and systematic effects are explained and the importance of
selection effects is described. Then, results based on the new method and
modern databases are given, which are summarized as follows. When the LSC is
seen as a whole, galaxy planes tend to align perpendicular to the LSC plane
with lenticulars showing the most pronounced tendency. Projections onto the LSC
plane of the spin vectors of Virgo cluster member galaxies, and to some extent,
those of the total LSC galaxies, tend to point to the Virgo cluster center.
This tendency is more pronounced for lenticulars than for spirals. It is
suggested that 'field' galaxies, i.e., those which do not belong to groups with
more than three members, may be better objects than other galaxies to probe the
information at the early epoch of the LSC formation through the analysis of
galaxy orientations. Field lenticulars show a pronounced anisotropic
distribution of spin vectors in the sense that they lay their spin vectors
parallel to the LSC plane while field spirals show an isotropic spin-vector
distribution.

that our planetary system is dynamically stable at least +/- Gyr, the dynamics
of our Solar System includes both chaotic and stable motions: the large planets
exhibit remarkable stability on gigayear timescales, while the subsystem of the
terrestrial planets is weekly chaotic with a maximum Lyapunov exponent reaching
the value of 1/5 Myr. In this paper the dynamics of the
Sun--Venus--Earth--Mars-Jupiter--Saturn model is studied, where the mass of
Earth was magnified via a mass factor $\kappa_E$. The resulting systems
dominated by a massive Earth may serve also as models for exoplanetary systems
that are similar to our one. This work is a continuation of our previous study,
where the same model was used and the masses of the inner planets were
uniformly magnified. That model was found to be substantially stable against
the mass growth. Our simulations were undertaken for more then 100 different
values of K for a time of 20, in some cases for 100 Myrs. A major result was
the appearance of an instability window at K = 5, where Mars escaped. This new
result has important implications for the theories of the planetary system
formation process and mechanism. It is shown that with increasing K the system
splits into two, well separated subsystems: one consists of the inner, the
other one consists of the outer planets. According to the results the model
became more stable as K increases and only when K >= 540 Mars escaped, on a Myr
timescale. We found an interesting protection mechanism for Venus. These
results give insights also to the stability of the habitable zone of
exoplanetary systems, which harbour planets with relatively small
eccentricities and inclinations.

difference Eulerian codes, we analyze the effect that a toroidal magnetic field
has on low mass planet migration in nonturbulent protoplanetary discs. The
presence of the magnetic field modifies the waves that can propagate in the
disc. In agreement with a recent linear analysis (Terquem 2003), we find that
two magnetic resonances develop on both sides of the planet orbit, which
contribute to a significant global torque. In order to measure the torque
exerted by the disc on the planet, we perform simulations in which the latter
is either fixed on a circular orbit or allowed to migrate. For a 5 earth mass
planet, when the ratio \beta between the square of the sound speed and that of
the Alfven speed at the location of the planet is equal to 2, we find inward
migration when the magnetic field B_{\phi} is uniform in the disc, reduced
migration when B_{\phi} decreases as r^{-1} and outward migration when B_{\phi}
decreases as r^{-2}. These results are in agreement with predictions from the
linear analysis. Taken as a whole, our results confirm that even a subthermal
stable field can stop inward migration of an earth--like planet.

hierarchical building up of the structure determines a characteristic stellar
mass at M_c ~10^10.2 Moh^-1 which exhibits approximately solar metallicities
from z ~ 3 to z=0. This characteristic mass separates galactic systems in two

relation driven mainly by the low mass systems which exhibit the larger

empirical techniques are routinely employed for the analysis of the emission
line spectra of these objects, the accurate interpretation of the observational
data often requires the solution of a set of coupled equations, via the
application of a photoionisation/plasma code. A number of large-scale codes
have been developed since the late sixties, using various analytical or
statistical techniques for the transfer of continuum radiation, mainly under
the assumption of spherical symmetry and a few in 3D. These codes have been
proved to be powerful and in many cases essential tools, but a clear idea of
the underlying physical processes and assumptions is necessary in order to
avoid reaching misleading conclusions. A brief review of the field of
photoionisation today is given here, with emphasis on the recent developments,
including the expansion of the models to the 3D domain. Attention is given to
the identification of new available observational constraints and how these can
used to extract useful information from realistic models. (abridged)

account for the observed reduction of the resistance. We concentrate on the

two-electron scattering, so as these dominate the conductance. Our calculation
shows that the effective charge, probed by the shot noise of such a system,
approaches a value proportional to e* = 2e at sufficiently large backscattering

Andreev reflected as a hole into an adjacent, oppositely polarized, domain
while a pair is transmitted into S. CARE is possible in SRO since the width of
its domain walls is of the order of the YBCO coherence length (2-3 nm). Our
junctions behave as typical magnetic tunneling junctions, as the conductance
spectra were always asymmetric, and a few showed bound state peaks at finite
bias that shifted with field according to the classical Tedrow and Meservey
theory. In many of our SFS junctions with a barrier thickness of 10-20 nm, a
prominent zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) has been observed. This peak was
found to decrease \textit{linearly} with magnetic field, as expected for
Andreev and CARE scattering. In contrast, in SF junctions, the observed ZBCP
was found to decrease versus field almost \textit{exponentially}, in agreement
with the Anderson-Appelbaum theory of scattering by magnetic states in F. Thus,
transport in our SFS and SF junctions depends strongly on the size of the F

decreased with increasing magnetic order of the domains in F, in agreement with
the CARE mechanism.

magnetoresistive tunnelling and electric field effects. Spinel oxides appear as

NiFe2O4 films onto perovskite substrates allows the stabilization of novel
ferrite phases with properties dramatically differing from bulk ones. Indeed,
NiFe2O4 films few nanometres thick have a saturation magnetization at least
twice that of the bulk compound and their resistivity can be tuned by orders of
magnitude, depending on the growth conditions. By integrating such thin NiFe2O4
layers into spin-dependent tunnelling heterostructures, we demonstrate that
this versatile material can be useful for spintronics, either as a conductive
electrode in magnetic tunnel junctions or as a spin-filtering insulating
barrier in the little explored type of tunnel junction called spin-filter. Our
findings are thus opening the way for the realisation of monolithic spintronics
architectures integrating several layers of a single material, where the layers

exponents are determined for the inverse moments of the counterionic density
profile (which play the role of the order parameters and represent the inverse
localization length of counterions) both within mean-field theory and within
Monte-Carlo simulations. In three dimensions (3D), correlation effects
(neglected within mean-field theory) lead to an excessive accumulation of
counterions near the charged cylinder below the critical temperature
(condensation phase), while surprisingly, the critical region exhibits
universal critical exponents in accord with the mean-field theory. In two

approaches, that the mean-field theory becomes exact at all temperatures
(Manning parameters), when number of counterions tends to infinity. For finite
particle number, however, the 2D problem displays a series of peculiar singular
points (with diverging heat capacity), which reflect successive de-localization
events of individual counterions from the central cylinder. In both 2D and 3D,
the heat capacity shows a universal jump at the critical point, and the energy
develops a pronounced peak. The asymptotic behavior of the energy peak location

attention is paid to the systematic uncertainties, which dominate the
statistical errors after one LHC year at low luminosity (10 fb^{-1}), and to
the background estimate. Combining results from both channel studies, the
longitudinal component of the W polarization (F\_0) can be measured with a 2%
accuracy and the right-handed component (F\_R) with a 1% precision with 10
fb^{-1}. Even though the top quarks in ttbar pairs are not polarized, a large
asymmetry is expected within the Standard Model in the like-spin versus

possible with 10 fb^{-1}, after combining results from both channel studies.

Overhauser channel -- for SU(2) lattice gauge theory in minimal Landau gauge.
The off-diagonal components of the momentum-space ghost propagator G^{cd}(p)
are evaluated for lattice volumes V = 8^4, 12^4, 16^4, 20^4, 24^4 and for three
values of the lattice coupling: \beta = 2.2, 2.3, 2.4. Our data show that the
quantity \phi^b(p) = \epsilon^{bcd} G^{cd}(p) / 2 is zero within error bars,
being characterized by very large statistical fluctuations. On the contrary,
|\phi^b(p)| has relatively small error bars and behaves at small momenta as
L^{-2} p^{-z}, where L is the lattice side in physical units and z \approx 4.
We argue that the large fluctuations for \phi^b(p) come from spontaneous
breaking of a global symmetry and are associated with ghost condensation. It
may thus be necessary (in numerical simulations at finite volume) to consider
|\phi^b(p)| instead of \phi^b(p), to avoid a null average due to tunneling
between different broken vacua. Also, we show that \phi^b(p) is proportional to
the Fourier-transformed gluon field components {\widetilde A}_{\mu}^b(q). This
explains the L^{-2} dependence of |\phi^b(p)|, as induced by the behavior of |
{\widetilde A}_{\mu}^b(q) |. We fit our data for |\phi^b(p)| to the theoretical
prediction (r / L^2 + v) / (p^4 + v^2), obtaining for the ghost condensate v an
upper bound of about 0.058 GeV^2. In order to check if v is nonzero in the
continuum limit, one probably needs numerical simulations at much larger
physical volumes than the ones we consider. As a by-product of our analysis, we
perform a careful study of the color structure of the inverse Faddeev-Popov
matrix in momentum space.

duality. One idea to overcome this deficiency, as claimed recently, is imposing
nontrivial measures for the ensemble sum. We address this problem and upon a
redefinition of the OSV ensemble whose variables are as numerous as the
electric potentials, show that for restoring the symmetry no non-Euclidean
measure is needful. In detail, we rewrite the OSV free energy as a function of
new variables which are combinations of the electric-potentials and the black
hole charges. Subsequently the Legendre transformation which bridges between
the entropy and the black hole free energy in terms of these variables, points
to a generalized ensemble. In this context, we will consider all the cases of
relevance: small and large black holes, with or without D_6-brane charge. For
the case of vanishing D_6-brane charge, the new ensemble is pure canonical and
the electric-magnetic duality is restored exactly, leading to proper results
for the black hole degeneracy of states. For more general cases, the
construction still works well as far as the violation of the duality by the
corresponding OSV result is restricted to a prefactor. In a concrete example we
shall show that for black holes with non-vanishing D_6-brane charge, there are
cases where the duality violation goes beyond this restriction, thus imposing
non-trivial measures is incapable of restoring the duality. This observation
signals for a deeper modification in the OSV proposal.

a deformation of the non-commutative gauge theory, whose structure survives.
The derivation is applied to the tachyon field, whose potential is shown to be

the coupling of p-adic strings to a magnetic field, thus allowing to study
p-adic solitons using non-commutative field-theory techniques. The link with

mirror symmetry with D-branes on a Calabi--Yau manifold admitting a

unifying Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian D-branes of the A-model as mirrors of

and others, that if a given rational ODE has a Liouvillian first integral then
the corresponding integrating factor of the ODE must be of a very special form
of a product of powers and exponents of irreducible polynomials. These results
lead to a partial algorithm for finding Liouvillian first integrals. However,
there are two main complications on the way to obtaining polynomials in the
integrating factor form. First of all, one has to find an upper bound for the
degrees of the polynomials in the product above, an unsolved problem, and then
the set of coefficients for each of the polynomials by the
computationally-intensive method of undetermined parameters. As a result, this
approach was implemented in CAS only for first and relatively simple second
order ODEs. We propose an algebraic method for finding polynomials of the
integrating factors for rational ODEs of any order, based on examination of the
resultants of the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator of the
right-hand side of such equation. If both the numerator and the denominator of
the right-hand side of such ODE are not constants, the method can determine in
finite terms an explicit expression of an integrating factor if the ODE permits
integrating factors of the above mentioned form and then the Liouvillian first
integral. The tests of this procedure based on the proposed method, implemented
in Maple in the case of rational integrating factors, confirm the consistence
and efficiency of the method.

approximate dynamics for the actions given by averaging over the angle. The
classical theory grants that, for a perturbation of order epsilon, the error of
this approximation is O(epsilon) on a time scale O(1/epsilon), for epsilon ->
0. We replace this qualitative statement with a fully quantitative estimate; in
certain cases, our approach also gives a reliable error estimate on time scales
larger than 1/epsilon. A number of examples are presented; in many cases our
estimator practically coincides with the envelope of the rapidly oscillating
distance between the actions of the perturbed and of the averaged systems.
Fairly good results are also obtained in some ""resonant"" cases, where the
angular frequency is small along the trajectory of the system. Even though our
estimates are proved theoretically, their computation in specific applications
typically requires the numerical solution of a system of differential
equations. However, the time scale for this system is smaller by a factor
epsilon than the time scale for the perturbed system. For this reason,
computation of our estimator is faster than the direct numerical solution of
the perturbed system; the estimator is rapidly found also in cases when the
time scale makes impossible (within reasonable CPU times) or unreliable the
direct solution of the perturbed system.

componentwise linear when s <= 3 or when J_i \cup J_j = [n] for all i \neq j.
When s >= 4, we give examples to show that I may or may not be componentwise

existence of certain polytopes. This result is based on a complete
characterization of the standard pairs/associated primes of a monomial initial

feasible permutations via an isomorphic problem in enumerative combinatorics.
Almost all enumerative chess problems have been ``series-movers'', in which one
side plays an uninterrupted series of moves, unanswered except possibly for one
move by the opponent at the end. This can be convenient for setting up
enumeration problems, but we show that other problem genres also lend
themselves to composing enumerative problems. Some of the resulting
enumerations cannot be shown (or have not yet been shown) in series-movers.

dispersion limit of the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation is
investigated analytically and numerically for piecewise-constant initial data.
In particular, the dynamics of constant-amplitude initial conditions with one
or more frequency jumps (i.e., piecewise linear phase) are considered. It is
shown analytically and numerically that, for finite times, regions of
arbitrarily high genus can be produced; asymptotically with time, however, the
solution can be divided into expanding regions which are either of genus-zero,
genus-one or genus-two type, their precise arrangement depending on the
specifics of the initial datum given. This behavior should be compared to that
of the Korteweg-deVries equation, where the solution is devided into the
regions which are either genus-zero or genus-one asymptotically. Finally, the
potential application of these results to the generation of short optical
pulses is discussed: the method proposed takes advantage of nonlinear
compression via appropriate frequency modulation, and allows control of both
the pulse amplitude and its width, as well as the distance along the fiber at
which the pulse is produced.

bottleneck. Single-vehicle data generated by several 'virtual detectors' show a
semi-quantitative agreement with microscopic data from the Dutch freeway A9.
This includes the observed distributions of the net time headways and
times-to-collision for free and congested traffic. While the times-to-collision
show a nearly universal distribution in free and congested traffic, the modal
value of the time headway distribution is shifted by a factor of about two in
congested conditions. Macroscopically, this corresponds to the 'capacity drop'
at the transition from free to congested traffic. Finally, we explain the wide
scattering of one-minute flow-density data by a self-organized variance-driven
process that leads to the spontaneous formation and decay of long-lived
platoons even for deterministic dynamics on a single lane.

modified using standard hydrodynamic principles to include effects of air
temperature, pressure, and humidity levels on aerodynamic drag. The magnitude
of the effects are found to be dependent on wind speed. This implies that
differing atmospheric conditions can yield slightly different corrections for
the same wind gauge reading. In the absence of wind, temperature is found to
induce the largest variation in times (0.01 s per $10\dc$ increment in the 100
m), while relative humidity contributes the least (under 0.01 s for all
realistic conditions for 100 m). Barometric pressure variations at a particular
venue can also introduce fluctuations in performance times on the order of a
0.01 s for this race. The combination of all three variables is essentially
additive, and is more important for head-wind conditions that for tail-winds.
As expected, calculated corrections in the 200 m are magnified due to the
longer duration of the race. The overall effects of these factors on sprint
times can be considered a ``second order'' adjustment to previous methods which
rely strictly on a venue's physical elevation, but can become important in
extreme conditions.

in order to interpret experimental results, it is important to relate invariant
physical quantities to some reference frame. In this paper, passive Lorentz

We calculate the charge and current densities induced by a nuclear Coulomb
field in the presence of a laser field. We find the corresponding induced
scalar and vector potentials. The induced potential, in first-order
perturbation theory, leads to a correction to atomic energy levels. The
external laser field breaks the rotational symmetry of the system.
Consequently, the induced charge density is not spherically symmetric, and the
energy correction therefore leads to a ""polarized Lamb shift."" In particular,
the laser generates an additional potential with a quadrupole moment. The
corresponding laser-dressed vacuum-polarization potential behaves like 1/r**3
at large distances, unlike the Uehling potential that vanishes exponentially
for large r. Our investigation might be useful for other situations where
quantum field theoretic phenomena are subjected to external fields of a rather

(in the renormalization group sense) as the best-suited for finite-size scaling
analysis. The proposed method is checked on a couple of one-dimensional spin
