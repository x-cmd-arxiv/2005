planetary nebulae (PNs) NGC 40 and Hen 2-99. Both PNs feature late-type
Wolf-Rayet central stars that are presently driving fast ~1000 km/s, massive
winds into denser, slow-moving (~10 km/s) material ejected during recently
terminated asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutionary phases. Hence, these
observations provide key tests of models of wind-wind interactions in PNs. In
NGC 40, we detect faint, diffuse X-ray emission distributed within a partial
annulus that lies nested within a ~40'' diameter ring of nebulosity observed in
optical and near-infrared images. Hen 2-99 is undetected. The inferred X-ray
temperature (T_X ~10^6 K) and luminosity (L_X ~ 2 X 10^30 ergs/s) of NGC 40 are
the lowest measured thus far for any PN displaying diffuse X-ray emission.
These results, combined with the ring-like morphology of the X-ray emission
from NGC 40, suggest that its X-ray emission arises from a ``hot bubble'' that
is highly evolved and is generated by a shocked, quasi-spherical fast wind from
the central star, as opposed to AGB or post-AGB jet activity. In constrast, the
lack of detectable X-ray emission from Hen 2-99 suggests that this PN has yet
to enter a phase of strong wind-wind shocks.

and surface brightness, but the nature of their power source is unclear - with
cooling flows and/or AGN/starburst ionised winds being possibilities. Using the
SCUBA submm camera we measure the 850um flux of a sample of LABs, detecting
four LABs at >3.5sigma individually, and a modest statistical detection of the
full sample at about 3mJy. These fluxes correspond to bolometric luminosities
in the ultraluminous regime, with star-formation rates of about 1e3 Msun/yr. We
show there is a trend between Lya luminosity and bolometric output, which
suggests that a galactic scale superwind generated from starbursts of age
10-100Myr may be responsible for the Lya emission. We estimate the
star-formation rate density in SA22 to be >3 Msun/yr/Mpc^3 - greater than the
field at this epoch, and note that there are now 7 submm galaxies in the SA22

in the past to determine the shape of the dark matter halo. Previous studies
based on this concept suggest a slightly oblate halo (axis ratio ~ 0.8) for our
Galaxy. We reinvestigate this problem by calculating the HI scaleheight in the
outer Galaxy to a larger radial distance, and by studying its dependence on the
shape and the density profile of the halo. We find that a simple isothermal
infinite halo of any shape- oblate or prolate, is not able to account for the
observed flaring. Instead we show that a spherical halo with density falling
faster than isothermal halo in the outer region provides a better fit to the
observed HI flaring as well as the observed rotation curve of our Galaxy. These
halos have about 95% of their mass within a few hundreds of kpc. For R_solar =
8.5 kpc and \Theta_solar = 220 km/s, the central density and core radius can be
constrained to the range \rho_0 = 0.035 - 0.06 M_sun/pc^3 and R_c = 8 - 10 kpc.
Our claim for such 'finite-sized' spherical halos is supported by recent

stellar-radiation intensity and pair-production threshold. We apply our results

many stars will have a measurable acceleration due to their companion, which
must be included when solving for astrometric parameters and searching for
planetary perturbations. Additionally, many of the stars with one radial
velocity planet show indications of additional planets. Therefore, astrometric
surveys like SIM must be capable of detecting planets and measuring orbital
parameters in systems with multiple stellar and/or planetary companions. We
have conducted Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how the presence of
multiple companions affects the sensitivity of an astrometric survey such as
SIM. We find that the detection efficiency for planets in wide binary systems
is relatively unaffected by the presence of a binary companion, if the
planetary orbital period is less than half the duration of the astrometric
survey. For longer orbital periods, there are significant reductions in the
sensitivity of an astrometric survey. Additionally, we find that the signal
required to detect a planet can be increased significantly due to the presence
of an additional planet orbiting the same star. Fortunately, adding a modest
number of precision radial velocity observations significantly improves the
sensitivity for many multiple planet systems. Thus, the combination of radial
velocity observations and astrometric observations by SIM will be a
particularly valuable for studying multiple planet systems.

identify only one important effect: we measure 40 +/- 20% higher O_dla values
toward a subset of brighter quasars than toward a faint subset. This effect
runs contrary to the bias associated with dust obscuration and suggests that
gravitational lensing may be important. Comparing the results against models of
galaxy formation, we find all of the models significantly underpredict l(X) at
z=3 and only SPH models with significant feedback may reproduce O_dla at high
redshift. We argue that the Lyman limit systems contribute ~1/3 of the
universe's HI atoms at all redshifts z=2 to 5 and that the f(N) distribution
for N(HI)<10^20 has an inflection with slope >-1. We advocate a new mass
density definition -- the mass density of predominantly neutral gas O_neut --
to be contrasted with the mass density of gas associated with HI atoms. We
contend the damped Lya systems contribute >80% of O_neut at all redshifts and
therefore are the main reservoirs for star formation. [abridged]

weak influence on the distributions of $B/T$, effective radius and S\'ersic

the S\'ersic index distribution peaks at $3<n<4$. However, the mass ratio is
tightly linked to the properties of the outer exponential components which

elongated heated discs for 6:1 remnants. We found distinct correlations between
the fitting parameters which are very similar to observed relations (e.g.
larger bulges have lower effective surface densities). No indications for a
correlation between the surface density profiles and other global parameters
are found. The remnants have properties similar to giant elliptical galaxies in
the intermediate mass regime. A binary disc merger origin for all early-type
galaxies, especially the most massive ones, is unlikely. Observed nearby merger

dimensional, spherically symmetric spectrum synthesis calculations show that
reproducing features in the observed spectra, i.e., the sharply peaked [OI]
6300\AA doublet and MgI] 4570\AA emission, and the broad [FeII] blend around
5200\AA, requires the existence of a high-density O-rich core expanding at low
velocities ($\lsim 8,000$ km s$^{-1}$) and of Fe-rich material moving faster
than the O-rich material. Synthetic spectra at late phases from aspherical
(bipolar) explosion models are also computed with a two-dimensional spectrum
synthesis code. The above features are naturally explained by the aspherical
model if the explosion is viewed from a direction close to the axis of symmetry
($\sim 30^{\rm o}$), since the aspherical model yields a high-density O-rich
region confined along the equatorial axis. By examining a large parameter space
(in energy and mass), our best model gives following physical quantities: the
kinetic energy $E_{51} \equiv E_{\rm K}/10^{51}$ ergs $\gsim 8 - 12$ and the
main-sequence mass of the progenitor star $M_{\rm ms} \gsim 30 - 35 \Msun$. The

magnetized Bonnor-Ebert-Spheres whose properties are taken directly from
observations. In contrast to the pure hydro case where no outflows are seen,
our present simulations show an outflow from the protodisk surface at ~ AU and
a jet at ~ 0.07 AU after a strong toroidal magnetic field build up. The large
scale outflow, which extends up to ~ AU at the end of our simulation, is driven
by toroidal magnetic pressure (spring), whereas the jet is powered by
magneto-centrifugal force (fling). At the final stage of our simulation these
winds are still confined within two respective shock fronts. Furthermore, we
find that the jet-wind and the disk-anchored magnetic field extracts a
considerable amount of angular momentum from the protostellar disk. The initial
spin of our cloud core was chosen high enough to produce a binary system. We
indeed find a close binary system (separation ~ 3 R_sol) which results from the
fragmentation of an earlier formed ring structure. The magnetic field strength
in these protostars reaches ~ 3 kG and becomes about 3 G at 1 AU from the

gaps are found to be sensitive to the exchange contrast between the constituent

each node moves independently on a unit disk according to a stationary uniform

Gamal, Mammen, Prabhakar and Shah (2004) showed that the delay associated with
this throughput scales as $\Theta(n\log n)$, when each node moves according to
an independent random walk. In a later work, Diggavi, Grossglauser and Tse
(2002) considered a random network on a sphere with a restricted mobility
model, where each node moves along a randomly chosen great circle on the unit
sphere. They showed that even with this one-dimensional restriction on
mobility, constant throughput scaling is achievable. Thus, this particular
mobility restriction does not affect the throughput scaling. This raises the
question whether this mobility restriction affects the delay scaling.
  This paper studies the delay scaling at $\Theta(1)$ throughput for a random
network with restricted mobility. First, a variant of the scheme presented by
Diggavi, Grossglauser and Tse (2002) is presented and it is shown to achieve
$\Theta(1)$ throughput using different (and perhaps simpler) techniques. The
exact order of delay scaling for this scheme is determined, somewhat
surprisingly, to be of $\Theta(n\log n)$, which is the same as that without the
mobility restriction. Thus, this particular mobility restriction \emph{does
not} affect either the maximal throughput scaling or the corresponding delay
scaling of the network. This happens because under this 1-D restriction, each
node is in the proximity of every other node in essentially the same manner as
without this restriction.

constrained communication strategy in which each node has only a local view of
the network, meaning that nodes can only transmit to and decode from
neighboring nodes. We compare this with omniscient coding, in which every node
has a global view of the network and all nodes can cooperate. Using Gaussian
channels as examples, we find that when the nodes transmit at low power, the
rates achievable with two-hop myopic coding are as large as that under
omniscient coding in a five-node multiple relay channel and close to that under
omniscient coding in a six-node multiple relay channel. These results suggest
that we may do local coding and cooperation without compromising much on the
transmission rate. Practically, myopic coding schemes are more robust to
topology changes because encoding and decoding at a node are not affected when
there are changes at remote nodes. Furthermore, myopic coding mitigates the
high computational complexity and large buffer/memory requirements of
omniscient coding.

version of the resummed post-Newtonian Hamiltonian defined by the Effective
One-Body approach. We focus on the influence of spin terms onto the dynamics
and waveforms. We evaluate the energy and angular momentum released during the
final stage of inspiral and plunge. For an equal-mass binary the energy
released between 40Hz and the frequency beyond which our analytical treatment
becomes unreliable is found to be, when using the more reliable Effective
One-Body dynamics: 0.6% M for anti-aligned maximally spinning black holes, 5% M
for aligned maximally spinning black hole, and 1.8% M for non-spinning
configurations. In confirmation of previous results, we find that, for all
binaries considered, the dimensionless rotation parameter J/E^2 is always
smaller than unity at the end of the inspiral, so that a Kerr black hole can
form right after the inspiral phase. By matching a quasi-normal mode ringdown
to the last reliable stages of the plunge, we construct complete waveforms
approximately describing the gravitational wave signal emitted by the entire
process of coalescence of precessing binaries of spinning black holes.

for the TE modes. The entropy is thus bounded. The present kind of formalism
makes it convenient to study also the influence from frequency dispersion. We

tensionless branes with energy distributed over singletonic partons on the

found. First, each cusp yields D-2 normal-coordinate bound states with
protected frequencies (for p>2 there are additional bound states); and can
moreover be related to a short open p-brane whose tension diverges at the AdS
boundary leading to a decoupled singular CFT at the ``brane at the
end-of-the-universe''. Second, discretizing the closed p-brane and keeping the
number N of discrete partons finite yields an sp(2N)-gauged phase-space sigma
model giving rise to symmetrized N-tupletons of the minimal higher-spin algebra
ho_0(D-1,2)\supset so(D-1,2). The continuum limit leads to a 2d chiral
sp(2)-gauged sigma model which is critical in D=7; equivalent a la
Bars-Vasiliev to an su(2)-gauged spinor string; and furthermore dual to a WZW
model in turn containing a topological \hat{so}(6,2)_{-2}/(\hat{so}(6)\oplus

weight-0 spin fields. Moreover, the two-parton truncation can be linked via a

the phase space of the D-dimensional Dirac hypercone. We present evidence that
a suitable deformation of the open string leads to the Vasiliev equations based
on vector oscillators and weak sp(2)-projection. Geometrically, the bi-locality

certain prescribed conditions. In contrast to similar questions of this form,
(rho) is allowed to have arbitrary ramification at some prime of Z[sqrt(-2)].

models from available data, supported by well established theoretical results
and an efficient algorithm, is presented. The method reduces the problem of
estimating LLS model parameters to a sequence of linear algebra problems. This
assures a low computational complexity and an ability to handle large scale
data that involve thousands of variables. An overall computational scheme and
all its components are discussed in detail. Simulation experiments demonstrate
the excellent performance of the algorithm in reconstructing model parameters.
Step-by-step analysis of a demographic survey is presented as an example.
  The technique is useful for the analysis of high-dimensional categorical data
(e.g., demographic surveys, gene expression data) where the detection,
evaluation, and interpretation of a underlying latent structure are required.

been transferred to a ``non-commutative'' setting in two different directions:
C.-H. Chu and A. T.-M. Lau replaced the algebra $L^\infty(G)$ by the group von
Neumann algebra $VN(G)$ and the convolution action of a probability measure
$\mu$ on $L^\infty(G)$ by the canonical action of a positive definite function
$\sigma$ on $\VN(G)$; on the other hand, W. Jaworski and the first-named author
replaced $L^\infty(G)$ by $B(L^2(G))$ to which the convolution action by $\mu$
can be extended in a natural way. We establish a link between both approaches.
The action of $\sigma$ on $VN(G)$ can be extended to $B (L^2(G))$. We study the
corresponding space $\tilde{H}_\sigma$ of ``$\sigma$-harmonic operators'',
i.e., fixed points in $B(L^2(G))$ under the action of $\sigma$. We show, under
mild conditions on either $\sigma$ or $G$, that $\tilde{H}_\sigma$ is in fact a
von Neumann subalgebra of $B (L^2(G))$. Our investigation of $\tilde{H}_\sigma$
relies, in particular, on a notion of support for an arbitrary operator in
$B(L^2(G))$ that extends Eymard's definition for elements of $VN(G)$. Finally,
we present an approach to $\tilde{H}_\sigma$ via ideals in $T (L^2(G))$ - where
$T(L^2(G))$ denotes the trace class operators on $L^2(G)$, but equipped with a
product different from composition -, as it was pioneered for harmonic
functions by G. A. Willis.

mechanical systems and applies it to the variational integration of mechanical
systems with abelian symmetry. The reduction of variational Runge-Kutta
discretizations is considered, as well as the extent to which symmetry
reduction and discretization commute. These reduced methods allow the direct
simulation of dynamical features such as relative equilibria and relative
periodic orbits that can be obscured or difficult to identify in the unreduced
dynamics. The methods are demonstrated for the dynamics of an Earth orbiting
satellite with a non-spherical $J_2$ correction, as well as the double
spherical pendulum. The $J_2$ problem is interesting because in the unreduced
picture, geometric phases inherent in the model and those due to numerical
discretization can be hard to distinguish, but this issue does not appear in
the reduced algorithm, where one can directly observe interesting dynamical
structures in the reduced phase space (the cotangent bundle of shape space), in
which the geometric phases have been removed. The main feature of the double
spherical pendulum example is that it has a nontrivial magnetic term in its
reduced symplectic form. Our method is still efficient as it can directly
handle the essential non-canonical nature of the symplectic structure. In
contrast, a traditional symplectic method for canonical systems could require
repeated coordinate changes if one is evoking Darboux' theorem to transform the
symplectic structure into canonical form, thereby incurring additional
computational cost. Our method allows one to design reduced symplectic
integrators in a natural way, despite the noncanonical nature of the symplectic
structure.

i.e., localized waves existing inside the phonon band in a nonlinear
dynamical-lattice model. The model describes a one-dimensional array of optical
waveguides with both the quadratic (second-harmonic generation) and cubic
nonlinearities. A rich family of ESs was previously known in the continuum
limit of the model. First, a simple motivating problem is considered, in which
the cubic nonlinearity acts in a single waveguide. An explicit solution is
constructed asymptotically in the large-wavenumber limit. The general problem
is then shown to be equivalent to the existence of a homoclinic orbit in a
four-dimensional reversible map. From properties of such maps, it is shown that
(unlike ordinary gap solitons), discrete ESs have the same codimension as their
continuum counterparts. A specific numerical method is developed to compute
homoclinic solutions of the map, that are symmetric under a specific reversing
transformation. Existence is then studied in the full parameter space of the
problem. Numerical results agree with the asymptotic results in the appropriate
limit and suggest that the discrete ESs may be semi-stable as in the continuous
case.

large particles with anisotropy factor, g, in the range 0.8 to 0.97. For the
time-resolved case, the backscattered light with the same helicity as that of
the incident beam (co-polarized) is found to form a ring centered on the point
of incidence. The ring expands and simultaneously grows weak as time increases.
The intensity of backscattered light with helicity opposite to that of the
incident beam (cross-polarized) is found to exhibit a ring behavior for
g>=0.85, with significant backscattering at the point of incidence. For the
continuous-wave case no such ring pattern is observed in backscattered light
for either helicity. The present EMC study suggests that the ring behavior can
only be observed in the time domain, in contrast to previous studies of light
backscattered from forward scattering media based on the scalar
time-independent Fokker-Planck approximation to the radiative transfer
equation. The time-dependent ring structure of backscattered light may have

coefficient matrix by extracting a network of relevant interactions. This
method succeeds to generate networks with the same hierarchical structure of
the Minimum Spanning Tree but containing a larger amount of links resulting in
a richer network topology allowing loops and cliques. In Tumminello et al.
\cite{TumminielloPNAS05}, we have shown that this method, applied to a
financial portfolio of 100 stocks in the USA equity markets, is pretty
efficient in filtering relevant information about the clustering of the system
and its hierarchical structure both on the whole system and within each
cluster. In particular, we have found that triangular loops and 4 element
cliques have important and significant relations with the market structure and
properties. Here we apply this filtering procedure to the analysis of
correlation in two different kind of interest rate time series (16 Eurodollars
and 34 US interest rates).

  Disease","5 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. Lett",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.148104",,"q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph",,"  The immune system normally protects the human host against death by
infection. However, when an immune response is mistakenly directed at self
antigens, autoimmune disease can occur. We describe a model of protein
evolution to simulate the dynamics of the adaptive immune response to antigens.
Computer simulations of the dynamics of antibody evolution show that different
evolutionary mechanisms, namely gene segment swapping and point mutation, lead
to different evolved antibody binding affinities. Although a combination of
gene segment swapping and point mutation can yield a greater affinity to a
specific antigen than point mutation alone, the antibodies so evolved are
highly cross-reactive and would cause autoimmune disease, and this is not the
chosen dynamics of the immune system. We suggest that in the immune system a
balance has evolved between binding affinity and specificity in the mechanism
for searching the amino acid sequence space of antibodies.

This is largely due to interacting pairs which are part of protein complexes.
We solve a generic model of complex formation and show explicitly that
complexes form most efficiently when their members have roughly the same
concentrations. Therefore, the observed similarity in interacting protein
concentrations could be attributed to optimization for efficiency of complex

given fixed entangled state of many qubits and perform computation by applying
a sequence of measurements to designated qubits in designated bases. The choice
of basis for later measurements may depend on earlier measurement outcomes and
the final result of the computation is determined from the classical data of
all the measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the more familiar gate
array model in which computational steps are unitary operations, developing a
large entangled state prior to some final measurements for the output. Two
principal schemes of measurement based computation are teleportation quantum
computation (TQC) and the so-called cluster model or one-way quantum computer
(1WQC). We will describe these schemes and show how they are able to perform
universal quantum computation. We will outline various possible relationships
between the models which serve to clarify their workings. We will also discuss
possible novel computational benefits of the measurement based models compared
to the gate array model, especially issues of parallelisability of algorithms.
