scales are used: barycentric and geocentric coordinate times, TCB and TCG, as
well as two additional time scales, TDB and TT, that are defined as linear
functions of TCB and TCG, respectively.
  The paper is devoted to a concise but still detailed explanation of the
reasons and the implications of the relativistic scalings of astronomical
quantities induced by the time scales TDB and TT.
  We consequently distinguish between quantities and their numerical values
expressed in some units.
  It is argued that the scaled time scales, the scaled spatial coordinates and
the scaled masses should be considered as distinct quantities which themselves
can be expressed in any units, and not as numerical values of the same
quantities expressed in some different, non-SI units (``TDB units'' and ``TT

  Along the same lines of argumentation the system of astronomical units is
discussed in the relativistic framework. The whole freedom in the definitions
of the systems of astronomical units for TCB and TDB is demonstrated. A number
of possible ways to freeze the freedom are shown and discussed. It is argued
that in the future one should think about converting AU into a defined quantity
by fixing its value in SI meters.

to mixing of E polarization into B, which introduces cosmic variance conta-

even in absence of detector noise. We present numerical results for the
uncertainty in the tensor-to-scalar ratio using the Fisher matrix formalism for
various resolutions, using foreground models based on dust maps and assuming 90
GHz operating frequency. We find that the usual scaling delta(T/S) ~
f_sky^(-1/2) is significantly degraded and becomes delta(T/S) ~ f_sky^(-2) for
f_sky>0.7. This dependence is affected only weakly by the choice of sky cuts.
To achieve a T/S=10^(-3) detection at 3 sigma one needs to observe 15% of the

large sky area at required level one must be able to remove polarized dust
emission at or better than 0.1% of unpolarized intensity, assuming the cleanest

one needs to observe 70% of the sky, which is only possible if dust emission is
removed everywhere over this region at 0.01% level. Reaching T/S=10^(-2) should
be easier: 1% of the sky is needed over which polarized emission needs to be

simulations of jets from Keplerian disks whose mass loading as a function of
disk radius is systematically changed. For a reasonable model for the density

determined by the radial structure of the disk's magnetic field structure. We
vary this structure by using four different magnetic field configurations,
ranging from the ""potential"" configuration (Ouyed&Pudritz 1997), to the
increasingly more steeply falling Blandford&Payne (1982) and Pelletier&Pudritz

the mass load has a profound effect on both the rotational profile of the
underlying jet as well as the degree of collimation of its outflow velocity and
magnetic field lines. We show analytically, and confirm by our simulations,
that the collimation of a jet depends on its radial current distribution, which
in turn is prescribed by the mass load. Models with steeply descending mass
loads have strong toroidal fields, and these collimate to cylinders (this
includes the Ouyed-Pudritz and Blandford-Payne outflows). On the other hand,
the more gradually descending mass load profiles (the PP92 and monopolar

outflows with parabolic collimation. We also present detailed structural
information about jets such as their radial profiles of jet density, toroidal
magnetic field, and poloidal jet speed, as well as an analysis of the bulk

M_med=10^11.3 M_sun/h. We also find that the number density of galaxy- and

mass-defined voids for large void radii. As expected, there are outflow
velocities which show their maximum at larger void-centric distances for larger
voids (well described by a linear relation). The void-centric distance where
this maximum occurs, follows a suitable power law fit of the form,
log(d_vmax)=(r_void/A)^B. At sufficiently large distances, we find mild infall
motions onto the sub-dense regions. We find that a similar analysis in redshift

also find that the velocity dispersion of galaxies and haloes is larger in the

black hole (BH) growth, we predict the faint end slope of the quasar luminosity
function (QLF) and its evolution with redshift. Our simulations have yielded a
new model for quasar lifetimes where the lifetime depends on both the
instantaneous and peak quasar luminosities. This motivates a new interpretation
of the QLF in which the bright end consists of quasars radiating at nearly
their peak luminosities, but the faint end is mostly made up of quasars in less
luminous phases of evolution. The faint-end QLF slope is then determined by the
faint-end slope of the quasar lifetime for quasars with peak luminosities near
the observed break. We determine this slope from the quasar lifetime as a
function of peak luminosity, based on a large set of simulations spanning a
wide variety of host galaxy, merger, BH, and ISM gas properties. Brighter peak
luminosity (higher BH mass) systems undergo more violent evolution, and expel
and heat gas more rapidly in the final stages of quasar evolution, resulting in
a flatter faint-end slope (as these objects fall below the observed break in
the QLF more rapidly). Therefore, as the QLF break luminosity moves to higher
luminosities with increasing redshift, implying a larger typical quasar peak
luminosity, the faint-end QLF slope flattens. From the quasar lifetime as a
function of peak luminosity and this interpretation of the QLF, we predict the
faint-end QLF slope and its evolution with redshift in good agreement with
observations. Although BHs grow anti-hierarchically (with lower-mass BHs formed
primarily at lower redshifts), the observed change in slope and differential or
luminosity dependent density evolution in the QLF is completely determined by
the luminosity-dependent quasar lifetime and physics of quasar feedback.

available monitoring data since 1969, in X-rays from Vela 5B, Ariel 5, Ginga,
CGRO and RXTE satellites and in radio from the Ryle and Green Bank telescopes.
We confirm a number of previously obtained results, and, for the first time,
find an orbital modulation at 15 GHz in the soft state and show the detailed
non-sinusoidal shape of that modulation in the hard state of both the 15-GHz
emission and the X-rays from the RXTE/ASM. We find the CGRO/BATSE data are
consistent with the presence of a weak orbital modulation, in agreement with
its theoretical modelling as due to Compton scattering in the companion wind.
We then confirm the presence of a ~150-d superorbital period in all of the data
since ~1976, finding it in particular for the first time in the Ariel 5 data.
Those data sets, covering >65 superorbital cycles, show a remarkable constancy
of both the period and the phase. On the other hand, we confirm the presence of
a ~290-d periodicity in the 1969-1979 Vela 5B data, indicating a switch from
that period to its first harmonic at some time <~1980. We find the superorbital
modulation is compatible with accretion disc precession. Finally, we find a
significant modulation in the RXTE/ASM data at a period of 5.82-d, which
corresponds to the beat between the orbital and superorbital modulations
provided the latter is prograde.

phase mixing such as cold-collapse. A family of polytropes are examined from a

on these models: only polytropes with index $n \sim 5$ with a flat boundary
condition at the center are compatible with the numerical results, except for
the outer region. Using the analytic solutions based on the static and

controlling the phases and tilting angles of the pulse trains, as well as
analytical and numerical calculations allowed us to explain the origin of these

two conditions: i) an rf field inhomogeneity able to produce different tilting
angles in different sites of the sample and ii) the absence of spin diffusion
(non-effective flip-flop interactions). The last requirement is easily
satisfied in diluted dipolar solids, where the frequency differences between
sites, caused by disorder or other sources, are usually at least one order of
magnitude larger than the dipolar couplings. Both conditions lead to the
generation of stimulated echoes in Carr-Purcell (CP) and
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse trains. We show, both experimentally and
theoretically, that the stimulated echoes interfere constructively or
destructively with the normal (Hahn) echoes depending on the alternation or not
of the pi pulse phases in the CP and the CPMG sequences. Constructive
interferences occur for the CP and CPMG sequences with and without phase
alternation respectively, which are the cases where long magnetization tails
are observed. Sequences with two, three and four pi pulses after the pi/2 pulse

is eliminated by a constraint on physical states, which is invariant under the

characteristic timescales of dynamic variables, as in the traditional singular
perturbation approaches. Others appear in a way which makes the standard
approaches inapplicable. We apply this analysis to study the behaviour of
fronts of excitation waves in spatially-extended cardiac models. Suppressing
the excitability of the tissue leads to a decrease in the propagation speed,
but only to a certain limit; further suppression blocks active propagation and
leads to a passive diffusive spread of voltage. Such a dissipation may happen
if a front propagates into a tissue recovering after a previous wave, e.g.
re-entry. A dissipated front does not recover even when the excitability
restores. This has no analogy in FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variants, where
fronts can stop and then start again. In two spatial dimensions, dissipation
accounts for break-ups and self-termination of re-entrant waves in excitable

are confined to specific orbits in the scaled space, yet the uncertainty
principle is maintained because the scaling leaves invariant the
position-momentum commutator. A first-order perturbation correction,
proportional to 1/D, substantially improves the agreement with the exact ground
state potential energy curve. The present treatment is very simple
mathematically, yet provides a strikingly accurate description of the potential
energy curves for the lowest singlet, triplet and excited states of H_2. We

To appear in Neural Computation, 2005",,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  We study both analytically and numerically the effect of presynaptic noise on
the transmission of information in attractor neural networks. The noise occurs
on a very short-time scale compared to that for the neuron dynamics and it
produces short-time synaptic depression. This is inspired in recent
neurobiological findings that show that synaptic strength may either increase
or decrease on a short-time scale depending on presynaptic activity. We thus
describe a mechanism by which fast presynaptic noise enhances the neural
network sensitivity to an external stimulus. The reason for this is that, in
general, the presynaptic noise induces nonequilibrium behavior and,
consequently, the space of fixed points is qualitatively modified in such a way
that the system can easily scape from the attractor. As a result, the model
shows, in addition to pattern recognition, class identification and
categorization, which may be relevant to the understanding of some of the brain
complex tasks.

We consider stochastic models of quantum computation on $n$ qubits subject to
noise operators that are obtained as products of tiny noise operators acting on
a small number of qubits. We conjecture that for realistic random noise
operators of this kind there will be substantial dependencies between the noise
on individual qubits and, in addition, we propose that the dependence structure
of the noise acting on individual qubits will necessarily depend
(systematically) on the dependence structure of the qubits themselves. We point
out that the majority function can repair, in the classical case, some forms of
stochastic noise of this kind and conjecture that this healing power of
majority has no quantum analog. The main hypothesis of this paper is that these
properties of noise are sufficient to reduce quantum computation to
probabilistic classical computation. Some potentially relevant mathematical
issues and problems will be described. Our line of thought appears to be
related to that of physicists Alicki, Horodecki, Horodecki and Horodecki

  detailed cauculation of the ""new"" upper bound 'is presented","Phys. Rev. A 73, 032305 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.032305",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper, a photon-number-resolving decoy state quantum key distribution
scheme is presented based on recent experimental advancements. A new upper
bound on the fraction of counts caused by multiphoton pulses is given. This
upper bound is independent of intensity of the decoy source, so that both the
signal pulses and the decoy pulses can be used to generate the raw key after
verified the security of the communication. This upper bound is also the lower
bound on the fraction of counts caused by multiphoton pulses as long as faint
coherent sources and high lossy channels are used. We show that Eve's coherent
multiphoton pulse (CMP) attack is more efficient than symmetric individual (SI)
attack when quantum bit error rate is small, so that CMP attack should be
considered to ensure the security of the final key. finally, optimal intensity
of laser source is presented which provides 23.9 km increase in the
transmission distance. 03.67.Dd

"quant-ph/0508100","Elem\'er Rosinger","Elemer E Rosinger","Notes on Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  There have lately been a variety of attempts to connect, or even explain, if
not in fact, reduce human consciousness to quantum mechanical processes. Such
attempts tend to draw a sharp and fundamental distinction between the role of
consciousness in classical mechanics, and on the other hand, in quantum
mechanics, with an insistence on the assumed exceptional character of the
latter. What is strangely missed, however, is the role of human consciousness
as such in the very discovery or creation of both of these physical theories.
And this a priori role is far more important than all the possible a posteriori
interplays between consciousness and the mentioned two theories of physics,
interplays which may happen during one or another specific experiment,
measurement, and so on. In this regard it is suggested that the specific
features human consciousness may exhibit during interactions with quantum
mechanical systems may as well have other explanations which do not appear to
be less plausible, or less well founded.
