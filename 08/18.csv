By fitting models for the circumstellar dust distributions simultaneously to
the scattered light images, millimeter continuum data, and the SEDs, we attempt
to distinguish between flared disks, infalling envelopes with outflow cavities,
and combinations of disks and envelopes. For each of these circumstellar
density distributions, we generate grids of models for varying geometries, dust
masses, and accretion rates, and determine the best fits by minimizing the
residuals between model and data. Models incorporating both massive envelopes
and massive embedded disks generally fit the imaging+SED data best. Implied
envelope infall rates for these models are consistent with infall rates derived
by previous investigators, although they are approximately an order of
magnitude larger than inner disk accretion rates inferred from recent
spectroscopic measurements. In addition, the disk masses inferred from our
models are close to or larger than the limit for gravitationally stable disks,
indicating that Class I disks may undergo periodic episodes of enhanced
accretion, perhaps as a result of gravitational instabilities. An important
caveat to these results is that in some cases, no single model can fit all of

determined by the spin temperature T_s, which describes the relative

luminous sources appear, T_s is set by the Wouthuysen-Field effect, in which
Lyman-series photons mix the hyperfine levels. Here we consider coupling
through n>2 Lyman photons. We first show that coupling (and heating) from
scattering of Lyman-n photons is negligible, because they rapidly cascade to
lower-energy photons. These cascades can result in either a Lyman-alpha photon
-- which will then affect T_s according to the usual Wouthuysen-Field mechanism
-- or photons from the 2s -> 1s continuum, which escape without scattering. We
show that a proper treatment of the cascades delays the onset of strong
Wouthuysen-Field coupling and affects the power spectrum of brightness
fluctuations when the overall coupling is still relatively weak (i.e., around
the time of the first stars). Cascades damp fluctuations on small scales
because only ~ 1/3 of Lyn photons cascade through Lyman-alpha, but they do not
affect the large-scale power because that arises from those photons that
redshift directly into the Lyman-alpha transition. We also comment on the
utility of Lyman-n transitions in providing ""standard rulers"" with which to

impact of dark matter halo shapes on the bispectrum. Analytic expressions are
derived and evaluated through numerical integration. Two models for the
ellipsoidal halo profiles are considered: a toy model designed to isolate the
effects of halo shape on the clustering alone; and the realistic model of Jing
& Suto. For equilateral k-space triangles, we show that the predictions of the
triaxial model are suppressed, relative to the spherical model, by roughly ~7%
and ~4% for the two profiles respectively. The reduced bispectrum as a function
of triangle configuration is found to be very sensitive to halo shapes on small
scales. The generic features are that, relative to the spherical model, the
signal is suppressed for k-space triangles that are close to equilateral and
boosted for configurations that are colinear. This appears to be a unique
signature of halo triaxiality.
  The galaxy bispectrum is also explored. Two models for the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) are considered: the binomial distribution of Scoccimarro et
al. and the Poisson satellite model of Kravtsov et al. Our predictions show
that the galaxy bispectrum is also sensitive to halo shapes, although relative
to the mass, the effects are reduced. The HOD of Kravtsov et al. is found to be
more sensitive. This owes to the mean number of galaxies per halo being a
steeper function of mass in this model, hence giving stronger weight to the
high mass (more triaxial) haloes. Interestingly, the functional form is not
strongly sensitive to the details of the HOD, but is mainly determined by the
halo shape. However, a combination of measurements made on different scales and
for different k-space triangles are sensitive to both halo shape and the HOD.

with WMAP team's published power spectrum closely. A small systematic
difference at large multipoles is accounted for by the correction for the
expected residual power from unresolved point sources. The correction is small
and significantly tempered. Previous estimates have depended on foreground

demonstration that the CMB angular spectrum can be reliably estimated with

fluctuation of the rotational velocity. The dependences of the jet velocity
$(v_z)$, mass outflow rate $(\dot{M}_w)$, and mass accretion rate $(\dot{M}_a)$
on the initial magnetic field strength in both non-axisymmetric cases are
similar to those in the axisymmetric case. That is, $v_z \propto B_0^{1/3}$,
$\dot{M}_w \propto B_0$ and $\dot{M}_a \propto B_0^{1.4}$ where $B_0$ is the
initial magnetic field strength. The former two relations are consistent with
the Michel's steady solution, $v_z \propto (B_0^2/\dot{M}_w)^{1/3}$, although
the jet and accretion do not reach the steady state. In both perturbation
cases, a non-axisymmetric structure with $m=2$ appears in the jet, where $m$
means the azimuthal wave number. This structure can not be explained by
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and seems to originate in the accretion disk.

orbital periods of the accretion disk, while all modes in the accretion disk
grow with oscillation. As for the angular momentum transport by Maxwell stress,
the vertical component, $<B_\phi B_z/4\pi>$, is comparable to the radial
component, $<B_\phi B_r/4\pi>$, in the wide range of initial magnetic field

line emission indicating an upper limit for the HI content of the galaxy of ~
10E6 solar masses and providing an upper value for the M(HI)/L(B) ratio equal
to 2.4 solar masses/solar luminosities. The low value of the HI content
suggested by the observations, together with the galaxy optical morphology,
might indicate that APPLES1 is a dwarf spheroidal. This indication is in
contrast with the evidence of recent star formation, which is typical for dwarf
irregular galaxies. This may suggest that APPLES1 belongs to the class of mixed
dwarf irregular/spheroidal transition-type galaxies. We also conclude that the
relatively low neutral gas mass in APPLES1 can be explained by an extended and
inefficient star formation process, without the need for a dramatic event such
as enhanced star formation or a past encounter with a massive galaxy or galaxy

obtained at higher radio frequencies. However, with respect to the afterglow
model, some additional flux at the lower frequencies is present when these

1/T1 is found to depend on the coupling with the diluted rare-earth (RE)
moments. Depending on the temperature range, a fast spin diffusion regime or a
diffusion limited regime is encountered. In both cases we find it possible to
use the 19F nucleus as a probe of the rare-earth spin dynamics. The results for
1/T1 show a behavior similar to that observed in molecular nanomagnets, a
result which we attribute to the discreteness of the energy levels in both
cases. At intermediate temperatures the lifetime broadening of the crystal
field split RE magnetic levels follows a T3 power law. At low temperature the
field dependence of 1/T1 shows peaks in correspondence to the critical magnetic
fields for energy level crossings (LC). The results can be explained by
inelastic scattering between the fluorine nuclear spins and the RE magnetic
levels. A key result of this study is that the broadening of the levels at LC
is found to be become extremely small at low temperatures, about 1.7 mT, a
value which is comparable to the weak dipolar fields at the RE lattice
positions. Thus, unlike the molecular magnets, decoherence effects are strongly
suppressed, and it may be possible to measure directly the level repulsions at
avoided level crossings.

with most crystalline solids. We show that such a feature is a necessary
consequence of the weak connectivity of the solid, and that the frequency of
modes in excess is very sensitive to the pressure. We analyze in particular two
systems whose density D(w) of vibrational modes of angular frequency w display
scaling behaviors with the packing fraction: (i) simulations of jammed packings
of particles interacting through finite-range, purely repulsive potentials,
comprised of weakly compressed spheres at zero temperature and (ii) a system
with the same network of contacts, but where the force between any particles in
contact (and therefore the total pressure) is set to zero. We account in the
two cases for the observed a) convergence of D(w) toward a non-zero constant as
w goes to 0, b) appearance of a low-frequency cutoff w*, and c) power-law
increase of w* with compression. Differences between these two systems occur at
lower frequency. The density of states of the modified system displays an
abrupt plateau that appears at w*, below which we expect the system to behave
as a normal, continuous, elastic body. In the unmodified system, the pressure
lowers the frequency of the modes in excess. The requirement of stability
despite the destabilizing effect of pressure yields a lower bound on the number

suppression, taking the thoeretical estimates well below the data. Two
additional arguments are presented which may decrease the theoretical estimate
further. The calculations are more sensitive to the assumptions made in
evaluating the hadronic scattering amplitude than in the processes considered
previously and lattice gauge calculations indicate that the odderon intercept
may be appreciably lower than usually assumed. These two latter effects are
particularly relevant for the reactions gamma p --> f2(1270)X and gamma p -->

Equivalent representations of a discrete connection are considered, and an

order of approximation, are also addressed. Discrete connections provide an
intrinsic method for introducing coordinates on the reduced space for discrete

shell-model calculations in evaluations of the spectral distributions of
certain operators. This technique is of great value because the alternative, a
state-by-state summation over final states, is generally not feasible. The most
celebrated application is to the Gamow-Teller operator, which governs beta
decay and neutrino reactions in the allowed limit. The Lanczos procedure
determines the nuclear response along a line q=0 in the (omega,q) plane, where
omega and q are the energy and three-momentum transfered to the nucleus.
However, generalizing such treatments from the allowed limit to general
electroweak response functions at arbitrary momentum transfers seems
considerably more difficult: the response function must be determined over the
entire (omega,q) plane for an operator O(q) that is not fixed, but depends
explicitly on q. Such operators arise in any semileptonic process where the
momentum transfer is comparable to (or larger than) the inverse nuclear size.
Here we show, for Slater determinants built on harmonic oscillator basis
functions, that the nuclear response for any multipole operator O(q) can be
determined efficiently over the full response plane by a generalization of the
standard Lanczos moments method. We describe the Piecewise Moments Method and
thoroughly explore its convergence properties for the test case of
electromagnetic responses in a full sd-shell calculation of 28Si. We discuss
possible extensions to a variety of electroweak processes, including charged-
and neutral-current neutrino scattering.

coarse-grained quantities of interest, such as mesoscopic transport
coefficients. In particular, using a simple model of a genetic toggle switch,
we illustrate the computation of an effective free energy and of a
state-dependent effective diffusion coefficient that characterize an
unavailable effective Fokker-Planck equation. Additionally we illustrate the
linking of equation-free techniques with continuation methods for performing a
form of stochastic ""bifurcation analysis""; estimation of mean switching times
in the case of a bistable switch is also implemented in this equation-free

long-time stochastic simulations. This type of equation-free analysis appears
to be a promising approach to computing features of the long-time,
coarse-grained behavior of certain classes of complex stochastic models of gene

removing the observer from the description in order to guarantee {\em

other confused subject areas. {\em Emergence} is a topic about which much ink
has been spilt, but it can be understand easily as an irreducibility between
description space and meaning space. Quantum Mechanics can also be understood
as a theory of observation. The success in explaining quantum mechanics, leads
one to conjecture that all of physics may be reducible to properties of the
observer. And indeed, what are the necessary (as opposed to contingent)
properties of an observer? This requires a full theory of consciousness, from
which we are a long way from obtaining. However where progress does appear to
