CO(4--3), CO(5--4) and CO(6--5) lines in the gravitational lensed submm galaxy
SMM J16359+6612 at z=2.5. The CO lines have a double peak profile in all
transitions. From a Gaussian decomposition of the spectra we show that the CO
line ratios, and therefore the underlying physical conditions of the gas, are
similar for the blue and the redshifted component. The CO line Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED; i.e. flux density vs. rotational quantum number) turns over
already at the CO(5--4) transition which shows that the molecular gas is less
excited than in nearby starburst galaxies and high--z QSOs. This difference
mainly arises from a lower average H2 density, which indicates that the gas is
less centrally concentrated than in nuclear starburst regions in local
galaxies. We suggest that the bulk of the molecular gas in SMM J16359+6612 may
arise from an overlap region of two merging galaxies. The low gas density and
clear velocity separation may reflect an evolutionary stage of the merger event
that is in between those seen in the Antennae and in the more evolved
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) like e.g. Mrk231.

the kinetic temperature of the dark matter in the halo so as to produce
acceptable central electron densities. We ascribe this hotter plasma
temperature to the addition of entropy prior to and during assembly of the

longer than the gravitational collapse time but, in the inner parts, shorter
than the Hubble time, making the corona thermally unstable to the formation of
a cloudy structure that may be in line with what is indicated by quasar
absorption line systems. The corona of an isolated spiral galaxy would be a
source of soft X-ray and recombination radiation, adding to the more commonly
discussed effects of stars and supernovae. In this picture the mass in the
corona is much larger than the mass in condensed baryons in a spiral galaxy.
The corona thus would be a substantial reservoir of diffuse baryons that are
settling and adding to the mass in interstellar matter and stars, so that star
formation in isolated spirals will continue well beyond the present epoch.

this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity

drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end
of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive
galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain
systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs
because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and
radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback)
can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star
formation. We discuss possible physical models which might explain the
accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to
be successful.

using related methods. In particular, the planes of the quadrupole and the
octopole are unexpectedly aligned. Moreover, the combined quadrupole plus
octopole is surprisingly aligned with the geometry and direction of motion of
the solar system: the plane they define is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane
and to the plane defined by the dipole direction, and the ecliptic plane
carefully separates stronger from weaker extrema, running within a couple of
degrees of the null-contour between a maximum and a minimum over more than
120deg of the sky. Even given the alignment of the quadrupole and octopole with
each other, we find that their alignment with the ecliptic is unlikely at >98%
C.L., and argue that it is in fact unlikely at >99.9% C.L. We explore the role
of foregrounds showing that the known Galactic foregrounds are unlikely to lead
to these correlations. Multipole vectors, like individual a_lm, are very
sensitive to sky cuts, and we demonstrate that analyses using cut skies induce
relatively large errors, thus weakening the observed correlations but
preserving their consistency with the full-sky results. Finally we apply our
tests to COBE cut-sky maps and briefly extend the analysis to higher
multipoles. If the correlations we observe are indeed a signal of non-cosmic
origin, then the lack of low-l power will very likely be exacerbated, with
important consequences for our understanding of cosmology on large scales.

For masses <5 10^11 M_sh^-1, halos in clusters are on average ~30-40% more

When comparing only parent halos, the differences are less pronounced but they

Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) of the Io plasma torus, we show
remarkable, though subtle, spatio-temporal variations in torus properties. The
Io torus is found to exhibit significant, near-sinusoidal variations in ion
composition as a function of azimuthal position. The azimuthal variation in
composition is such that the mixing ratio of S II is strongly correlated with
the mixing ratio of S III and the equatorial electron density and strongly
anti-correlated with the mixing ratios of both S IV and O II and the equatorial
electron temperature. Surprisingly, the azimuthal variation in ion composition
is observed to have a period of 10.07 hours--1.5% longer than the System III
rotation period of Jupiter, yet 1.3% shorter than the System IV period defined
by Brown (1995). Although the amplitude of the azimuthal variation of S III and
O II remained in the range of 2-5%, the amplitude of the S II and S IV
compositional variation ranged between 5-25% during the UVIS observations.
Furthermore, the amplitude of the azimuthal variations of S II and S IV appears
to be modulated by its location in System III longitude, such that when the
region of maximum S II mixing ratio (minimum S IV mixing ratio) is aligned with
a System III longitude of ~200 +/- 15 degrees, the amplitude is a factor of ~4
greater than when the variation is anti-aligned. This behavior can explain
numerous, often apparently contradictory, observations of variations in the
properties of the Io plasma torus with the System III and System IV coordinate
systems.

pulsation equation that relates temperature to period, luminosity, and mass.
Modern data for the correlations between period, luminosity, and metallicity at
the FBE for field and cluster RRL are used for the temperature calculation. The
predicted temperatures are changed to B-V colors using an adopted color
transformation. The predicted temperatures at the FBE become hotter as [Fe/H]
changes from 0 to -1.5, and thereafter cooler as the metallicity decreases to
-2.5 and beyond. The temperature range over this interval of metallicity is
$\Delta$log $T_e$ = 0.04, or 640 K at 6900K. The predicted color variation is
at the level of 0.03 mag in B-V. The predictions are compared with the observed
RRL colors at the FBE for both the field and cluster variables, showing general
agreement at the level of 0.02 mag in (B-V)$_o$, which, however, is the
uncertainty of the reddening corrections.

measure the broadband power spectral density functions (PSDs) of two Seyfert
galaxies, the broad line Seyfert 1 NGC 3227 and the Seyfert 2 NGC 5506, which
has recently been identified as an obscured Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS 1).
Using a Monte-Carlo fitting technique we demonstrate that both PSDs are
reminiscent of the PSD of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft
state, and specifically rule out a low/hard state PSD shape in NGC 3227. This
result demonstrates that, at least where variability is concerned, broad line
Seyferts with hard X-ray spectra (photon index~1.6) are not simply the
analogues of the low/hard state in BHXRBs, and the dichotomy of NLS 1 and broad
line Seyferts cannot be simply interpreted in terms of the two states. We show
that the PSD normalisation in NGC 3227 is strongly energy dependent, with
larger variability amplitudes at lower energies, unlike NGC 5506 which shows
little energy-dependence of variability. We demonstrate that this difference is
caused by spectral pivoting of the continuum in NGC 3227 at high energies,
which is probably also related to the large amplitude of variability seen in
the 2-10 keV band in this AGN. Using the new PSD data and new results in the
literature, we replot the PSD break time-scale versus mass plot for all AGN
with PSD breaks measured so far, and demonstrate that higher accretion-rate AGN
appear to have relatively shorter break time-scales for their black hole mass
than lower-accretion rate AGN.

is very highly polarized (up to 79%). Such high levels of polarization implies
a distribution of dust grains lacking large grains, contrary to the usual dust
models of dark clouds. We discuss the geometry of the dust distribution giving
rise to the bipolar reflection nebulosity and make mass estimates for the

other high redshift samples. We perform both qualitative and quantitative
analyses by categorizing the galaxies according to their visual properties, and
by examining their surface brightness profiles. We find that all of the
galaxies have approximately exponential profiles, indicative of galactic disks,
and have a median scale length of about 1.7 kpc. Inspection of the visual
morphologies reveals a high fraction of merging and interacting systems, with
\~30% showing clear signs of interaction, and an additional ~30% exhibiting
irregular and asymmetric structure which may be the result of recent mergers;
these fractions are independent of redshift and galaxy luminosity. On the other
hand, the three GRB host galaxies for which submillimeter and radio emission
has been detected are isolated and compact, unlike the luminous
submillimeter-selected galaxies. The fraction of mergers appears to be elevated
compared to other high redshift samples, particularly for the low luminosities
of GRB hosts (M_B ~ -16 to -21 mag). This suggests that merging and interacting
galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation may be an efficient site for the
production of GRB progenitors. Finally, we show that GRB hosts clearly follow
the size-luminosity relation present in other galaxy samples, but thanks to
absorption redshifts they help extend this relation to lower luminosities.

most (if not all) quasars with a small covering factor. Recent works showed
that the BALR is optically thick to soft and even medium energy X-rays, with a
typical hydrogen column density of a few 10$^{23}$ to $>$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$.
The electron scattering in the thick absorber might contribute significantly to
the observed continuum polarization for both BAL QSOs and non-BAL QSOs. In this
paper, we present a detailed study of the electron scattering in the BALR by
assuming an equatorial and axisymmetric outflow model. Monte-Carlo simulations
are performed to correct the effect of the radiative transfer. Assuming an
average covering factor of 0.2 of the BALR, which is consistent with
observations, we find the electron scattering in the BALR with a column density
of $\sim$ 4 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ can successfully produce the observed
average continuum polarization for both BAL QSOs and non-BAL QSOs. The observed
distribution of the continuum polarization of radio quiet quasars (for both BAL
QSOs and non-BAL QSOs) is used to constrain the dispersal distribution of the
BALR. We find that, to match the observations, the maximum continuum
polarization produced by the BALR (while viewed edge-on) peaks at $P$ = 0.34%,
which is much smaller than the average continuum polarization of BAL QSOs ($P$
= 0.93%). The discrepancy can be explained by a selection bias that the BAL
with larger covering factor, and thus producing larger continuum polarization,
is more likely to be detected. A larger sample of radio quiet quasars with
accurate measurement of the continuum polarization will give better constraints
to the distribution of the BALR properties.

softening following the giant flare is caused by the increase of the relative

  When compared for individual disks, the HI column density and dust opacity do
not seem to be correlated as HI and opacity follow different radial profiles.
  To improve statistics, an average radial opacity profile is compared to an
average HI profile. Compared to dust-to-HI estimates from the literature, more
extinction is found in this profile. This difference may be accounted for by an
underestimate of the dust in earlier measurements due to their dependence on
dust temperature. Since the SFM is insensitive to the dust temperature, the
ratio between the SFM opacity and HI could very well be indicative of the true
ratio.
  Earlier claims for a radially extended cold dust disk were based on sub-mm
observations. A comparison between sub-mm observations and counts of distant
galaxies is therefore desirable. We present the best current example of such a
comparison, M51, for which the measurements seem to agree. However, this

stochastic forcing. The fuel consists of carbon and oxygen in a state which is
encountered in white dwarfs close to the Chandrasekhar limit. The level set
method is applied to represent the flame fronts numerically. The computational
domain for the numerical simulations is cubic, and periodic boundary conditions
are imposed. The goal is the development of a suitable flame speed model for
the small-scale dynamics of turbulent deflagration in thermonuclear supernovae.
Because the burning process in a supernova explosion is transient and spatially
inhomogeneous, the localised determination of subgrid scale closure parameters
is essential. We formulate a semi-localised model based on the dynamical
equation for the subgrid scale turbulence energy $k_{\mathrm{sgs}}$. The
turbulent flame speed $s_{\mathrm{t}}$ is of the order
$\sqrt{2k_{\mathrm{sgs}}}$. In particular, the subgrid scale model features a
dynamic procedure for the calculation of the turbulent energy transfer from
resolved toward subgrid scales, which has been successfully applied to
combustion problems in engineering. The options of either including or
suppressing inverse energy transfer in the turbulence production term are
compared. In combination with the piece-wise parabolic method for the
hydrodynamics, our results favour the latter option. Moreover, different
choices for the constant of proportionality in the asymptotic flame speed

to calibrate numbers of distant galaxies as a probe of extinction in a
foreground spiral disk. Gonzalez et al. (2003) studied the effect of the
foreground disk on these numbers using simulations of current and future
instruments for fields in the LMC, M31 and NGC 4536, a galaxy in Virgo. They
concluded that: (1) the brighter centers of disks were unsuitable, (2) the
granularity of the disk at a fixed surface brightness is the limiting factor in
the detection of distant galaxies, and (3) the optimum distance for
measurements would be that of the Virgo cluster for the current instruments on
board HST. At this distance the foreground disk is smoothed with distance,
improving detection of distant background galaxies. Holwerda et al. (2005a)
automated the SFM and Holwerda et al. (2005b) applied it to a large set of
WFPC2 fields. In this paper, the quality of the extinction measurement in these
fields is compared to their distance, granularity, surface brightness and
structure. The average surface brightness of the of a field is shown to
directly influence the accuracy of the SFM. This restricts meaningful
measurements to the disks of spiral galaxies. Large structures such as spiral
arms have a similar effect. The granularity or small scale structure in a field
influences the detection of distant galaxies, limiting the SFM measurements in
nearby disks. From the trends in the accuracy and maximum practical
field-of-view considerations, the minimum and maximum distance for SFM
application, approximately 5 and 35 Mpc respectively. Using the same instrument
and detection method, the relations with SFM parameters and field
characteristics can be used to forgo the synthetic fields altogether.

resulting from collisions of highly charged iron with N2 gas at an energy of 10
eV/amu in an electron beam ion trap. Although individual high-n emission lines
are not resolved in our measurements, we observe that the most likely level for
Fe25+ --> Fe24+ electron capture is n~9, in line with expectations, while the
most likely value for Fe26+ --> Fe25+ charge exchange is significantly higher.
In the Fe XXV spectrum, the K-alpha emission feature dominates, whether
produced via charge exchange or collisional excitation. The K-alpha centroid is
lower in energy for the former case than the latter (6666 versus 6685 eV,
respectively), as expected because of the strong enhancement of emission from
the forbidden and intercombination lines, relative to the resonance line, in
charge-exchange spectra. In contrast, the Fe XXVI high-n Lyman lines have a
summed intensity greater than that of Ly-alpha, and are substantially stronger
than predicted from theoretical calculations of charge exchange with atomic H.
We conclude that the angular momentum distribution resulting from electron
capture using a multi-electron target gas is significantly different from that
obtained with H, resulting in the observed high-n enhancement. A discussion is
presented of the relevance of our results to studies of diffuse Fe emission in
the Galactic Center and Galactic Ridge, particularly with ASTRO-E2/Suzaku.

collected from four major university campuses are analyzed with the aim of
developing fundamental understanding of realistic user behavior in wireless
networks. Both individual user and inter-node (group) behaviors are
investigated and two classes of metrics are devised to capture the underlying
structure of such behaviors.
  For individual user behavior we observe distinct patterns in which most users
are 'on' for a small fraction of the time, the number of access points visited
is very small and the overall on-line user mobility is quite low. We clearly
identify categories of heavy and light users. In general, users exhibit high
degree of similarity over days and weeks.
  For group behavior, we define metrics for encounter patterns and friendship.
Surprisingly, we find that a user, on average, encounters less than 6% of the
network user population within a month, and that encounter and friendship
relations are highly asymmetric. We establish that number of encounters follows
a biPareto distribution, while friendship indexes follow an exponential
distribution. We capture the encounter graph using a small world model, the
characteristics of which reach steady state after only one day.
  We hope for our study to have a great impact on realistic modeling of network
usage and mobility patterns in wireless networks.

problems in wireless networks due to limited network and host resources.
Attacker traceback is a promising solution to take a proper countermeasure near
the attack origins, to discourage attackers from launching attacks, and for
forensics. However, attacker traceback in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) is a
challenging problem due to the dynamic topology, and limited network resources.
It is especially difficult to trace back attacker(s) when they are moving to
avoid traceback. In this paper, we introduce the ATTENTION protocol framework,
which pays special attention to MAC layer abnormal activity under attack.
ATTENTION consists of three classes, namely, coarse-grained traceback,
fine-grained traceback and spatio-temporal fusion architecture. For
energy-efficient attacker searching in MANETs, we also utilize small-world
model. Our simulation analysis shows 79% of success rate in DoS attacker
traceback with coarse-grained attack signature. In addition, with fine-grained
attack signature, it shows 97% of success rate in DoS attacker traceback and
83% of success rate in DDoS attacker traceback. We also show that ATTENTION has
robustness against node collusion and mobility.

algorithms to attain optimal rate-reliability tradeoff, with an interpretation
that each user provides its willingness to pay for reliability to the network

be globally optimal for codes with sufficiently large codeword lengths and user

role played by the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation function for the

contributions: intrinsic and induced fluctuations. We show that traditional
criteria on the stability of semiclassical gravity are incomplete because these
criteria based on the linearized semiclassical Einstein equation can only
provide information on the expectation value and the intrinsic fluctuations of
the metric perturbations. By contrast, the framework of stochastic
semiclassical gravity provides a more complete and accurate criterion because
it contains information on the induced fluctuations as well. The
Einstein-Langevin equation therein contains a stochastic source characterized
by the noise kernel (the symmetrized two-point quantum correlation function of
the stress tensor operator) and yields stochastic correlation functions for the
metric perturbations which agree, to leading order in the large N limit, with
the quantum correlation functions of the theory of gravity interacting with N
matter fields. These points are illustrated with the example of Minkowski
spacetime as a solution to the semiclassical Einstein equation, which is found
to be stable under both intrinsic and induced fluctuations.

which are independent of gluons to provide strong interactions between quarks.
In the original MIT bag model, only interaction mediated by gluon exchanges was
considered, by contrast, in this work we take into account the interaction
mediated by the exchanges of chiral bosons $\sigma$ and $\pi^{(\pm,0)}$. Then
following the standard approach, we minimize the effective hamiltonian which
includes both the contributions from gluon and chiral-boson exchanges with
respect to the bag radius to obtain the effective radius. By re-fitting the
spectra of baryons, we find that the contributions from the boson-exchange may
be 40% of that from gluon-exchanges and meanwhile the bag constant $B$, the
zero-point energy $z_0$ almost do not change. It indicates that in the original
version of the MIT bag model, the intermediate-distance interaction due to the
chiral-boson exchanges is attributed into the effective coupling $\alpha_c$

the subsequent renormalization group evolution of $m_H^2$ down to TeV scale,
thereby the model can naturally realize the little hierarchy $m_H^2\sim
m_{SUSY}^2/8\pi^2$ which is desirable for the lightest Higgs boson mass to
satisfy the experimental bound. In such models, the other Higgs mass parameters
$\mu$ and $B$ can have the desirable size $\mu \sim B \sim m_H$ without severe
fine-tuning of parameters, although the gravitino is much heavier than the

the interaction deduced from lattice studies is strong enough to support
multiple binary bound states. This work is the first variational study of {\em

perturbations are due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton, then P(Q) tends
to have an exponential dependence on Q, due to the fact that in such models Q
is correlated with the amount of inflationary expansion. For simple models with
a power-law potential, P(Q) is peaked at very small values of Q, far smaller
than the observed value of 10^{-5}. This problem does not arise in

umbrella. These are the basic examples, because they correspond to stable germs
of functions in the study of germs of functions with non-isolated

hypersurface singularity at the origin, which in the appropriate sense, has
finite codimension in the set of such germs, the singularity type of such germs

involves the use of an incidence variety which may be useful for studying germs
of finite codimension. The calculation shows that the set of symmetric matrices

singularity with a Whitney stratification (given by the rank of the matrices)
in which only one singular stratum gives a component of top dimension of the
singular set of the conormal.

reconstructions of the $N$-soliton by inverse scattering (numerical linear
algebra) for N=5, 10, 20, and 40. We then recast the inverse-scattering problem
as a Riemann-Hilbert problem and provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of this
problem in the large-N limit. For those $(x,t)$ where results have been
obtained by other authors, we improve the error estimates from $O(N^{-1/3})$ to
$O(N^{-1})$. We also analyze the Fourier power spectrum in this regime and
relate the results to the optical phenomenon of supercontinuum generation. We
then study the $N$-soliton for values of $(x,t)$ where analysis has not been

which turns out to differ from the mechanism that generates the primary
caustic. The mechanism for the generation of the secondary caustic depends
essentially on the discrete nature of the spectrum for the $N$-soliton, and
more significantly, cannot be recovered from an analysis of an ostensibly

Values for masses of 604 neutron-deficient nuclides (30<=Z<=92) were obtained
with a typical uncertainty of 30 microunits. The masses of 114 nuclides were
determined for the first time. The odd-even staggering (OES) of nuclear masses
was systematically investigated for isotopic chains between the proton shell
closures at Z=50 and Z=82. The results were compared with predictions of modern
nuclear models. The comparison revealed that the measured trend of OES is not
reproduced by the theories fitted to masses only. The spectral pairing gaps
extracted from models adjusted to both masses, and density related observables
of nuclei agree better with the experimental data.

our results reveal that in modern parameterizations including SLy4, SkO, SkXc,

along the interfaces are called the ""spring-mass conditions"". By tuning the
stiffness and mass values, it is possible to model various degrees of contact,
from perfect bonding to stress-free surfaces. The conservation laws satisfied
outside the interfaces are integrated using classical finite-difference
schemes. The key problem arising here is how to discretize the spring-mass

pulses in a nonflowing gas, contained in a cylindrical chamber. The laser beam
passed through the chamber along its axis via pinholes in the chamber walls. A
plasma channel with an electron density on the order of 10^18 - 10^19 cm-3 was
formed in pure He, N2, Ar, and Xe. A uniform channel forms at proper time
delays and in optimal pressure ranges, which depend on the sort of gas. The
influence of the interaction of the laser beam with the gas leaking out of the
chamber through the pinholes was found insignificant. However, the formation of
an ablative plasma on the walls of the pinholes by the wings of the radial

formation and its uniformity. A low current glow discharge initiated in the

not allow for superluminal signaling and predict the violation of Bell
inequalities. Intrinsic randomness, uncertainty due to the incompatibility of
two observables, monogamy of correlations, impossibility of perfect cloning,
privacy of correlations, bounds in the shareability of some states; all these
phenomena are solely a consequence of the no-signaling principle and
nonlocality. In particular, it is shown that for any distribution, the
properties of (i) nonlocal, (ii) no arbitrarily shareable and (iii) positive
secrecy content are equivalent.

disordered Ising Hamiltonian (spin glasses), which can be implemented with a
Bose-Fermi (Bose-Bose) mixture in a disordered optical lattice. The second
model we address here is a long range disordered Hamiltonian, characteristic of
neural networks (Hopfield model), which can be implemented in a chain of
trapped ions with appropriately designed interactions.

The density matrix of a graph is the combinatorial laplacian of the graph
normalized to have unit trace. We describe a simple combinatorial condition
(the ""degree condition"") to test separability of density matrices of graphs.
The condition is directly related to the PPT-criterion. We prove that the
degree condition is necessary for separability and we conjecture that it is
also sufficient. We prove special cases of the conjecture involving nearest
point graphs and perfect matchings. We observe that the degree condition
appears to have value beyond density matrices of graphs. In fact, we point out
that circulant density matrices and other matrices constructed from groups
always satisfy the condition and indeed are separable with respect to any
split. The paper isolates a number of problems and delineates further
generalizations.
