Kamiokande II (KII) and Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) experiments. For the
time-integrated flux we assume a quasi-thermal spectrum of the form
$(E/E_0)^\alpha e^{-(\alpha+1)E/E_0}$ where $\alpha$ plays the role of a
spectral index. This simple representation not only allows one to fit the total
energy $E_{\rm tot}$ emitted in $\bar\nu_e$ and the average energy
$<E_{\bar\nu_e}>$, but also accommodates a wide range of shapes, notably
anti-pinched spectra that are broader than a thermal distribution. We find that
the pile-up of low-energy events near threshold in KII forces the best-fit
value for $\alpha$ to the lowest value of any assumed prior range. This applies
to the KII events alone as well as to a common analysis of the two data sets.
The preference of the data for an ``unphysical'' spectral shape implies that
one can extract meaningful values for $<E_{\bar\nu_e}>$ and $E_{\rm tot}$ only
if one fixes a prior value for $\alpha$. The tension between the KII and IMB
data sets and theoretical expectations for $<E_{\bar\nu_e}>$ is not resolved by
an anti-pinched spectrum.

the feature could be identified with a blend of FeXXV and FeXXVI lines, with an
outflow velocity v \approx (0.09-0.26)c. This spectrum is also characterized by
a substantial reduction of the absorption column density and the covering

one-dimensional simulations, that this two-phase accretion leads to CDM halos

accretion history that influence the final profile. Assuming that the

Slow accretion onto an established potential well leads to an outer profile

of mass that is accreted during the fast accretion phase. Using an ensemble of
realistic mass accretion histories, we show that the model predictions of the
dependence of halo concentration on halo formation time, and hence the
dependence of halo concentration on halo mass, and the distribution of halo

stars (DNS) in our galaxy enough so that observable trends in their properties
are starting to emerge. In particular, it has been noted that the majority of
DNS have eccentricities less than 0.3, which are surprisingly low for binaries
that survive a supernova explosion that we believe imparts a significant kick
to the neutron star. To investigate this trend, we generate many different
theoretical distributions of DNS eccentricities using Monte Carlo population
synthesis methods. We determine which eccentricity distributions are most
consistent with the observed sample of DNS binaries. In agreement with
Chaurasia & Bailes (2005), assuming all double neutron stars are equally as
probable to be discovered as binary pulsars, we find that highly eccentric,
coalescing DNS are less likely to be observed because of their accelerated
orbital evolution due to gravitational wave emission and possible early
mergers. Based on our results for coalescing DNS, we also find that models with
vanishingly or moderately small kicks (sigma < about 50 km/s) are inconsistent
with the current observed sample of such DNS. We discuss the implications of
our conclusions for DNS merger rate estimates of interest to ground-based
gravitational-wave interferometers. We find that, although orbital evolution
due to gravitational radiation affects the eccentricity distribution of the
observed sample, the associated upwards correction factor to merger rate
estimates is rather small (typically 10-40%).

the largest possible neutralino masses and pair annihilation cross sections in
supersymmetric models. Extending the parameter space of minimal models, such as
the mSUGRA and the mAMSB scenarios, to general soft SUSY breaking Higgs masses
gives access to the largest possible pair annihilation rates, corresponding to
resonantly annihilating neutralinos with maximal gaugino-higgsino mixing.
Adopting a model-independent approach, we provide analytical and numerical
upper limits for the neutralino pair annihilation cross section. A possible

inclusion of QCD effects in gluino (co-)annihilations can, in extreme
scenarios, make neutralinos with masses in the hundreds of TeV range, well
beyond the s-wave unitarity bound, viable dark matter candidates. Finally, we
outline the ranges of neutralino masses and cross sections for models thermally

upper limit on the number of orphan gamma-ray burst (GRB) radio afterglows, and
thus a lower limit on the typical GRB beaming factor. Here we report radio and
optical follow-up observations of these possible transients, achieving the
first full characterization of the transient radio sky. We find that only two
source are likely to be real radio transients, an optically obscured radio
supernova (SN) in the nearby galaxy NGC 4216, and a source not associated with
a bright host galaxy, which is too radio luminous to be a GRB afterglow. We
speculate that this may be a flare from a peculiar active galactic nucleus, or
a burst from an unusual Galactic compact object. We place an upper limit of 65
radio transients above 6 mJy over the entire sky at the 95% confidence level.
The implications are as follows. First, we derive a limit on the typical
beaming of GRBs; we find f_b^{-1} >~ 60, ~5 times higher than our earlier
results. Second, we impose an upper limit on the rate of events that eject >~
10^{51} erg in unconfined relativistic ejecta, whether or not accompanied by
detectable emission in wavebands other than the radio. Our estimated rate,
<=1000/y/Gpc, is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of
core-collapse SNe (and type Ib/c events in particular), indicating that only a
minority of such events eject significant amounts of relativistic material,
which are required by fireball models of long-soft GRBs. Finally, we show that
future wider and/or deeper radio variability surveys are expected to detect
numerous orphan radio GRB afterglows. Our survey also illustrates the great
potential of sensitive surveys with new instruments to revolutionize the study
of nearby SNe (abridged).

find that the outer edge of a gap is brighter in the scattered light images
than a similar location in a gap-free disk. The stellar radiation that would
have been scattered by material within in the gap is instead scattered by the
disk wall at the outer edge of the gap, producing a bright ring surrounding the
dark gap in the images. Given sufficient resolution, such gaps can be detected
by the presence of this bright ring in scattered light images. A gap in a disk
also changes the shape of the SED. Radiation that would have been absorbed by
material in the gap is instead reprocessed by the outer gap wall. This leads to
a decrease in the SED at wavelengths corresponding to the temperature at the
radius of the missing gap material and a corresponding flux increase at longer
wavelengths corresponding to the temperature of the outer wall. We note that,
unlike an inner hole in the disk, the presence of an annular gap does not
change the bolometric IR flux; it simply redistributes the radiation,
previously produced by material within the gap, to longer wavelengths. This
implies that the changes in the SED generally will be smaller for gaps than
holes. Although it will be difficult on the basis of the SED alone to
distinguish between the presence of a gap and other physical effects, the level
of changes can be sufficiently large to be measurable with current instruments
(e.g., Spitzer).

examine properties on both kiloparsec scales with SAURON, and scales of 100's

kinematically distinct components (KDCs), differing primarily in their
intrinsic sizes. In previous studies, KDCs and their host galaxies have
generally been found to be unremarkable in other aspects. We show that large
KDCs, typical of the well-studied cases, indeed show little or no age
differences with their host galaxy. The KDCs detected with the higher
spatial-resolution of OASIS are intrinsically smaller and include, in contrast,
a significant fraction of young stars. We speculate on the relationship between

the power 1/3. An immediate application of this result is that the tidal field
and tidal truncation radii of million-star globular clusters and million-star
dwarf galaxies (e.g., the Milky Way satellites NGC2419 and Carina) would be
very similar because of the one-to-one relation between gravity and baryon
distribution. This prediction appears, however, inconsistent with the fact that

X-ray Compton backscattering in the photosphere (photospheric albedo) has been

distribution has been analysed using both forward fitting and model independent
inversion methods of spectral analysis. We show that the contribution of the

the Halpha emission and hard X-ray sources with respect to the current-free
extrapolation of the MDI photospheric magnetic field and the characteristics of

field structure and the flare process in low altitude magnetic loops. In
agreement with the predictions of some solar flare models, the hard X-ray
sources are located on the external edges of the Halpha emission and show
chromospheric plasma heated by the non-thermal electrons. The fast changes of
Halpha intensities are located not only inside the hard X-ray sources, as

remnant with a small interstellar gas cloud like the ones observed in the
Cygnus loop and in the Vela SNR. We investigate the interplay between radiative
cooling and thermal conduction during cloud evolution and their effect on the
mass and energy exchange between the cloud and the surrounding medium. Through
the study of two cases characterized by different Mach numbers of the primary
shock (M = 30 and 50, corresponding to a post-shock temperature $T\approx
1.7\times 10^6$ K and $\approx 4.7\times 10^6$ K, respectively), we explore two
very different physical regimes: for M = 30, the radiative losses dominate the
evolution of the shocked cloud which fragments into cold, dense, and compact
filaments surrounded by a hot corona which is ablated by the thermal
conduction; instead, for M = 50, the thermal conduction dominates the evolution
of the shocked cloud, which evaporates in a few dynamical time-scales. In both
cases we find that the thermal conduction is very effective in suppressing the
hydrodynamic instabilities that would develop at the cloud boundaries.

dynamical events perturb the gravitational equilibrium of the gas reservoir in
the hosts, and trigger recurrent accretion episodes controlled by energy
feedback from the very source emission onto the surrounding gas. Depletion of
the latter by these events (adding to quiescent star formation) concurs with
the slowing down of the clustering to cause a fast drop of the activity in
dense regions. Meanwhile, in the ""field"" later and rarer events are triggered
by interactions of still gas-rich galaxies, and eventually by captures of dwarf
satellite galaxies; these are also included in our analytic model. Thus we
compute the quasar and AGN luminosity functions; we find these to brighten and
rise from z ~ 6 to z ~ 2.5, and then toward z ~ 0 to dim and fall somewhat, in
detailed agreement with the observations. We predict that for z < 2.5 the mass
distribution of the holes progressively rises and shifts rightwards; we compare

spot and magnetic flux distributions on rapidly rotating stars, which have a
significant impact on their angular momentum loss rate through magnetised
winds. Supplementing the formalism of MacGregor & Brenner (1991) with a
latitude-dependent magnetised wind model, we analyse the effect of analytically
prescribed surface distributions of open magnetic flux with different shapes
and degrees of non-uniformity on the rotational evolution of a solar-like star.
The angular momentum redistribution inside the star is treated in a qualitative
way, assuming an angular momentum transfer between the rigidly-rotating
radiative and convective zones on a constant coupling timescale of 15 Myr; for
the sake of simplicity we disregard interactions with circumstellar disks. We
find that non-uniform flux distributions entail rotational histories which
differ significantly from those of classical approaches, with differences
cumulating up to 200% during the main sequence phase. Their impact is able to
mimic deviations of the dynamo efficiency from linearity of up to 40% and
nominal dynamo saturation limits at about 35 times the solar rotation rate.
Concentrations of open magnetic flux at high latitudes thus assist in the
formation of very rapidly rotating stars in young open clusters, and ease the
necessity for a dynamo saturation at small rotation rates. However, since our
results show that even minor amounts of open flux at intermediate latitudes, as
observed with Zeeman-Doppler imaging techniques, are sufficient to moderate
this reduction of the AM loss rate, we suggest that non-uniform flux
distributions are a complementary rather than an alternative explanation for
very rapid stellar rotation.

the Larson size-linewidth relation is obeyed to the smallest scales studied
here extending the range of validity of this relationship by nearly 2 orders of
magnitude. The velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is constructed
showing extended exponential wings, providing evidence of intermittency,
further supported by the skewness and kurtosis of the velocity distribution.
Variance and kurtosis of the PDF of velocity differences are constructed as a
function of lag. The variance shows an approximate power law dependence on lag,
with exponent significantly lower than the Kolmogorov value, and with
deviations below 2000AU which are attributed to outflows and possibly disk
structures associated with low mass star formation within OMC1. The kurtosis
shows strong deviation from a gaussian velocity field, providing evidence of
velocity correlations at small lags. Results agree accurately with
semi-empirical simulations in Eggers & Wang (1998).

between 500 and 2200 AU. These show considerable diversity with regard to PDFs

as shown by Sellwood (2003), very sensitive to inclusion of asymmetric terms
(odd l,m). In order to disentangle possible numerical artifacts due to the
usage of spherical harmonics from genuine stellar dynamical effects, we
performed similar experiments using a tree code and find that significant cusp
destruction requires substantially more angular momentum than is realistically
available. However, we find that the simplified model (a N-body halo torqued by
a rotating bar pinned to the origin) undergoes an instability in which the cusp
moves away from the origin. In presence of this off-centring, spherical density
profiles centred on the origin display an apparent cusp-removal. We strongly
suspect that it is this effect which Weinberg & Katz observed. When suppressing
the artificial instability, cusp removal is very slow and requires much more
angular momentum to be transferred to the halo than a realistic stellar bar
possibly possesses.

argued that these kinematic constraints play a central role in defining the
quantum field theories of relevance to the description of quantum liquid
crystalline states of the nematic type. This forms the motivation to analyze
more thoroughly the climb constraints underlying the glide motions. In the
setting of continuum field theory the climb constraint is equivalent to the
condition that the density of constituent particles is vanishing and we derive
a mathematical definition of this constraint which has a universal status. This
makes possible to study the kinematics of dislocations in arbitrary space-time
dimensions and as an example we analyze the restricted climb associated with
edge dislocations in 3+1D. Very generally, it can be shown that the climb
constraint is equivalent to the condition that dislocations do not communicate
with compressional stresses at long distances. However, the formalism makes
possible to address the full non-linear theory of relevance to short distance
behaviors where violations of the constraint become possible.

group rotation is perhaps the simplest one, since all the relevant interactions
on the methyl group can be condensed in an effective mean-field one-dimensional
potential. Recent experimental neutron scattering results have stimulated a new
revival of the interest on methyl group dynamics in glasses and polymer
systems. The existence of quantum rotational tunnelling of methyl groups in
polymers was expected for a long time but only very recently (1998), these
processes have been directly observed by high-resolution neutron scattering
techniques. This paper revises and summarizes the work done on this topic over
last ten years by means of neutron scattering. It is shown that the results
obtained in many chemically and structurally different polymers can be
consistently described in the whole temperature range -- from the quantum
tunnelling limit to the classical hopping regime -- as well as in the
librational spectrum, in terms of the Rotation Rate Distribution Model (RRDM),
which was first proposed in 1994. This model introduces a distribution of
potential barriers for methyl group rotation, which is associated to the
disorder present in any structural glass. The molecular and structural origin
of the barrier distribution in polymers is discussed on the basis of a huge
collection of investigations reported in the literature, including recent fully
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.

wide interest for their possible application to ultra precise interferometry
and ultra weak force sensors. Since condensates, unlike photons, are
interacting, they may permit the realization of specific quantum states needed
as input of an interferometer to approach the Heisenberg limit, the supposed
lower bound to precision phase measurements. To this end, we study the
sensitivity to external weak perturbations of a representative matter-wave
Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose input are two Bose-Einstein condensates
created by splitting a single condensate in two parts. The interferometric
phase sensitivity depends on the specific quantum state created with the two
condensates, and, therefore, on the time scale of the splitting process. We
identify three different regimes, characterized by a phase sensitivity $\Delta
\theta$ scaling with the total number of condensate particles $N$ as i) the
standard quantum limit $\Delta \theta \sim 1/N^{1/2}$, ii) the sub shot-noise
$\Delta \theta \sim 1/N^{3/4}$ and the iii) the Heisenberg limit $\Delta \theta
\sim 1/N$. However, in a realistic dynamical BEC splitting, the 1/N limit
requires a long adiabaticity time scale, which is hardly reachable
experimentally. On the other hand, the sub shot-noise sensitivity $\Delta
\theta \sim 1/N^{3/4}$ can be reached in a realistic experimental setting. We
also show that the $1/N^{3/4}$ scaling is a rigorous upper bound in the limit
$N \to \infty$, while keeping constant all different parameters of the bosonic
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

data compression, we explore, in this paper, methods of the same spirit in
universal prediction of individual sequences. By context-tree prediction, we
refer to a family of prediction schemes, where at each time instant $t$, after
having observed all outcomes of the data sequence $x_1,...,x_{t-1}$, but not
yet $x_t$, the prediction is based on a ``context'' (or a state) that consists
of the $k$ most recent past outcomes $x_{t-k},...,x_{t-1}$, where the choice of
$k$ may depend on the contents of a possibly longer, though limited, portion of
the observed past, $x_{t-k_{\max}},...x_{t-1}$. This is different from the
study reported in [1], where general finite-state predictors as well as
``Markov'' (finite-memory) predictors of fixed order, were studied in the
regime of individual sequences.
  Another important difference between this study and [1] is the asymptotic
regime. While in [1], the resources of the predictor (i.e., the number of
states or the memory size) were kept fixed regardless of the length $N$ of the
data sequence, here we investigate situations where the number of contexts or
states is allowed to grow concurrently with $N$. We are primarily interested in
the following fundamental question: What is the critical growth rate of the
number of contexts, below which the performance of the best context-tree
predictor is still universally achievable, but above which it is not? We show
that this critical growth rate is linear in $N$. In particular, we propose a
universal context-tree algorithm that essentially achieves optimum performance
as long as the growth rate is sublinear, and show that, on the other hand, this
is impossible in the linear case.

the details of such a particle's internal structure influence its equations of
motion. We place essentially no restrictions (other than boundedness) on the
shape of the charge, and allow for inhomogeneity, internal currents,
elasticity, and spin. Even if the angular momentum remains small, many such
systems are found to be affected by large self-interaction effects beyond the
standard Lorentz-Dirac force. These are particularly significant if the
particle's charge density fails to be much greater than its 3-current density
(or vice versa) in the center-of-mass frame. Additional terms also arise in the
equations of motion if the dipole moment is too large, and when the
`center-of-electromagnetic mass' is far from the `center-of-bare mass' (roughly
speaking). These conditions are often quite restrictive. General equations of
motion were also derived under the assumption that the particle can only
interact with the radiative component of its self-field. These are much simpler
than the equations derived using the full retarded self-field; as are the
conditions required to recover the Lorentz-Dirac equation.

asymmetry. Contributions non-local in space-time to the self-energy dominate
over the asymmetry for $T \gtrsim 3-5 \mathrm{MeV}$ if the lepton and neutrino
asymmetries are of the same order as the baryon asymmetry. We find a new
contribution which cannot be interpreted as the usual effective potential. The
mixing angles and dispersion relations in the medium depend on \emph{helicity}.
We find that resonant transitions are possible in the temperature range $ 10

oscillation time scale in the medium as compared to the vacuum is
\emph{slowed-down} substantially for small vacuum mixing angle. The time scale

which the mixing angle becomes vanishingly small. The equations of motion
reduce to the familiar oscillation formulae for negative helicity
ultrarelativistic neutrinos, but include consistently both the \emph{mixing

also allow to study the dynamics of right handed as well as positive helicity

solved by reducing them to effective one-boson--one-fermion equations for

HERA will be accessible at the LHC through these ultraperipheral processes.
Indeed, these measurements can extend the HERA $x$ range by roughly a factor of
10 for similar virtualities. Nonlinear effects on the parton densities will
thus be significantly more important in these collisions than at HERA.

presence of axions and generate effective Majorana masses for neutrinos at the
electroweak scale. On the other hand, these terms break lepton number and
R-parity explicitly implying that the phenomenology of this model is very
different from the one of the MSSM or NMSSM. For example, the usual neutralinos
are now mixed with the neutrinos. For Dirac masses of the latter of order
$10^{-4}$ GeV, eigenvalues reproducing the correct scale of neutrino masses are
obtained.

such that E(Y|X)=E(Y|\eta^TX). The CMS defines the inferential object for this
problem and IHT provides an estimating procedure. Compared with other methods,
IHT requires fewer assumptions and has been shown to perform well when the
additional assumptions required by those methods fail. In this paper we give an
asymptotic analysis of IHT and provide stepwise asymptotic hypothesis tests to
determine the dimension of the CMS, as estimated by IHT. Here, the original IHT
method has been modified to be invariant under location and scale
transformations. To provide empirical support for our asymptotic results, we
will present a series of simulation studies. These agree well with the theory.
The method is applied to analyze an ozone data set.

saturated one-way layout with an ordinal factor. The least squares estimator
for the mean vector in this saturated model is usually inadmissible. The hybrid
shrinkage estimators of this paper exploit the possibility of slow variation in
the dependence of the means on the ordered factor levels but do not assume it
and respond well to faster variation if present. To motivate the development,
candidate penalized least squares (PLS) estimators for the mean vector of a
one-way layout are represented as shrinkage estimators relative to the penalty
basis for the regression space. This canonical representation suggests further
classes of candidate estimators for the unknown means: monotone shrinkage (MS)
estimators or soft-thresholding (ST) estimators or, most generally, hybrid
shrinkage (HS) estimators that combine the preceding two strategies. Adaptation
selects the estimator within a candidate class that minimizes estimated risk.
Under the Gaussian saturated one-way layout model, such adaptive estimators
minimize risk asymptotically over the class of candidate estimators as the
number of factor levels tends to infinity. Thereby, adaptive HS estimators
asymptotically dominate adaptive MS and adaptive ST estimators as well as the
least squares estimator. Local annihilators of polynomials, among them
difference operators, generate penalty bases suitable for a range of numerical
examples.

on the asymptotic distribution of \pi_{BIC} under both the null hypothesis and
local alternatives. One version of \pi_{BIC}, call it \pi_{BIC}^*, uses a class
of models that are orthogonal to each other and growing in number without bound

show that \pi_{BIC}^* can detect local alternatives converging to the null at

second-order asymptotic accuracy is calculated by the two-level bootstrap of
Efron, Halloran and Holmes [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93 (1996)

theory, where the geometry, such as the signed distance and the curvature of
the boundary, plays an important role. We give another calculation of the
corrected p-value without finding the ``nearest point'' on the boundary to the
observation, which is required in the two-level bootstrap and is an
implementational burden in complicated problems. The key idea is to alter the
sample size of the replicated dataset from that of the observed dataset. The
frequency of the replicates falling in the region is counted for several sample
sizes, and then the p-value is calculated by looking at the change in the
frequencies along the changing sample sizes. This is the multiscale bootstrap
of Shimodaira [Systematic Biology 51 (2002) 492-508], which is third-order

(1987) 234-251] scatter matrix; they generalize the univariate signed rank
procedures proposed by Hallin and Puri [J. Multivariate Anal. 39 (1991) 1-29].
Two types of optimality properties are considered, both in the local and
asymptotic sense, a la Le Cam: (a) (fixed-score procedures) local asymptotic
minimaxity at selected radial densities, and (b) (estimated-score procedures)
local asymptotic minimaxity uniform over a class F of radial densities.
Contrary to their classical counterparts, based on cross-covariance matrices,
these tests remain valid under arbitrary elliptically symmetric innovation
densities, including those with infinite variance and heavy-tails. We show that
the AREs of our fixed-score procedures, with respect to traditional (Gaussian)
methods, are the same as for the tests of randomness proposed in Hallin and
Paindaveine [Bernoulli 8 (2002b) 787-815]. The multivariate serial extensions
of the classical Chernoff-Savage and Hodges-Lehmann results obtained there thus
also hold here; in particular, the van der Waerden versions of our tests are
uniformly more powerful than those based on cross-covariances. As for our
estimated-score procedures, they are fully adaptive, hence, uniformly optimal

without any moment condition. This confirms the folklore that the Student's
t-statistic is robust against outliers. The saddlepoint approximation not only
provides a very accurate approximation for the Student's t-statistic, but it
also can be applied much more widely in statistical inference. As a result,
saddlepoint approximations should always be used whenever possible. Some
numerical work will be given to illustrate these points.

determined by truncated random variables. Two important statistical
applications are the following: the approximation of certain multivariate
cumulative distribution functions; and the approximation of passage time
distributions in ion channel models which incorporate time interval omission.
We derive two types of representation for the MGF of a truncated random
variable. One of these representations is obtained by exponential tilting. The
second type of representation, which has two versions, is referred to as an
exponential convolution representation. Each representation motivates a
different approximation. It turns out that each of the three approximations is
extremely accurate in those cases ``to which it is suited.'' Moreover, there is
a simple rule of thumb for deciding which approximation to use in a given case,
and if this rule is followed, then our numerical and theoretical results
indicate that the resulting approximation will be extremely accurate.

obtain upper bounds on the transition probabilities, estimates for exit time
probabilities, and certain lower bounds on the transition probabilities. We
show that a uniform Harnack inequality holds if an additional assumption is
made, but that without this assumption such an inequality need not hold. We
establish a central limit theorem giving conditions for a sequence of

can follow two strategies: either to defect or to cooperate. Serval alternative

the persistence of the cooperation. Particularly, the system exhibits a phase
transition, from active state (coexistence of cooperators and defectors) to
absorbing state (only defectors surviving) when allowing `` worse\rq\rq

numerical evaluation of matrix element for all values of incident photon energy
and comparison is made with results obtained by different methods.

theory of the topos formed by the collection of all $M$-sets, where $M$ is a
monoid. Earlier results on topos aspects of quantum theory can be rederived in
this way. However, the formalism also suggests a new way of constructing a
`neo-realist' interpretation of quantum theory in which the truth values of
propositions are determined by the actions of the monoid of strings of finite
projection operators. By these means, a novel topos perspective is gained on
the concept of state-vector reduction.
