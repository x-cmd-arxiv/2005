presumably by reconnection, at scales comparable to the size of a solar flare
loop to scales comparable to particle gyroradii, and evaluate their damping by
various mechanisms. We show that the classical viscous damping is unimportant
for magnetically dominated or low beta plasmas and the primary damping
mechanism is the collisionless damping by the background particles. We show
that the damping rate is proportional to the total random momentum density of
the particles. For solar flare conditions this means that in most flares,
except the very large ones, the damping is dominated by thermal background
electrons. For large flares one requires acceleration of essentially all
background electrons into a nonthermal distribution so that the accelerated
electrons can be important in the damping of the waves. In general, damping by
thermal or nonthermal protons is negligible compared to that of electrons
except for quasi-perpendicular propagating waves or for rare proton dominated
flares with strong nuclear gamma-ray line emission. Using the rate for damping
we determine the critical scale below which the damping becomes important and
the spectrum of the turbulence steepens. This critical scale, however, has
strong dependence on the angle of propagation with respect to the magnetic
field direction. The waves can cascade down to very small scales, such as the
gyroradii of the particles at small angles (quasi-parallel propagation) and
possibly near 90 degree (quasi-perpendicular propagation) giving rise to a
highly anisotropic spectral distribution.

high resolution of the Chandra observation has allowed us to refine the
original merging scenario proposed for A521, and to reveal new features in its
X-ray emission. A521 has strongly substructured ICM density and temperature
maps. Its X-ray diffuse emission is elongated along a NW/SE direction (SX2) and
shows two major components, a main cluster and a northern group of galaxies.
This latter is in turn substructured, showing a clump of cold and very dense
gas centred on the BCG, and a northern tail aligned in the SX2 direction. A
compression of the X-ray isophotes is also observed South of the BCG. We
conclude that the northern group is infalling onto the main cluster along the
NW/SE direction. This hypothesis is corroborated by the presence of a hot bar
in the ICM temperature map located between the southern and northern regions,
as the gas could be compressionally heated due to the subclusters' collision.
The hot region corresponds to the eastern part of an over-dense ridge of
galaxies, along which it was originally suggested that a merging of subclusters
has recently occurred along the line of sight. An alternative hypothesis about
the origin of the hot central bar is that we could observe in projection the
shock fronts due to this older cluster-cluster collision. Two other structures
possibly interacting with the main cluster are detected on the West and
North-East sides of the BCG. We also uncover the presence of two northern edges
in the ICM density. A521 is a spectacular example of a multiple merger cluster
made up by several substructures converging at different epochs towards the
centre of the system. The very pertubed dynamical state of this cluster is also
confirmed by our discovery of a radio relic in its South-East region.

direct coupling in the Lagrangian of the underlying theory has acquired an
increasing interest due to the recently discovered capability of the extended
quintessence model to encompass the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological
constant. The gravity induced ""R-boost"" mechanism is indeed responsible for an
early, enhanced scalar field dynamics, by virtue of which the residual imprint
of a wide set of initial field values is cancelled out. The initial conditions
problem is particularly relevant, as the most recent observations indicate that
the dark energy equation of state approaches, at the present time, the
cosmological constant value, wDE = -1; if confirmed, such observational
evidence would cancel the advantage of a standard, minimally coupled scalar
field as a Dark Energy candidate instead of the cosmological constant, because
of the huge fine tuning it would require. We give here a general classification
of the scalar-tensor gravity theories admitting R-boost solutions scaling as a
power of the cosmological redshift, outlining those behaving as an attractor
for the quintessence field. In particular, we show that all the R-boost
solutions with the dark energy density scaling as the relativistic matter or
shallower represent attractors. This analysis is exhaustive as for the
classification of the couplings which admit R-boost and the subsequent
enlargement of the basin of attraction enclosing the initial scalar field
values.

a promising candidate for halting condensation in clusters with short central
cooling times because they are common in such clusters. In order to test the
AGN-heating hypothesis, we obtained Chandra observations of two clusters with
short central cooling times yet no evidence for AGN activity: Abell 1650 and
Abell 2244. The cores of these clusters indeed appear systematically different
from cores with more prominent radio emission. They do not have significant
central temperature gradients, and their central entropy levels are markedly
higher than in clusters with stronger radio emission, corresponding to central
cooling times ~ 1 Gigayear. Also, there is no evidence for fossil X-ray
cavities produced by an earlier episode of AGN heating. We suggest that either
(1) the central gas has not yet cooled to the point at which feedback is
necessary to prevent it from condensing, possibly because it is conductively
stabilized, or (2) the gas experienced a major heating event $\gtrsim 1$ Gyr in
the past and has not required feedback since then. The fact that these clusters
with no evident feedback have higher central entropy and therefore longer
central cooling times than clusters with obvious AGN feedback strongly suggests
that AGNs supply the feedback necessary to suppress condensation in clusters
with short central cooling times.

ram-pressure stripping of galaxy gas, due to NGC4552's motion through the

combining a detailed study of 65 S0-Sb galaxies with measurements of 70 Sb-Sd
galaxies from Martin (1995). As has been noted before with smaller samples,
bars in early-type (S0-Sb) galaxies are clearly larger than bars in late-type
(Sc-Sd) galaxies; this is true both for relative sizes (bar length as fraction
of isophotal radius R_25 or exponential disc scale length h) and absolute sizes
(kpc). S0-Sab bars extend to ~1-10 kpc (mean ~3.3 kpc), ~0.2-0.8 R_25 (mean
\~0.38 R_25) and ~0.5-2.5 h (mean ~1.4 h). Late-type bars extend to only

and 0.6 h. Sb galaxies resemble earlier-type galaxies in terms of bar size
relative to h; their smaller R_25-relative sizes may be a side effect of higher
star formation, which increases R_25 but not h. For S0-Sbc galaxies, bar size
correlates well with disc size (both R_25 and h); these correlations are
stronger than the known correlation with M_B. All correlations appear to be
weaker or absent for late-type galaxies; in particular, there seems to be no
correlation between bar size and either h or M_B for Sc-Sd galaxies.
  I show that the bars detected in HST near-IR images at z ~ 1 by Sheth et al.
(2003) have absolute sizes consistent with those in bright, nearby S0-Sb
galaxies. I also compare the sizes of real bars with those produced in
simulations, and discuss some possible implications for scenarios of secular
evolution along the Hubble sequence. Simulations often produce bars as large as
-- or larger than -- those seen in S0-Sb galaxies, but rarely any as small as
those in Sc-Sd galaxies. (Abridged.)

ranging from 0.023 to 0.057 AU using a generalized scaled theory for mass loss,
together with new surface-condition grids for hot EGPs and a consistent
treatment of tidal truncation. Theoretical estimates for the rate of
energy-limited hydrogen escape from giant-planet atmospheres differ by two
orders of magnitude, when one holds planetary mass, composition, and
irradiation constant. Baraffe et al. (2004, A&A 419, L13-L16) predict the
highest rate, based on the theory of Lammer et al. (2003, Astrophys. J. 598,

parameters for a highly-irradiated exoplanet, we find an escape rate ~102 lower
than Baraffe's. With the scaled Watson theory we find modest mass loss,
occurring early in the history of a hot EGP. In this theory, mass loss
including the effect of Roche-lobe overflow becomes significant primarily for
masses below a Saturn mass, for semimajor axes = 0.023 AU. This contrasts with
the Baraffe model, where hot EGPs are claimed to be remnants of much more
massive bodies, originally several times Jupiter and still losing substantial

motion). To reconcile this discrepancy we propose that PSR J0538+2817 could be
the stellar remnant of the first supernova explosion in a massive binary system
and therefore could be as old as its characteristic age. Our proposal implies
that S147 is the diffuse remnant of the second supernova explosion (that
disrupted the binary system) and that a much younger second neutron star (not
necessarily manifesting itself as a radio pulsar) should be associated with
S147. We use the existing observational data on the system to suggest that the
progenitor of the supernova that formed S147 was a Wolf-Rayet star (so that the
supernova explosion occurred within a wind bubble surrounded by a massive
shell) and to constrain the parameters of the binary system. We also restrict
the magnitude and direction of the kick velocity received by the young neutron
star at birth and find that the kick vector should not strongly deviate from
the orbital plane of the binary system.

different variables of a system. It leads naturally to the introduction of
compound parameters describing physical properties of the system. Often one of
the variables of interest is the object dimension, or time. The prevalence of a
simple power law over the entire range of dimensions or times can be helpfully
interpreted as size or time independence of the corresponding compound physical
parameter of the system. However, it is also often found that a simple power
law only persists for some extreme values, e.g. for very large and/or small
sizes, or very short or long times. Transitions between regimes of different
power law asymptotic behaviour are encountered frequently in the description of
a wide variety of physical systems. While asymptotic power law behaviour may
often be readily predicted, e.g. on dimensional grounds, the evaluation of the
relationship between system parameters in the transition range usually requires
laborious detailed solution. To obviate this difficulty we introduce, on rather
general basis, something we refer to as the merging, or 'knee' function. The
function possesses sufficient flexibility to describe transitions of various
sharpness. To demonstrate its usefuness, the merging function is applied to a
variety of well-known scaling laws in the mechanics and strength of materials

Specifically, the achievable rate or rate-distortion region has been described
by a first order information-theoretic functional of the source statistics in
each of the above cases. At the same time several problems have also remained
unsolved. Notable two terminal examples include the joint distortion problem,
where both sources are reconstructed under a combined distortion criterion, as
well as the partial side information problem, where one source is reconstructed
under a distortion criterion using information about the other (side
information) available at a certain rate (partially). In this paper we solve
both of these open problems. Specifically, we give an infinite order
description of the achievable rate-distortion region in each case. In our
analysis we set the above problems in a general framework and formulate a
unified methodology that solves not only the problems at hand but any two
terminal problem with noncooperative encoding. The key to such unification is
held by a fundamental source coding principle which we derive by extending the
typicality arguments of Shannon and Wyner-Ziv. Finally, we demonstrate the
expansive scope of our technique by re-deriving known coding theorems. We shall
observe that our infinite order descriptions simplify to the expected first

development and numerical integration it turns out that, unfortunately, most of
the secular component of the gravitomagnetic signature is removed in the
process of fitting the initial conditions. Indeed, an estimation of the
magnitude of the Lense-Thirring effect in the ephemerides residuals is given;
the resulting residuals have a maximum magnitude of 20 meters only (over 125
years).

also find a tower of non-tachyonic Higgs KK modes at the weak scale. We
consider an interesting implementation of this ``Off-the-Wall Higgs'' mechanism
where the 5-dimensional curvature-scalar coupling alone generates the tachyonic
mode responsible for EWSB. In this case, additional relations among the
parameters of the Higgs and gravitational sectors are established. We discuss

of trivial character. More precisely, the modularity lifting result needed at a
crucial step is the one for the case of a deformation corresponding to a
$p$-adic semistable (in the sense of Fontaine) Galois representation attached
to a semistable abelian variety, but in Khare's preprint it is applied a lemma
only valid for potentially crystalline representations. The completion is easy:
both the modularity lifting result applied in Khare's preprint (the one for the
case of an abelian variety with potentially good reduction) and the one we need
(the one for an abelian variety with bad semistable reduction) can be found in
my paper ""Modularity of abelian surfaces with Quaternionic Multiplication""

recent findings in lattice computations of Quantum Chromodynamics, is the
existence of D- and B-meson states in the sQGP, providing resonant cross
sections for heavy quarks up to temperatures of sim 2 T_c. Pertinent drag and
diffusion coefficients are implemented into a relativistic Langevin simulation
to compute transverse-momentum spectra and azimuthal asymmetries (v_2) of b-

calculated from a combination of coalescence with light quarks and
fragmentation, and associated electron-decay spectra and v_2 are compared to
recent RHIC data. We also comment on the relative importance of radiative and

Several observations and theoretical arguments seem to support the idea that
winter planetary waves indicator obey a non-Gaussian statistics and may present
a multimodal probability density function, thus characterizing the
low-frequency portion of the climate system. We show that the upper
tropospheric jet strength is a critical parameter in determining whether the
planetary waves indicator exhibits a uni- or bimodal behavior, and we determine
the relevant threshold value of the jet. These results are obtained by
considering the data of the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for the overlapping

the statistical non-normality of the low-frequency variability of the

  Systems","27pages, 43 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM",,"  The presented previously indirect optimization method (IOM) developed within
biochemical systems theory (BST) provides a versatile and mathematically
tractable optimization strategy for biochemical systems. However, due to the
local approximations nature of the BST formalism, the iterative version of this
technique possibly does not yield the true optimum solution. In this work, an
algorithm is proposed to obtain the correct and consistent optimum steady-state
operating point of biochemical systems. The existing linear optimization
problem of the direct IOM approach is modified by adding an equality constraint
of describing the consistency of solutions between the S-system and the
original model. Lagrangian analysis is employed to derive the first order
necessary optimality conditions for the above modified optimization problem.
This leads to a procedure that may be regarded as a modified iterative IOM
approach in which the optimization objective function includes an extra linear
term. The extra term contains a comparison of metabolite concentration
derivatives with respect to the enzyme activities between the S-system and the
original model and ensures that the new algorithm is still carried out within
linear programming techniques. The presented framework is applied to several
biochemical systems and shown to the tractability and effectiveness of the
method. The simulation is also studied to investigate the convergence
properties of the algorithm and to give a performance comparison of standard
and modified iterative IOM approach.
