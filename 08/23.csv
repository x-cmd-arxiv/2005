by long term monitoring of X-ray bursters, believed to be due to unstable
ignition of carbon in the deep ocean of the neutron star. A number of
""intermediate duration"" bursts have also been observed, probably associated
with ignition of a thick helium layer. We investigate the sensitivity of these
long X-ray bursts to the thermal profile of the neutron star crust and core. We
first compare cooling models of superburst lightcurves with observations, and
derive constraints on the ignition mass and energy release, and then calculate
ignition models for superbursts and pure helium bursts, and compare to
observations. The superburst lightcurves and ignition models imply that the
carbon mass fraction is approximately 20% or greater in the fuel layer,
constraining models of carbon production. However, the most important result is
that when Cooper pairing neutrino emission is included in the crust, the
temperature is too low to support unstable carbon ignition at the observed
column depths. Some additional heating mechanism is required in the
accumulating fuel layer to explain the observed properties of superbursts. If
Cooper pair emission is less efficient than currently thought, the observed
ignition depths for superbursts imply that the crust is a poor conductor, and
the core neutrino emission is not more efficient than modified URCA. The
observed properties of helium bursts support these conclusions, requiring
inefficient crust conductivity and core neutrino emission.

galaxies spanning a wide range of mass. We measure structural parameters for
the galaxies using two-dimensional least-squares fitting to our $R$-band
photometry. The fits require both a thick and a thin disk to adequately fit the
data. The thick disks have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths than
the embedded thin disks, by factors of ~2 and ~1.25, respectively. The observed
structural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disks
derived from star counts in the Milky Way and from resolved stellar populations
in nearby galaxies. We find that massive galaxies' luminosities are dominated
by the thin disk. However, in low mass galaxies (Vc < 120 km/s), thick disk
stars contribute nearly half of the luminosity and dominate the stellar mass.
Thus, although low mass dwarf galaxies appear blue, the majority of their stars
are probably quite old.
  Our data are most easily explained by a formation scenario where the thick
disk is assembled through direct accretion of stellar material from merging
satellites while the thin disk is formed from accreted gas. The baryonic
fraction in the thin disk therefore constrains the gas-richness of the merging
pre-galactic fragments. If we include the mass in HI as part of the thin disk,
the thick disk contains <10% of the baryons in high mass galaxies, and ~25-30%
of the baryons in low-mass galaxies. We discuss how our trends can be explained
by supernova-driven outflow at early times as well as the possibilities for
predicting abundance trends in thick disks, and for removing discrepancies
between semi-analytic galaxy formation models and the observed colors of low
mass galaxies. (abstract abridged)

of differential rotation, and progenitor mass. For the models considered, we
find a roughly linear mapping between initial iron core rotation rate and PNS
spin. The results indicate that the magnitude of the precollapse iron core
angular velocities is the single most important factor in determining the PNS
spin. Differences in progenitor mass and degree of differential rotation lead
only to small variations in the PNS rotational period and profile. Based on our
calculated PNS spins, at ~ 200-300 milliseconds after bounce, and assuming
angular momentum conservation, we estimate final neutron star rotation periods.
We find periods of one millisecond and shorter for initial central iron core
periods of below ~ 10 s. This is appreciably shorter than what previous studies
have predicted and is in disagreement with current observational data from
pulsar astronomy. After considering possible spindown mechanisms that could
lead to longer periods we conclude that there is no mechanism that can robustly
spin down a neutron star from ~ 1 ms periods to the ""injection"" periods of tens
to hundreds of milliseconds observed for young pulsars. Our results indicate
that, given current knowledge of the limitations of neutron star spindown
mechanisms, precollapse iron cores must rotate with periods around 50-100
seconds to form neutron stars with periods generically near those inferred for

seen in particle-in-cell simulations, consists of magnetically self-pinched
current filaments. The filaments are parallel to the direction of propagation
of the shock and are about a plasma skin depth in radius, forming a
quasi--two-dimensional structure. We use a rudimentary analytical model to
argue that the Weibel filaments are unstable to a kink-like mode, which
destroys their quasi--two-dimensional structure. For wavelengths longer than
than the skin depth, the instability grows at the rate equal to the speed of
light divided by the wavelength. We calculate the transport of collisionless
test particles in the filaments experiencing the instability and show that the

decay as particles escape from the filaments. We discuss the implications of

obey r**-2 and r**-3 density power laws. The cloud gravity is included as a
time-independent, external force. Stellar velocities of 0, 2, 8, and 12 km/s
are considered. When stellar motion is included, stars move from the central
core to the edge of the cloud, producing transitions from ultracompact to
extended HII regions as the stars move into lower density regions. The opposite
behavior occurs when stars move toward the cloud cores. The main conclusion of
our study is that ultracompact HII regions are pressure-confined entities while
they remain embedded within dense cores. The confinement comes from ram and/or
ambient pressures. The survival of ultracompact regions depends on the position
of the star with respect to the core, the stellar life-time, and the core
crossing time. Stars with velocities less than the cloud dispersion velocity
can produce cometary shapes smaller than 0.1 pc at times of 20,000 yr or more.
The sequence Ultracompact to Compact to Extended HII region shows a variety of

self-blocking effects, when stars overtake and ionize leading, piled-up clumps
of neutral gas. We use thermal energy to support the cloud against gravity; the
results remain the same if other types of isotropic cloud support are used.

prominent cluster (Region D1) lies in the north-center. This cluster is over 20
pc to the south of the Monoceros ridge, the interface of the emerging young OB
cluster NGC 2244 with its ambient molecular clouds. In addition, there are
several branches stemming from AFGL 961 in Region C and extending to the
south-east boundary of the cloud. We invoke a tree model to interpret this
pattern, corresponding to probable tracks of abrupt turbulent excitation and
subsequent decay. Alternatively, we discuss gravoturbulent collapse scenarios
based on numerical simulations. Relative stellar ages and gas flow directions
will differentiate between these mechanisms.

intensity of the barred galaxies NGC 1097 and NGC 1365. Both galaxies exhibit
radio ridges roughly overlapping with the massive dust lanes in the bar region.
The contrast in total intensity across the radio ridges is compatible with
compression and shear of an isotropic random magnetic field. The contrast in
polarized intensity is significantly smaller than that expected from
compression and shearing of the regular magnetic field; this could be the
result of decoupling of the regular field from the dense molecular clouds. The
regular field in the ridge is probably strong enough to reduce significantly
shear in the diffuse gas (to which it is coupled) and hence to reduce magnetic
field amplification by shearing. This contributes to the misalignment of the
observed field orientation with respect to the velocity vectors of the dense
gas. Our observations, for the first time, indicate that magnetic forces can
control the flow of the diffuse interstellar gas at kiloparsec scales. The
total radio intensity reaches its maximum in the circumnuclear starburst
regions, where the equipartition field strength is about 60\mu G, amongst the
strongest fields detected in spiral galaxies so far. The regular field in the
inner region has a spiral shape with large pitch angle, indicating the action
of a dynamo. Magnetic stress leads to mass inflow towards the centre,
sufficient to feed the active nucleus in NGC 1097. We detected diffuse X-ray

interacting with turbulent disks. We calculate the orbital evolution of
`planetesimals' and protoplanets with masses in the range 0 < m_p < 30 M_Earth.
Planetesimals and protoplanets undergo stochastic migration due to interaction
with turbulent density fluctuations. Over run times of ~ 150 planet orbits,
stochastic migration dominates over type I migration for many models. Fourier
analysis of the torques experienced by planets indicates that the torque
fluctuations contain components with significant power whose time scales of
variation are similar to the simulation run times. These low frequency
fluctuations partly explain the dominance of stochastic torques, and may
provide a powerful means of counteracting the type I migration of some planets
in turbulent disks. Turbulence is a source of eccentricity driving.
Planetesimals attained eccentricities in the range 0.02 < e < 0.14, m_p=1
M_Earth planets attained eccentricities 0.02 < e < 0.08, and m_p=10 M_Earth
protoplanets reached 0.02 < e < 0.03. This is in basic agreement with a model
in which turbulence drives e-growth, and interaction with disk material at
coorbital Lindblad resonances causes e-damping. These results are significant
for planet formation. Stochastic migration may prevent some planet cores
migrating into their star via type I before becoming gas giants. The growth of
planetary cores may be enhanced by preventing isolation. Eccentricity
excitation by turbulence, however, may reduce growth rates of planetary cores
during the runaway and oligarchic growth stages, and cause collisions between
planetesimals to become destructive.

the spin polarization near the edge induced by this mechanism can be large, and
that it becomes larger and more strongly localized as the spin-orbit coupling
strength increases, and is independent of the width of the conducting strip

lengths longer and shorter than that of the hexane molecules. We provide
evidence that impurities in the monolayer, even in small proportion to the
hexane, could induce significant changes in the phase behavior and phase
transitions, and we propose that because of the size of pentane with respect to
hexane, and the nature of the solid herringbone phase, pentane impurities give
the best representation of the phase behavior observed for the pure hexane

to distort the sublattices of the solid herringbone phase, and hence lead to a

  from anisotropic disordered media: a Monte Carlo simulation","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.soft",,"  Constructive interference among coherent waves traveling time-reversed paths
in a random medium gives rise to the enhancement of light scattering observed
in directions close to backscattering. This phenomenon is known as enhanced
backscattering (EBS). According to diffusion theory, the angular width of an
EBS cone is proportional to the ratio of the wavelength of light $\lambda$ to
the transport mean free path length ls* of a random medium. In biological
media, large ls* ~ 0.5-2 mm >> $\lambda$ results in an extremely small (~0.001
$^\degree$) angular width of the EBS cone making the experimental observation
of such narrow peaks difficult. Recently, the feasibility of observing EBS
under low spatial coherence illumination (spatial coherence length Lsc<<ls*)
was demonstrated. Low spatial coherence behaves as a spatial filter rejecting
longer path-lengths and, thus, resulting in more than 100 times increase in the
angular width of low coherence EBS (LEBS) cones. However, conventional
diffusion approximation-based model of EBS has not been able to explain such
dramatic increase in LEBS width. Here we present a photon random walk model of
LEBS using Monte Carlo simulation to elucidate the mechanism accounting for the
unprecedented broadening of LEBS peaks. Typically, the exit angles of the
scattered photons are not considered in modeling EBS in diffusion regime. We
show that small exit angles are highly sensitive to low order scattering, which
is crucial for accurate modeling of LEBS. Our results show that the predictions
of the model are in excellent agreement with experimental data.

tiling is thermodynamically stabilized by its degeneracy entropy, well-known to
be $1.79k_{B}$ per particle from previous studies of the dimer problem on the

shown that the uniform throughput capacity per node r(n) is Theta((T)/(sqrt{n

  However an alternate communication model may also be considered, with each
node constrained to a maximum transmit power P_0 and capable of utilizing W Hz
of bandwidth. Under the limiting case W rightarrow infinity, such as in Ultra

transmitting over slow fading channels. These matrices are parameterized by
positive integers $L$ and $n$ and a prime power $q$. Based on Pascal's triangle
we give an explicit construction of universally decodable matrices for any
non-zero integers $L$ and $n$ and any prime power $q$ where $L \leq q+1$. This
is the largest set of possible parameter values since for any list of
universally decodable matrices the value $L$ is upper bounded by $q+1$, except
for the trivial case $n = 1$. For the proof of our construction we use
properties of Hasse derivatives, and it turns out that our construction has
connections to Reed-Solomon codes, Reed-Muller codes, and so-called
repeated-root cyclic codes. Additionally, we show how universally decodable
matrices can be modified so that they remain universally decodable matrices.

resolution, which the observer uses to probe the space(time) geometry. For
s=1/2, we are actually dealing with the qubit model, where the horizon is made
of a certain number of qubits. In this context, we compute the black hole
entropy and show that the factor in front of the logarithmic correction to the
entropy formula is independent of the unit s. We also compute the entanglement
between parts of the horizon. We show that these correlations between parts of
the horizon are directly responsible for the asymptotic logarithmic
corrections. This leads us to speculate on a relation between the evaporation
process and the entanglement between a pair of qubits and the rest of the
horizon. Finally, we introduce a concept of renormalisation of areas in LQG.

understanding of the possible role played by the inner horizons of
Reissner-Nordstr\""om and Kerr-Newman black holes in black hole thermodynamics
is still somewhat incomplete: There are derivations which imply that the
temperature of the inner horizon is negative and it is not quite clear what
this means. Motivated by this problem we perform a detailed analysis of the
radiation emitted by the inner horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole.
As a result we find that in a maximally extended Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime
virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are created at the inner horizon of the
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole such that real particles with positive energy
and temperature are emitted towards the singularity from the inner horizon and,
as a consequence, antiparticles with negative energy are radiated away from the
singularity through the inner horizon. We show that these antiparticles will
come out from the white hole horizon in the maximally extended
Reissner-Nordstr\""om spacetime, at least when the hole is near extremality. The
energy spectrum of the antiparticles leads to a positive temperature for the
white hole horizon. In other words, our analysis predicts that in addition to
the radiation effects of black hole horizons, also the white hole horizon
radiates. The black hole radiation is caused by the quantum effects at the
outer horizon, whereas the white hole radiation is caused by the quantum
effects at the inner horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole.

analytic continuations of Taub-NUT spacetimes. This generalizes previous
studies of 4-dimensional nutty bubbles. One 5-dimensional locally
asymptotically AdS solution in particular has a special conformal boundary
structure of $AdS_3\times S^1$. We compute its boundary stress tensor and
relate it to the properties of the dual field theory. Interestingly enough, we
also find consistent 6-dimensional bubble solutions that have only one timelike
direction. The existence of such spacetimes with non-trivial topology is
closely related to the existence of the Taub-NUT(-AdS) solutions with more than
one NUT charge. Finally, we begin an investigation of generating new solutions
from Taub-NUT spacetimes and nuttier bubbles. Using the so-called Hopf duality,
we provide new explicit time-dependent backgrounds in six dimensions.

vacuum solutions, with interacting metrics $f$ and $g$. Such solutions can be
classified into type I (or ""non-diagonal"") and type II (or ""diagonal""). The
general solution of type I is known, and leads to metrics $f$ and $g$ in the
Schwarzschild-(Anti)de Sitter family. The two metrics are not always
diagonalizable in the same coordinate system, and the light-cone structure of
both metrics can be quite different. In spite of this, we find that causality
is preserved, in the sense that closed time-like curves cannot be pieced
together from geodesics of both metrics. We propose maximal extensions of Type
I bigravity solutions, where geodesics of both metrics do not stop unless a
curvature singularity is encountered. Such maximal extensions can contain
several copies (or even an infinite number of them) of the maximally extended
""individual"" geometries associated to $f$ and $g$ separately. Generically, we
find that the maximal extensions of bigravity solutions are not globally
hyperbolic, even in cases when the individual geometries are. The general
solution of type II has not been given in closed form. We discuss a subclass
where $g$ is an arbitrary solution of Einstein's equations with a cosmological
constant, and we find that in this case the only solutions are such that
$f\propto g$ (with trivial causal structure).

Seminar at the Ecole Polytechnique in 1998 and the second given at the 2000
International Congress on Differential Geometry in memory of Alfred Gray in
Bilbao, Spain.
  It begins with a discussion of basic geometry of almost complex 6-manifolds.
In particular, I define a 2-parameter family of intrinsic first-order
functionals on almost complex structures on 6-manifolds and compute their
Euler-Lagrange equations.
  It also includes a discussion of a natural generalization of holomorphic
bundles over complex manifolds to the almost complex case. The general almost
complex manifold will not admit any nontrivial bundles of this type, but there
is a large class of nonintegrable almost complex manifolds for which there are
such nontrivial bundles. For example, the standard almost complex structure on
the 6-sphere admits such nontrivial bundles.
  This class of almost complex manifolds in dimension 6 will be referred to as
quasi-integrable. Some of the properties of quasi-integrable structures (both
almost complex and unitary) are developed and some examples are given. However,
it turns out that quasi-integrability is not an involutive condition, so the
full generality of these structures in Cartan's sense is not well-understood.

which show that a normal ECG signal, which is a function of time can be
transformed into a relatively simpler signal by stretching the time in a
predetermined way. Before such a transformation, if you were to analyze various
packets of the data for the Trans-Spectral Coherence (TSC) you could confirm
that the signal indeed is very complicated. This is because the TSC gives us an
idea of how various harmonics in a spectrum are related to one another. The
coherence dramatically improved once we found an intermediate variable..
However, there was one hurdle. To find this variable, we needed to postulate
that the complexified data lies on a 4-sheeted Riemann-Surface. With this
insight, we could identify a proper time transformation which led to extremely
high TSC.
  The transformed signal is quite simple. We can now rearrange the ECG data in
terms of a set of functions in an affine space, which we can explicitly
calculate from the data. This reveals that the dynamics of the heart, if freed
from the external influence is quite simple.

density. Spectral distribution theory (also known as nuclear statistical

convenient choice of subspaces are spherical shell-model configurations. We
revisit these configuration moments and find, for complete $0\hbar\omega$
many-body spaces, the following behaviors: (a) the configuration width is
nearly constant for all configurations; (b) the configuration asymmetry or
third moment is strongly correlated with the configuration centroid; (c) the
configuration fourth moment, or excess is linearly related to the square to the
configuration asymmetry. Such universal behavior may allow for more efficient
modeling of the density of states in a shell-model framework.

competition between short-range nuclear attraction and long-range Coulomb

properties, such as neutrino propagation through stellar environments. The
excitation spectrum of the nuclear pasta is computed via a molecular-dynamics

displays a classical plasma oscillation in the 1-2 MeV region. In addition,
substantial strength is found at low energies. Yet this low-energy strength is

electric dipole is presented. The results show that upon creation at the
source, both the longitudinal electric and transverse magnetic fields propagate
superluminally and reduce to the speed of light as they propagate about one
wavelength from the source. In contrast, the transverse electric field is shown
to be created about 1/4 wavelength outside the source and launches superluminal
fields both towards and away from the source which reduce to the speed of light
as the field propagates about one wavelength from the source. An experiment
using simple dipole antennas is shown to verify the predicted superluminal
transverse electric field behavior. In addition, it is shown that the fields
generated by a gravitational source propagate superluminally and can be modeled
using quadrapole electrodynamic theory. The phase speed, group speed, and
information speed of these systems are compared and shown to differ. Provided
the noise of a signal is small and the modulation method is known, it is shown
that the information speed can be approximately the same as the superluminal
group speed. According to relativity theory, it is known that between moving
reference frames, superluminal signals can propagate backwards in time enabling
violations of causality. Several explanations are presented which may resolve
this dilemma.

QCA, similar to those introduced by Shumacher and Werner, Watrous, and Van Dam.
We discuss also Margolus QCA, also discussed by Schumacher and Werner. We
introduce two new models, Coloured QCA, and Continuous-Time QCA. We also
compare our models with the established models. We give proofs of computational
equivalence for several of these models. We show the strengths of each model,
and provide examples of how our models can be useful to come up with
algorithms, and implement them in real-world physical devices.

qubits interact perpetually, and a separate 'store' where qubits exist in
isolation. Computation consists of single qubit operations, swaps between the
store and the core, and free evolution of the core. This enables computation
using physical systems where the entangling interactions are 'always on'.
Alternatively, for switchable systems our model constitutes a prescription for
optimizing many-qubit gates. We discuss implementations of the quantum Fourier
transform, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum error correction.

distribution of weak optical fields, where canonical phase is defined as the
complement of photon number. A binomial reference state is required for this
purpose, which we show can be obtained to an excellent degree of approximation
from a suitably squeezed state. The proposed method requires only
photodetectors that can distinguish among zero, one and more than one photons
and is not particularly sensitive to photodetector imperfections.

optimal eavesdropping attack against this protocol, for individual Gaussian
attacks, and we investigate and compare the no-switching protocol applied to
the original BB84 scheme.

We find that it is secure if the quantum signal transmitted is only a single
photon but insecure with a multi-photon signal as some agents can get the
information about the others' message if they attack the communication with a
Trojan horse. However, security against this attack can be attained with a
simple modification.

optical potential is formed by a cavity field with quantum properties. On the
one hand the common coupling of all atoms to the same mode introduces cavity
mediated long range atom-atom interactions and on the other hand atomic
backaction on the field introduces atom-field entanglement. This modifies the
properties of the associated quantum phase transitions and allows for new
correlated atom-field states including superposition of different atomic
quantum phases. After deriving an approximative Hamiltonian including the new
long range interaction terms we exhibit central physical phenomena at generic
configurations of few atoms in few wells. We find strong modifications of
population fluctuations and next-nearest neighbor correlations near the phase
transition point.
