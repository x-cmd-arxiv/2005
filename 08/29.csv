shock will form. We analyze the reverse-forward shocks in a wind environment,
including their dynamics and emission. An early afterglow is emitted from the
shocked shell, e.g., an optical flash may emerge. The reverse shock behaves
differently in two approximations: relativistic and Newtonian cases, which
depend on the parameters, e.g., the initial Lorentz factor of the ejecta. If
the initial Lorentz factor is much less than $114 E_{53}^{1/4}
\Delta_{0,12}^{-1/4} A_{*,-1}^{-1/4}$, the early reverse shock is Newtonian.
This may take place for the wider of a two-component jet, an orphan afterglow
caused by a low initial Lorentz factor, and so on. The synchrotron self
absorption effect is significant especially for the Newtonian reverse shock
case, since the absorption frequency $\nu_a$ is larger than the cooling
frequency $\nu_c$ and the minimum synchrotron frequency $\nu_m$ for typical
parameters. For the optical to X-ray band, the flux is nearly unchanged with
time during the early period, which may be a diagnostic for the low initial
Lorentz factor of the ejecta in a wind environment. We also investigate the
early light curves with different wind densities, and compare them with these
in the ISM model.

ionizing photons was set by a population of Ly-limit absorbers. As the
mean-free-path steadily grew, the intensity of the ionizing background also
grew, thus lowering the residual neutral fraction of hydrogen in ionization
equilibrium throughout the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM). Ly-alpha photons
provide a sensitive probe for tracing the distribution of this residual
hydrogen at the end of reionization. Here we calculate the cosmic variance
among different lines-of-sight in the distribution of the mean Ly-alpha optical
depths. We find fractional variations in the effective post-reionization
optical depth that are of order unity on a scale of ~100 co-moving Mpc, in
agreement with observations towards high-redshift quasars. Significant
contributions to these variations are provided by the cosmic variance in the
density contrast on the scale of the mean-free-path for ionizing photons, and
by fluctuations in the ionizing background induced by delayed or enhanced
structure formation. Cosmic variance results in a highly asymmetric
distribution of transmission through the IGM, with fractional fluctuations in
Ly-alpha transmission that ar larger than in Ly-beta transmission.

absorption lines. Because many interstellar clouds are probed along this sight
line, possible variations in the properties of individual clouds should be
averaged out. This would yield a deuterium abundance which is characteristic of
the interstellar medium on scales larger than the Local Bubble. We report
D/O=(1.7+/-0.7)e-2 and D/H=(9.8+/-3.8)e-6 (2 sigma). Our new results confirm
that the gas-phase deuterium abundance in the distant interstellar medium is
significantly lower than the one measured within the Local Bubble. We
supplement our study with a revision of the oxygen abundance toward the
moderately distant star Feige 110 (~200 pc). Excluding saturated lines from the
fits of the FUSE spectra is critical; this led us to derive an OI column
density about two times larger than the one previously reported for Feige 110.
The corresponding updated D/O ratio on this sight line is D/O=(2.6+/-1.0)e-2 (2

good proxy for hydrogen within the interstellar medium, this discrepancy is
puzzling. (abstract abridged)

have a more complex morphology than galaxies with other bulge types,

complex, typically containing 3 or more clearly separated regions, including a

we thus propose that galaxies with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin

most likely formed through bar-driven processes while the thick bar arises from

found to show all the key features of a signal from Dark Matter Annihilation
(DMA): a) the excess is observable in all sky directions and has the same shape
everywhere, thus pointing to a common source; b) the shape corresponds to the
expected spectrum of the annihilation of non-relativistic massive particles

the energy spectrum of the excess we deduce a WIMP mass between 50 and 100 GeV,

isothermal profile with substructure in the Galactic plane in the form of

H^{13}CO+(1-0) in the central, innermost part of NGC 2264-C, which we interpret
as the signature of a strong dynamical interaction between two MMSs and their
possible merging with the central MMS C-MM3. Radiative transfer modelling
supports the idea that NGC 2264-C is a highly unstable prolate clump in the
process of collapsing along its long axis on a near free-fall dynamical
timescale ~ 1.7x10^5 yr. Our model fit of this large-scale collapse suggests a
maximum mass inflow rate ~ 3x10^{-3} Msun/yr toward the central protostellar
object C-MM3. Such infall rates are sufficiently high to overcome radiation
pressure and allow the formation of ~ 20 Msun stars by accretion in ~ 1.7x10^5

observe a weak correlation with the average luminosity of the objects. We also
observe in several objects the existence of long-term variability, which seems
decoupled from the short-term one. We interpret the existence of a maximum

AGN are the result of the superimposition of independent events. In the
framework of the so-called discrete-event model, we study the event energy and

their present form, models based on magnetic blobs are also unable to account

stems from the mean field interactions between the condensed atoms. For weak

beating) but remains stable. There exists a critical strength of interactions
beyond which quasiperiodic motion becomes chaotic, resulting in an instability
of the condensate manifested by exponential growth in the number of
noncondensed atoms. In the stable regime, the system remains predominantly in
the two lowest energy states and may be mapped onto a spin model, from which we
obtain an analytic expression for the beat frequency and discuss the route to
instability. We numerically explore parameter regime for the occurrence of
instability and reveal the characteristic density profile for both condensed

to be responsible for the transition to instability. Similar behavior is
observed for dynamically localized states (essentially quasiperiodic motions),

preserve memory of the underlying crystallographic anisotropy, and thus is
ill-suited for problems involving defects or elasticity. The phase field

a magnetic field. Two different cases are considered: (a) when $J$ is
antiferromagnetic and $J^{\prime}$ is ferromagnetic (i.e. the AF-AF-F chain),
the system is a ferrimagnet. The plateaus of the magnetization are observed. It
is found that the width of the plateaus decreases with increasing the
ferromagnetic coupling, and disappears when $% J^{\prime}/J$ passes over a
critical value. The saturated field is observed to be independent of the
ferromagnetic coupling; (b) when $J$ is ferromagnetic and $J^{\prime}$ is
antiferromagnetic (i.e. the F-F-AF chain), the system becomes an
antiferromagnet. The plateaus of the magnetization are also seen. The width of
the plateaus decreases with decreasing the antiferromagnetic coupling, and
disappears when $J^{\prime}/J $ passes over a critical value. Though the ground
state properties are quite different, the magnetization plateaus in both cases
tend to disappear when the ferromagnetic coupling becomes more dominant.
Besides, no fundamental difference between the systems with spin half-integer
and integer has been found.

magnetic dipole in the presence of a magnetic field applied parallel to the
film surfaces are studied theoretically in the London limit. The dipole
magnetic moment is assumed to have constant magnitude and freedom to rotate.
The pinning potential for an arbitrary vortex configuration is calculated
exactly. It is found that, due to the dipole freedom to rotate, the pinning
potential differs significantly from that for a permanent dipole. In
particular, its dependence on the applied field is non-trivial and allows for
tuning of the pinning potential by the applied field. The critical current for
one vortex pinned by the dipole is obtained numerically as a function of the
applied field and found to depend strongly on the field. Order of magnitude
changes in the critical current resulting from changes in the direction and
magnitude of the applied field are reported, with discontinuous changes taking
place in some cases. The effect of vortex pinning by random material defects on
the critical current is investigated using a simple model. It is found that if
random pinning is weak the critical current remains strongly dependent on the
applied field. Possible applications to vortices pinned by arrays of magnetic
dots are briefly considered.

including initialization of object fields and correct use of stateful library
interfaces. Abstract sets with cardinality constraints naturally generalize
typestate properties: relationships between the typestates of objects can be
expressed as subset and disjointness relations on sets, and elements of sets
can be represented as sets of cardinality one. Motivated by these applications,
this paper presents new algorithms and new complexity results for constraints
on sets and their cardinalities. We study several classes of constraints and
demonstrate a trade-off between their expressive power and their complexity.
  Our first result concerns a quantifier-free fragment of Boolean Algebra with
Presburger Arithmetic. We give a nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithm for
reducing the satisfiability of sets with symbolic cardinalities to constraints
on constant cardinalities, and give a polynomial-space algorithm for the
resulting problem.
  In a quest for more efficient fragments, we identify several subclasses of
sets with cardinality constraints whose satisfiability is NP-hard. Finally, we
identify a class of constraints that has polynomial-time satisfiability and
entailment problems and can serve as a foundation for efficient program
analysis.

factorization framework, we analyse this particular decay by using the most
recent data of $BR(B^+ \to \eta K^+)$ and $A_{cp}(B^+ \to \eta K^+)$ available
in the Heavy Flavour Averaging Group (HFAG) webcite. Using these data we
constraint the unitarity angle $\gamma$ and $\eta-\eta'$ mixing angle $\theta$.
We find that such constraint is scale dependent, e.g. for $\gamma = 70^o$, the
data for $BR(B^+ \to \eta K^+)$ (= $(2.6 \pm 0.5)\times 10^{-6}$) suggests that
$\theta$ should lie in between $-46^o$ and $-44^o$, $-30^o$ and $-26^o$ for
$\mu = m_b/2$. For $\mu = m_b$, the same $BR$ data (with the same $\gamma$)
suggests that $\theta$ should lie in between $-54^o$ and $-50^o$, $-30^o$ and
$-26^o$. The allowed region followed from $A_{cp}=-0.25\pm 0.14$, is found to
be rather wider than that obtained from the $BR(B^+ \to \eta K^+)$ data. For
$\gamma=70^o$ and $\theta = -21.3^o$, we find $BR(B^-(+) \to \eta K^-(+))=
2.93(4.91) \times 10^{-6}$ and $A_{cp}=-0.252$ at $\mu=m_b$, and about $
2.98(5.72) \times 10^{-6}$ and -0.315 corresponding to $\mu=m_b/2$. We

perceived to be a thermal bath that heats matter fields on the brane. It is
shown that, aside from being relevant in the early universe, an asymptotic
temperature exists for the brane universe corresponding to late time thermal
equilibrium with the bulk. In the simplest case two possible equilibrium points
exist, one at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature for an asymptotic de Sitter
universe embedded in an Anti-de Sitter bulk and another with a non-zero density

thermal excitations are found to be modified by both the curvature of the bulk

(up to isomorphism) on a given (Gorenstein) del Pezzo surface satisfying
certain properties. We call these bundles {\em almost regular}. In turn, we
study them in families. In this case, the existence and the moduli of these
bundles are governed by the cohomology groups of an abelian sheaf ${\mathscr
A}$: On a given del Pezzo fibration, the existence of an almost regular bundle
depends on the vanishing of an obstruction class in $H^2({\mathscr A})$. In
which case, the set of isomorphism classes of almost regular bundles become a
homogeneous space under the $H^1({\mathscr A})$ action.

structure on stock prices may be obscured by exogenous factors such as demand
and supply, we hypothesize that modulation of the flow of transactions due to
market operations may carry a stronger imprint of the internal market
mechanism. We analyse times between consecutive transactions (ITT) for NYSE and
NASDAQ stocks, and we relate the dynamical properties of the ITT with those of
the corresponding price fluctuations. We find a robust scale-invariant temporal
organisation in the ITT of stocks which is independent of individual company
characteristics and industry sector, but which depends on market structure. We
find that stocks registered on the NASDAQ exhibit stronger correlations in
their transaction timing within a trading day, compared with NYSE stocks.
Further, we find that companies that transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE show
a reduction in the correlation strength of transaction timing within a trading
day, after the move, suggesting influences of market structure. Surprisingly,
we also observe that stronger power-law correlations in the ITT are coupled
with stronger power-law correlations in absolute price returns and higher price
volatility, suggesting a strong link between the dynamical properties of ITT
and the corresponding price fluctuations over a broad range of time scales.
Comparing the NYSE and NASDAQ, we demonstrate that the higher correlations we
find in ITT for NASDAQ stocks are matched by higher correlations in absolute
price returns and by higher volatility, suggesting that market structure may
affect price behaviour through information contained in transaction timing.

recent proven success in many fields including economics. In this work we study
the network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we
compute the inward-outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on
ownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward
investment stock at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the
ownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. Despite the
intuitive value of this approach for EU policy making in economic development,
to our knowledge there are no similar works in the literature yet. In this
paper we focus on statistical distributions and scaling laws of activity,
investment stock and connectivity degree both at the level of firms and at the
level of regions. In particular we find that investment stock of firms is power
law distributed with an exponent very close to the one found for firm activity.
On the other hand investment stock and activity of regions turn out to be
log-normal distributed. At both levels we find scaling laws relating investment
to activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that investment stock
scales with connectivity in a similar way as has been previously found for
stock market data, calling for further investigations on a possible general
scaling law holding true in economical networks.

demonstrate that STRFs measured using a spectrotemporally diverse array of

including the nature and interpretation of measurement errors, is presented
using the Fourier transform, coupled to singular-value decomposition (SVD), and
variability analyses including bootstrap. The results promote the utility of
the STRF as a core functional descriptor of neurons in AI.

if there is already a reasonable prior knowledge in the form of a distribution

to update a prior distribution to a posterior distribution. Here we report on
some work done using the maximum entropy method (ME) as an updating tool.
Specifically, we propose an implementation of the ME method in cases when the

formulated in different ways. Assuming a spatially homogeneous myocyte that is
strictly charge-conservative and electroneutral as a whole, two methods will be
compared: (1) the differential formulation dV/dt=-I/C_m of membrane potential
used traditionally; and (2) the capacitor formulation, where membrane potential
is defined algebraically by the capacitor equation V=Q/C_m. We examine the
relationship between the formulations, assumptions under which each formulation
is consistent, and show that the capacitor formulation provides a transparent,
physically realistic formulation of membrane potential, whereas use of the
differential formulation may introduce unintended and undesirable behavior,
such as monotonic drift of concentrations. We prove that the drift of
concentrations in the differential formulation arises as a compensation for
failure to assign all currents in concentrations. As an example of these
considerations, we present an electroneutral, explicitly charge-conservative
formulation of Winslow et al. model (1999), and extend it to describe membrane
potentials between intracellular compartments.

to be generic in this framework, meaning that they are present in all except
classical theories. These include the non-unique decomposition of a mixed state
into pure states, a theorem involving disturbance of a system on measurement
(suggesting that the possibility of secure key distribution is generic), and a
no-cloning theorem. Two particular theories are then investigated in detail,
for the sake of comparison with the classical and quantum cases. One of these
includes states that can give rise to arbitrary non-signalling correlations,
including the super-quantum correlations that have become known in the
literature as Nonlocal Machines or Popescu-Rohrlich boxes. By investigating
these correlations in the context of a theory with well-defined dynamics, I
hope to make further progress with a question raised by Popescu and Rohrlich,
which is, why does quantum theory not allow these strongly nonlocal
correlations? The existence of such correlations forces much of the dynamics in
this theory to be, in a certain sense, classical, with consequences for
teleportation, cryptography and computation. I also investigate another theory
in which all states are local. Finally, I raise the question of what further
axiom(s) could be added to the framework in order uniquely to identify quantum
theory, and hypothesize that quantum theory is optimal for computation.

is a conserved quantity. It is possible to extend the dynamical law associated
with the evolution of a quantum state consistently to include a nonlinear
stochastic component, while respecting the conservation law. According to the
dynamics thus obtained, referred to as the energy-based stochastic Schrodinger
equation, an arbitrary initial state collapses spontaneously to one of the
energy eigenstates, thus describing the phenomenon of quantum state reduction.
In this article, two such models are investigated: one that achieves state
reduction in infinite time, and the other in finite time. The properties of the
associated energy expectation process and the energy variance process are
worked out in detail. By use of a novel application of a nonlinear filtering
method, closed-form solutions--algebraic in character and involving no
integration--are obtained for both these models. In each case, the solution is
expressed in terms of a random variable representing the terminal energy of the
system, and an independent noise process. With these solutions at hand it is
possible to simulate explicitly the dynamics of the quantum states of
complicated physical systems.
