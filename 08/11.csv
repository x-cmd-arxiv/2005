star clusters using a simplified treatment of stellar dynamics in which the BHs
are assumed to remain concentrated in an inner core, completely decoupled from
the background stars. Dynamical interactions involving BH binaries are computed
exactly and are generated according to a Monte Carlo prescription. Recoil and
ejections lead to complete evaporation of the BH core on a timescale ~10^9 yr
for typical globular cluster parameters. Orbital decay driven by gravitational
radiation can make binaries merge and, in some cases, successive mergers can
lead to significant BH growth. Our highly simplified treatment of the cluster
dynamics allows us to study a large number of models and to compute statistical
distributions of outcomes, such as the probability of massive BH growth and
retention in a cluster. We find that, in most models, there is a significant
probability (~20-80%) of BH growth with final masses > 100 M_{\sun}. In one
case, a final BH formed with mass ~ 620 M_{\sun}. However, if the typical
merger recoil speed (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation)
significantly exceeds the cluster escape speed, no growth ever occurs.
Independent of the recoil speed, we find that BH-BH mergers enhanced by
dynamical interactions in cluster cores present an important source of
gravitational waves for ground--based laser interferometers. Under optimistic
conditions, the total rate of detections by Advanced LIGO, could be as high as
a few tens of events per year from inspiraling BHs from clusters.

Vul and RXJ0806+1527, which are widely thought to be binary white dwarfs of
very short orbital period, 570 and 321 seconds respectively. As such they
should be strong sources of gravitational waves and possible ancestors of the
accreting AM CVn stars. Monitoring at X-ray and optical wavelengths has
established that the period of each star is decreasing, at rates compatible
with that expected from gravitational radiation. This has been taken to support
the ``unipolar inductor'' model in which the white dwarfs are detached and the
X-rays produced by the dissipation of magnetically-induced electric currents.
In this paper we show that this interpretation is incorrect because it ignores
associated torques which transfer angular momentum between the spin of the
magnetic white dwarf and the orbit. We show that this torque is 10^5 times
larger than the GR term in the case of V407 Vul, and 10 times larger for
RXJ0806+1527. For V407 Vul, the unipolar inductor model can only survive if the
white dwarf spins 100 times faster than the orbit. Since this could only come
about through accretion, the validity of the unipolar inductor appears
questionable for this star. We also consider whether accretion models can fit
the observed spin-up, concluding that they can, provided that a mechanism
exists for driving the mass transfer rate away from its equilibrium value.

excellent agreement with previous work. We also investigate the entropy-mass

with the observed empirically-determined entropy-temperature and

Once scaled appropriately, the entropy profiles appear similar beyond ~0.1

gravitational heating (S(r) \propsim r^{1.1}). However, the scatter in scaled
entropy profiles increases with smaller scaled radius, to more than 60 per cent

which boost entropy production at the accretion shock. However, localised
entropy modification may be needed to explain the dispersion in the inner

difficult for the cores of single stars to retain enough angular momentum to
produce a collapsar and gamma-ray burst. At low metallicity, even very massive
stars may retain a massive hydrogen envelope due to the weakness of the stellar
winds, posing an additional obstacle to the collapsar model. Here, we consider
the evolution of massive, magnetic stars where rapid rotation induces almost
chemically homogeneous evolution. We find that in this case, the requirements
of the collapsar model are rather easily fulfilled if the metallicity
sufficiently small: 1) Rapidly rotating helium stars are formed without the
need to remove the hydrogen envelope, avoiding mass-loss induced spin-down. 2)
Angular momentum transport from the helium core to hydrogen envelope by
magnetic torques is insignificant. We demonstrate this by calculating
evolutionary models of massive stars with various metallicities, and derive an
upper metallicity limit for this scenario based on currently proposed mass loss
rates. Our models also suggest the existence of a lower CO-core mass limit of
about 10 Msun -- which relates to an initial mass of only about 20 Msun within
our scenario -- for GRB production. We argue that the relative importance of
the considered GRB progenitor channel, compared to any channel related to
binary stars, may increase with decreasing metallicity, and that this channel
might be the major path to GRBs from first stars.

lies directly behind the apex of an indentation in the eastern X-ray boundary
and (2) lying 1' westward behind the shock, a curved vertical structure (bar)
that is separated from a smaller bright cloud (cap) by faint diffuse emission.
Based on hardness images and spectra, we identify the bar and cap as a single
shocked interstellar cloud. Its morphology strongly resembles the ``voided
sphere'' structures seen at late times in Klein et al.'s experimental
simulations of cloud-shock interactions, when the crushing of the cloud by
shear instabilities is well underway. We infer an interaction time of roughly 3
cloud-crushing timescales, which translates to 2000-4000 years, based on the
X-ray temperature, physical size, and estimated expansion of the shocked cloud.
This is the first X-ray identified example of a cloud-shock interaction in this
advanced phase. Closer to the shock front, the X-ray emission of the compact
knot in the eastern part of the BEK region implies a recent interaction with
relatively denser gas, some of which lies in front of the remnant. The complex
spatial relationship of the X-ray emission of the compact knot to optical [O

along the line of sight.

blue galaxies. We also clearly detect evolution in the VPF with cosmic time,
with voids being larger in comoving units at z~0. We find that the reduced VPF

that differences in the VPF across different galaxy populations are consistent
with being due entirely to differences in the population number density and
\bar{\xi}. The robust result that all galaxy populations follow the negative
binomial model appears to be due to primarily to the clustering of dark matter
halos. The reduced VPF is insensitive to changes in the parameters of the halo
occupation distribution, in the sense that halo models with the same \bar{\xi}
will produce the same VPF. For the wide range of galaxies studied, the VPF

spectra allow us to obtain kinematics out to large radii that are required to
pin down the mass-to-light ratio of the dynamical model and the orbital
structure. The Hubble Space Telescope observations give us a factor of two
better spatial resolution for the surface brightness profile. By fitting
non-parametric, spherical, isotropic models we find a best-fit black hole mass

RXTE data are from a two week follow-up of the source while the Chandra
observation took place around the end of the follow-up, about 12 days after the
discovery of the source, when the source flux had decreased already by a factor
of ten. The analysis of the Chandra data allowed us to extract the most precise
X-ray position of IGR J00291+5934, RA=00 29 03.08 and Dec=+59 34 19.2 (0.6sec

IGR J00291+5934 can be described by a combination of a thermal component and a
power-law. Along the outburst detected by PCA, the power-law photon index shows
no particular trend while the thermal component (~1 keV, interpreted as a hot
spot on the neutron star surface) becomes weaker until non-detection. In the
simultaneous observation of the weak Chandra/RXTE spectrum, there is no more
indication for the ~1 keV thermal component while we detect a colder thermal
component (~0.4 keV) that we interpret as the emission from the cold disc. A
hint for a 6.4 keV iron line is detected, together with an excess around 6.8
keV and absorption feature around 7.1 keV. The latter two features have never
been detected in the spectra of accretion-driven millisecond pulsars before

distance determination from the Hipparcos data, the uncertainties in the
metallicity and age, coupled with the uncertainty in the theoretical models,
lead to a range of predictions on the oscillation frequency spectrum.
Nevertheless, the determination of the ratio between the small separation in
frequency modes, and the large separation as suggested by Roxburgh (2004),
provides a very good measure of the star age, quite independent of the
metallicity in the assumed uncertainty range. In this range, the constraint on
the dynamical mass and the further constraint provided by the assumption that
the maximum age is 14 Gyr limit the mass of 85PegA to the range from 0.75 to
0.82Msun. This difference of a few hundreths of solar masses leads to well
detectable differences both in the evolutionary stage (age) and in the
asteroseismic properties. We show that the age determination which will be
possible through the asteroseismic measurements for this star is independent
either from the convection model adopted or from the microscopic metal
diffusion. The latter conclusion is strengthened by the fact that, although
metal diffusion is still described in an approximate way, recent observations
suggest that the real stars suffer a smaller metal sedimentation with respect
to the models.

spectrum for the cuprates. One likely implication of this universal spectrum is
that stripes of a dynamic form are present in the superconducting samples. On
cooling through the superconducting transition temperature, a gap opens in the
magnetic spectrum, and the weight lost at low energy piles up above the gap;
the transition temperature is correlated with the size of the spin gap.
Depending on the magnitude of the spin gap with respect to the magnetic
spectrum, the enhanced magnetic scattering at low temperature can be either
commensurate or incommensurate. Connections between stripe correlations and

developing a generic quantum Heisenberg-Langevin equation approach leading to a
set of Bloch dynamical equations which describe the nonequilibrium cotunneling
in a convenient and compact way. These equations describe the time evolution of
the spin variables of the QD explicitly in terms of the response and
correlation functions of the free reservoir variables. This scheme not only
provides analytical expressions for the relaxation and decoherence of the
localized spin induced by cotunneling, but it also facilitates evaluations of
the nonequilibrium magnetization, the charge current, and the spin current at

show that cotunneling processes involving electron transfer (both spin-flip and
non-spin-flip) contribute to charge current, while spin-flip cotunneling
processes are required to produce a net spin current in the asymmetric coupling
case. We also point out that under the influence of a nonzero magnetic field,
spin-flip cotunneling is an energy-consuming process requiring a sufficiently
strong external bias-voltage for activation, explaining the behavior of
differential conductance at low temperature: in particular, the splitting of

reflects the average electron spin optically written down in the quantum dot

discuss here in detail a new analytical approach to calculating the
phase-diagram for the Anderson localization in arbitrary spatial dimensions.
The transition from delocalized to localized states is treated as a generalized
diffusion which manifests itself in the divergence of averages of wavefunctions
(correlators). This divergence is controlled by the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma$,
which is the inverse of the localization length, $\xi=1/\gamma$. The appearance
of the generalized diffusion arises due to the instability of a fundamental
mode corresponding to correlators. The generalized diffusion can be described
in terms of signal theory, which operates with the concepts of input and output
signals and the filter function. Delocalized states correspond to bounded
output signals, and localized states to unbounded output signals, respectively.
Transition from bounded to unbounded signals is defined uniquely be the filter
function $H(z)$. Simplifications in the mathematical derivations of the
previous papers (averaging over initial conditions) are shown to be
mathematically rigorous shortcuts.

measuring semantic similarity. LRA measures similarity in the semantic
relations between two pairs of words. When two pairs have a high degree of
relational similarity, they are analogous. For example, the pair cat:meow is
analogous to the pair dog:bark. There is evidence from cognitive science that
relational similarity is fundamental to many cognitive and linguistic tasks
(e.g., analogical reasoning). In the Vector Space Model (VSM) approach to
measuring relational similarity, the similarity between two pairs is calculated
by the cosine of the angle between the vectors that represent the two pairs.
The elements in the vectors are based on the frequencies of manually
constructed patterns in a large corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three
ways: (1) patterns are derived automatically from the corpus, (2) Singular
Value Decomposition is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) synonyms are
used to reformulate word pairs. This paper describes the LRA algorithm and
experimentally compares LRA to VSM on two tasks, answering college-level
multiple-choice word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in
noun-modifier expressions. LRA achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching
human-level performance on the analogy questions and significantly exceeding
VSM performance on both tasks.

universal Turing machines, about which one can state theorems with specific
numerical bounds, rather than include terms like O(1). We present several new

any network of three or more differently oriented interferometers with similar
observing bands is redundant. For LISA, this ``null'' output is known as the
Sagnac mode, and its use in discriminating between detector noise and a
cosmological gravitational wave background is well understood [1][2]. But the

until now. We show that it should make it possible to discriminate in a
model-independent way between real gravitational waves and accidentally
coincident non-Gaussian noise ``events'' in redundant networks of two or more

with three detectors, the null output can be used to locate the direction to

optimal ``coherent'' reconstruction of the two polarization components of the

cosmological milestones. We use these considerations to derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of cosmological milestones such as
bangs, bounces, crunches, rips, sudden singularities, and extremality events.
Since the classification is extremely general, the corresponding results are to
a high degree model-independent: In particular, we provide a complete
characterization of the class of bangs, crunches, and sudden singularities for
which the dominant energy condition is satisfied.

the cross section in the Planck region have a region $(\approx l_{Pl})$ where
the metric signature changes from $\{+,-,-,-,- \}$ to $\{-,-,-,-,+ \}$. The
idea is discussed that such switching can not occur following some general
point of view that the Planck length is the minimal length in the nature and
consequently the physical quantities can not change very quickly in the course
of this length. In this case the dynamic of the $G_{55}$ metric component

Lue and Starkman, of 5 10^-4 arcsec cy^-1 for all the planets of the Solar

which is compatible at 1-sigma level with the observed rate of the Astronomical

of the inner planets of the Solar System are in agreement, at 1-sigma level,
with the predicted value of the Lue-Starkman effect for Mercury and Mars and at

Chern-Simons forms, together with modified tensorial gauge transformations. In
order to define a consistent field strength of a r-rank tensor
B_{\mu_1...\mu_r}^I in the adjoint representation, we need the multiplet
(B_{\mu_1...\mu_r}^I, B_{\mu_1...\mu_{r-1}}^{I J}, ..., B_\mu^{I_1...I_r},
B^{I_1... I_{r+1}}). The usual problem of consistency of the tensor field
equations is circumvented in this formulation.

three different ways: realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials are combined
with model 3N forces (3NF's) or with an effective 3NF resulting from explicit
treatment of the Delta-isobar excitation. Alternatively, the chiral
perturbation theory approach is used at the next-to-next-to-leading order with

loop at one end undergoes unforced diffusion through a narrow pore, we study
the first passage times for a particle, executing one-dimensional brownian
motion in an asymmetric sawtooth potential, to exit one of the boundaries. We
consider the first passage times for the case of classical diffusion,
characterized by a mean-square displacement of the form $< (\Delta x)^2> \sim
t$, and for the case of anomalous diffusion or subdiffusion, characterized by a
mean-square displacement of the form $< (\Delta x)^2> \sim t^{\gamma}$ with
$0<\gamma<1$. In the context of classical diffusion, we obtain an expression
for the mean first passage time and show that this quantity changes when the
direction of the sawtooth is reversed or, equivalently, when the reflecting and
absorbing boundaries are exchanged. We discuss at which numbers of `teeth' $N$
(or number of DNA nucleotides) and at which heights of the sawtooth potential
this difference becomes significant. For large $N$, it is well known that the
mean first passage time scales as $N^2$. In the context of subdiffusion, the
mean first passage time does not exist. Therefore we obtain instead the
distribution of first passage times in the limit of long times. We show that
the prefactor in the power relation for this distribution is simply the
expression for the mean first passage time in classical diffusion. We also
describe a hypothetical experiment to calculate the average of the first
passage times for a fraction of passage events that each end within some time
$t^*$. We show that this average first passage time scales as $N^{2/\gamma}$ in
subdiffusion.

The latter of these two concepts is studied in particular form with a general
optical multiport device, consisting of an arbitrary array of beam-splitters
and phase-shifters. I show how such an apparatus generalizes the original
projection synthesis technique, introduced as an in principle technique to
measure the canonical phase distribution. Just as for the original projection
synthesis, it is found that such a generalised device can synthesize any
general projection onto a state in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. One of
the important findings of this thesis is that, unlike the original projection
synthesis technique, the general apparatus described here only requires a
classical, that is a coherent, reference field at the input of the device. Such
an apparatus lends itself much more readily to practical implementation and
would find applications in measurement and predictive state engineering.
  If we relax the above condition to allow for just a single non-classical
reference field, we show that the apparatus is capable of producing a
single-shot measure of canonical phase. That is, the apparatus can project onto
any one of an arbitrarily large subset of phase eigenstates, with a probability
proportional to the overlap of the phase state and the input field. Unlike the
original projection synthesis proposal, this proposal requires a binomial
reference state as opposed to a reciprocal binomial state. We find that such a
reference state can be obtained, to an excellent approximation, from a suitably
squeezed state.
  The analysis of these measurement apparatuses is performed in the less usual,
but completely rigorous, retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics.
