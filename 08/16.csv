of early X-ray afterglows, including a distinct rapidly decaying component
preceding the conventional afterglow component in many sources, a shallow decay
component before the more ``normal'' decay component observed in a good
fraction of GRBs (e.g. GRB 050128, GRB 050315, GRB 050319, and GRB 050401), and
X-ray flares in nearly half of the afterglows (e.g. GRB 050406, GRB 050502B,
GRB 050607, and GRB 050724). In this paper, we systematically analyze the
possible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X-ray
afterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest
that the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the
prompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the X-ray flares. This provides clear
evidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinct
components, supporting the internal origin of the GRB prompt emission. The
shallow decay segment observed in a group of GRBs suggests that the forward
shock keeps being refreshed for some time. This might be caused either by a
long-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell Lorentz
factors, or else by the deceleration of a Poynting flux dominated flow. X-ray
flares suggest that the GRB central engine is still active after the prompt
gamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times. In some
cases, the central engine activity even extends days after the burst trigger.
Analyses of early X-ray afterglow data reveal that GRBs are indeed highly
relativistic events. Early afterglow data of many bursts, starting from the
beginning of the XRT observations, are consistent with the afterglow emission
from an interstellar medium (ISM) environment.

0.6 kpc. There is a pronounced north-south asymmetry in source counts for |l| <
30 degrees, with ~ 25% more stars in the north. For l=10-30 degrees, there is a
strong enhancement of stars of m= 11.5-13.5 mag. A linear bar passing through
the Galactic center with half-length R_bar=4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc, tilted by phi=44

Galactic spiral structure. Total source counts are depressed in regions where
the counts of red objects (m_K-m_[8.0] >3) peak. In these areas, the counts are

However, the specific angular momentum distribution of molecular gas in NGC

We also consider the evidence for star formation activity and disk growth in

of the HD 98800 B subsystem. Our orbit model calls for an inclination of 66.8

allows for comparison with PMS models in the low-mass regime with few empirical
constraints. Solar abundance models seem to under-predict the inferred
component temperatures and luminosities, while assuming slightly sub-solar

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT). The
early X-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadly
consists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay
(t^{-alpha} with 3<alpha_1<5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay
(0.2<alpha_2<0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1<alpha_3<1.5).
These power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,
300s<t_{break,1}<500s and 10^3s<t_{break,2}<10^4s. On top of this canonical
behavior of the early X-ray light curve, many events have superimposed X-ray
flares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lasting
sporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the GRB. We
find that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of the
prompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to our
line of sight. The first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes place
when the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallow
flux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into the
external shock. When this energy injection stops, a second break is then
observed in the light curve (t_{break,2}). This energy injection increases the
energy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f>4, and augments the
already severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-ray
emission.

steep t^{-3.0 \pm 0.3} decay until ~400 s, followed by a significantly slower
t^{-0.65+/-0.20} fall-off, which at 0.2--2 d after the burst evolves into a
t^{-1.7+/-0.5} decay. We consider three possible models for the geometry of
relativistic blast-waves (spherical outflows, non-spreading jets, and spreading
jets), two possible dynamical regimes for the forward shock (adiabatic and
fully radiative), and we take into account a possible angular structure of the
outflow and delayed energy injection in the blast-wave, to identify the models
which reconcile the X-ray light-curve decay with the slope of the X-ray
continuum for each of the above three afterglow phases. By piecing together the
various models for each phase in a way that makes physical sense, we identify
possible models for the entire X-ray afterglow. The major conclusion of this
work is that a long-lived episode of energy injection in the blast-wave, during
which the shock energy increases at t^{1.0+/-0.5}, is required for five
afterglows and could be at work in the other four as well. Optical observations
in conjunction with the X-ray can distinguish among these various models. Our
simple tests allow the determination of the location of the cooling frequency
relative to the X-ray domain and, thus, of the index of the electron power-law
distribution with energy in the blast-wave. The resulting indices are clearly
inconsistent with an universal value.

This polarization will furthermore vary as the occultation progresses. We

Comptonization of ~ 0.3 keV soft photons by a plasma with kT_e ~ 20 keV and an
optical depth of about 2.6 (interpreted as emission from the accretion disk

discovered evidence for a neutral Fe K\alpha emission line, and we found
interstellar Fe L_II and Fe L_III absorption features. The burst spectrum can
be fit by fixing the disk Comptonization parameters to the persistent emission
best-fit values, and adding a blackbody. The blackbody/seed photon temperature
at the peak of the burst is ~ 1.8 keV and returns to ~ 0.8 keV over 200 s. The
blackbody radius is consistent with R_bb = 10.3-11.7 km assuming a distance of

two electron populations which dominate the emission at different frequencies.
Our radio observations (Anupama & Kantharia 2005) of the remnant of GK Persei

at a considerable height above the accretion disk in such systems. Our
three-dimensional numerical modeling demonstrates that a thickening of the halo
above the disk can appear even in the absence of a direct collision between the
stream and the disk. In the gas-dynamical flow pattern described with the
""hot-line"" model, a considerable fraction of the matter is accelerated in the
vertical direction during the flow's interaction with the circumdisk halo. The
vertical motion of the gas due to the presence of the z component of the
velocity leads to a gradual thickening of the circumdisk halo. The computations
reveal the strongest thickening of the halo above the outer edge of the disk at
phases ~0.7, in agreement with observations for stationary-disk cataclysmic
variables. This supports the hot-line model suggested earlier as a description
of the pattern of the matter flows in semi-detached binaries, and presents new

around a star increases with the star's metallicity. Our latest simulations of
disks undergoing gravitational instabilities (GIs) with realistic radiative
cooling indicate that protoplanetary disks with lower metallicity generally
cool faster and thus show stronger overall GI-activity. More importantly, the
global cooling times in our simulations are too long for disk fragmentation to
occur, and the disks do not fragment into dense protoplanetary clumps. Our
results suggest that direct gas giant planet formation via disk instabilities
is unlikely to be the mechanism that produced most observed planets.
Nevertheless, GIs may still play an important role in a hybrid scenario,
compatible with the observed metallicity trend, where structure created by GIs
accelerates planet formation by core accretion.

AM1.5G, and the other curves with a light source, having a different spectral
emission. The fitting of all current-voltage curves simultaneously, not
individually, permit us to determine the photogenerated current of three
junctions. It is necessary to have three characteristics or more. An example,
with experimental current-voltage data points, is shown in this work. The main
advantage of this new technique is its simplicity and its easy implementation
at any laboratory with an electrical characterization solar cell system and a
solar simulator. The method has been tested over a large quantity of TJ solar
cells.

distinguishes between granular friction and inter-particle friction, and uses
the former without providing a physical mechanism. Albert, {\em et al.} [2]
analyzed the geometric stability of grains on a pile's surface. The
frictionless model for dry particles is in excellent agreement with experiment.
But, their model for wet grains overestimates stability and predicts no
dependence on system size. Using the frictionless model and performing
stability analysis within the pile, we reproduce the dependence of the
stability angle on system size, particle size, and surface tension observed in
our experiments. Additionally, we account for past discrepancies in
experimental reports by showing that sidewalls can significantly increase the

of magnetic flux through the SQUID loop is observed. This is an unambiguous

  appear in FOCS 2005",,,,"cs.CC cs.DM math.PR",,"  We prove that for any decision tree calculating a boolean function
$f:\{-1,1\}^n\to\{-1,1\}$, \[ \Var[f] \le \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i \Inf_i(f), \]
where $\delta_i$ is the probability that the $i$th input variable is read and
$\Inf_i(f)$ is the influence of the $i$th variable on $f$. The variance,
influence and probability are taken with respect to an arbitrary product
measure on $\{-1,1\}^n$. It follows that the minimum depth of a decision tree
calculating a given balanced function is at least the reciprocal of the largest
influence of any input variable. Likewise, any balanced boolean function with a
decision tree of depth $d$ has a variable with influence at least
$\frac{1}{d}$. The only previous nontrivial lower bound known was $\Omega(d
2^{-d})$. Our inequality has many generalizations, allowing us to prove
influence lower bounds for randomized decision trees, decision trees on
arbitrary product probability spaces, and decision trees with non-boolean
outputs. As an application of our results we give a very easy proof that the
randomized query complexity of nontrivial monotone graph properties is at least
$\Omega(v^{4/3}/p^{1/3})$, where $v$ is the number of vertices and $p \leq
\half$ is the critical threshold probability. This supersedes the milestone
$\Omega(v^{4/3})$ bound of Hajnal and is sometimes superior to the best known
lower bounds of Chakrabarti-Khot and Friedgut-Kahn-Wigderson.

  with Application to Puncturing","35 pages, 1 figure. Submitted to IEEE Trans. on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  This paper considers the achievable rates and decoding complexity of
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over statistically independent parallel
channels. The paper starts with the derivation of bounds on the conditional
entropy of the transmitted codeword given the received sequence at the output
of the parallel channels; the component channels are considered to be
memoryless, binary-input, and output-symmetric (MBIOS). These results serve for
the derivation of an upper bound on the achievable rates of ensembles of LDPC
codes under optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding when their transmission
takes place over parallel MBIOS channels. The paper relies on the latter bound
for obtaining upper bounds on the achievable rates of ensembles of randomly and
intentionally punctured LDPC codes over MBIOS channels. The paper also provides
a lower bound on the decoding complexity (per iteration) of ensembles of LDPC
codes under message-passing iterative decoding over parallel MBIOS channels;
the bound is given in terms of the gap between the rate of these codes for
which reliable communication is achievable and the channel capacity. The paper
presents a diagram which shows interconnections between the theorems introduced
in this paper and some other previously reported results. The setting which
serves for the derivation of the bounds on the achievable rates and decoding
complexity is general, and the bounds can be applied to other scenarios which
can be treated as different forms of communication over parallel channels.

But what physical cause governs the time-evolution of gyroscope axes? We
consider linear perturbations of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with
k=0. We ask: Will cosmological vorticity perturbations exactly drag the spin
axes of gyroscopes relative to the directions of geodesics to quasars in the
asymptotic unperturbed FRW space? Using Cartan's formalism with local
orthonormal bases we cast the laws of linear cosmological gravitomagnetism into
a form showing the close correspondence with the laws of ordinary magnetism.
Our results, valid for any equation of state for cosmological matter, are: 1)
The dragging of a gyroscope axis by rotational perturbations of matter beyond
the Hubble-dot radius from the gyroscope is exponentially suppressed, where dot
is the derivative with respect to cosmic time. 2) If the perturbation of matter
is a homogeneous rotation inside some radius around a gyroscope, then exact
dragging of the gyroscope axis by the rotational perturbation is reached
exponentially fast as the rotation radius grows beyond the H-dot radius. 3) For
the most general linear cosmological perturbations the time-evolution of all
gyroscope spin axes exactly follow a weighted average of the energy currents of
cosmological matter. The weight function is the same as in Ampere's law except
that the inverse square law is replaced by the Yukawa force with the Hubble-dot
cutoff. Our results demonstrate (in first order perturbation theory for FRW
cosmologies with k = 0) the validity of Mach's hypothesis that axes of local
non-rotating frames precisely follow an average of the motion of cosmic matter.

classified as ``pure'' flavor or mass effects, where the appearance of such a

distinguished from other non-standard effects (such as neutrino decoherence and

compare with bulk two-point functions computed in asymptotically AdS_3

limit), and sufficiently small time separation, a typical Ramond ground state
of vanishing R-charge has the M=0 BTZ black hole as its effective description.
At large time separation this effective description breaks down. The CFT
correlators we compute take over, and give a response whose details depend on
the microstate. We also discuss typical states with nonzero R-charge, and argue
that the effective geometry should be a singular black ring. Our results

Although the radius is not stabilized, there is nothing wrong with the
resultant RS II model, because it is not only phenomenologically viable but
also free from the gauge hierarchy problem thanks to its supersymmetric
extension.

is analogous to the corresponding speculations in special relativity. The
formulas for the velocity transformation when one pass from one inertial frame
to another are obtained. In case when both velocities are directed along one of
the three selected straight lines, the obtained relations coincide with the
analogous relations of special relativity, but they differ in other cases.
Besides, the expressions for the transformations that play the same role as
Lorentz transformations in the Minkowski space are obtained. It was found that
if the three space coordinate axis are straight lines along which the
velocities are added as in special relativity, then taking the velocity of the
new inertial frame collinear to the one of these coordinate axis, one can see
that the transformation of this coordinate and time coordinate coincide with
Lorentz transformations, while the transformations of the two transversal

classification and regression. In its original and computationally flexible
version, boosting seeks to minimize empirically a loss function in a greedy
fashion. The resulting estimator takes an additive function form and is built
iteratively by applying a base estimator (or learner) to updated samples
depending on the previous iterations. An unusual regularization technique,
early stopping, is employed based on CV or a test set. This paper studies
numerical convergence, consistency and statistical rates of convergence of
boosting with early stopping, when it is carried out over the linear span of a
family of basis functions. For general loss functions, we prove the convergence
of boosting's greedy optimization to the infinimum of the loss function over
the linear span. Using the numerical convergence result, we find early-stopping
strategies under which boosting is shown to be consistent based on i.i.d.
samples, and we obtain bounds on the rates of convergence for boosting
estimators. Simulation studies are also presented to illustrate the relevance
of our theoretical results for providing insights to practical aspects of
boosting. As a side product, these results also reveal the importance of
restricting the greedy search step-sizes, as known in practice through the work
of Friedman and others. Moreover, our results lead to a rigorous proof that for

methodology. In comparison with existing sufficient dimension reduction
techniques, this contour-based methodology guarantees exhaustive estimation of
the central subspace under ellipticity of the predictor distribution and mild
additional assumptions, while maintaining \sqrtn-consistency and computational
ease. Moreover, it proves robust to departures from ellipticity. We establish
population properties for both SCR and GCR, and asymptotic properties for SCR.

Many variable selection techniques may be implemented by maximum penalized
likelihood using various penalty functions. Optimizing the penalized likelihood
function is often challenging because it may be nondifferentiable and/or
nonconcave. This article proposes a new class of algorithms for finding a
maximizer of the penalized likelihood for a broad class of penalty functions.
These algorithms operate by perturbing the penalty function slightly to render
it differentiable, then optimizing this differentiable function using a
minorize-maximize (MM) algorithm. MM algorithms are useful extensions of the
well-known class of EM algorithms, a fact that allows us to analyze the local
and global convergence of the proposed algorithm using some of the techniques
employed for EM algorithms. In particular, we prove that when our MM algorithms
converge, they must converge to a desirable point; we also discuss conditions
under which this convergence may be guaranteed. We exploit the
Newton-Raphson-like aspect of these algorithms to propose a sandwich estimator
for the standard errors of the estimators. Our method performs well in
numerical tests.

out using the posterior median, this is a random thresholding procedure; the
estimation can also be carried out using other thresholding rules with the same
threshold. Details of the calculations needed for implementing the procedure
are included. In practice, the estimates are quick to compute and there is
software available. Simulations on the standard model functions show excellent
performance, and applications to data drawn from various fields of application
are used to explore the practical performance of the approach. By using a
general result on the risk of the corresponding marginal maximum likelihood
approach for a single sequence, overall bounds on the risk of the method are
found subject to membership of the unknown function in one of a wide range of
Besov classes, covering also the case of f of bounded variation. The rates
obtained are optimal for any value of the parameter p in (0,\infty],
simultaneously for a wide range of loss functions, each dominating the L_q norm
of the \sigmath derivative, with \sigma\ge0 and 0<q\le2.

Poisson disintegration method is based on the formal statement of two results
concerning a Laplace functional change of measure and a Poisson Palm/Fubini
calculus in terms of random partitions of the integers {1,...,n}. The
techniques are analogous to, but much more general than, techniques for the
Dirichlet process and weighted gamma process developed in [Ann. Statist. 12

posterior analysis of classes of discrete random probability which identifies
and exploits features common to all these models. The analysis circumvents many
of the difficult issues involved in Bayesian nonparametric calculus, including
a combinatorial component. This allows one to focus on the unique features of
each process which are characterized via real valued functions h. The
applicability of the technique is further illustrated by obtaining explicit
posterior expressions for L\'evy-Cox moving average processes within the

the autoregressive representation in order to form innovation proxies. This is
relevant also when the innovation density is parameterized, and we provide a

implementation is that it naturally incorporates a loss detection mechanism
that makes the probability of a gate introducing a non-detected error, when
non-ideal detectors are considered, dependent only on the detector dark-count
rate and independent of its efficiency. Since very low dark-count rate
detectors are currently available, a high-fidelity gate (probability of error
of order $10^{-6}$ conditional on the gate being successful) can be implemented
using polarization encoding. The detector efficiency determines the overall
success probability of the gate but does not affect its fidelity. This can be
applied to the efficient construction of optical cluster states with very high
fidelity for quantum computing.

resonant light pulses that are short (4 ns) compared with the lifetime of the

observe an adjustable number of Rabi oscillations, followed by free decay once
the light is switched off. To generate the pulses we have developed a novel
laser system based on frequency doubling a telecoms laser diode at 1560 nm. By
setting the laser intensity to make a pi-pulse, we use this coherent control to
make a high quality triggered source of single photons. We obtain an average
single photon rate of 9600 s-1 at the detector. Measurements of the
second-order temporal correlation function show almost perfect antibunching at
zero delay. In addition, we present preliminary results on the use of Raman
transitions to couple the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of our
trapped atom. This will allow us to prepare and control a qubit formed by two
hyperfine sub-levels.
