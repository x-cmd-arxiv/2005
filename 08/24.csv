range of cosmological models are testable than ever before. However, an
important distinction must be made between parameter fitting and model
selection. While parameter fitting simply determines how well a model fits the
data, model selection statistics, such as the Bayesian Evidence, are now
necessary to choose between these different models, and in particular to assess
the need for new parameters. We implement a new evidence algorithm known as
nested sampling, which combines accuracy, generality of application and
computational feasibility, and apply it to some cosmological datasets and
models. We find that a five-parameter model with Harrison-Zel'dovich initial
spectrum is currently preferred.

globular clusters containing both UV-bright stars and radio pulsars, one can
measure column densities of HI and several metal ions using UV absorption
measurements and of H II using radio dispersion measurements, thereby
minimizing ionization uncertainties. We apply this method to the globular
cluster Messier 3 sight line using FUSE and HST ultraviolet spectroscopy of the
post-asymptotic giant branch star von Zeipel 1128 and radio observations by
Ransom et al. of millisecond pulsars. Ionized hydrogen is 45+/-5% of the total
along this sight line, the highest measured fraction along a high-latitude
pulsar sight line. We derive total gas-phase abundances log N(S)/N(H) =
-4.87+/-0.03 and log N(Fe)/N(H) = -5.27+/-0.05. Our derived sulfur abundance is
in excellent agreement with recent solar system determinations of Asplund,
Grevesse, & Sauval, but -0.14 dex below the solar system abundance typically
adopted in studies of the ISM. The iron abundance is ~-0.7 dex below the solar
system abundance, consistent with significant depletion. Abundance estimates
derived by simply comparing S II and Fe II to H I are +0.17 and +0.11 dex
higher, respectively, than our measurements. Ionization corrections to the
gas-phase abundances measured in the standard way are, therefore, significant
compared with the measurement uncertainties along this sight line. The
systematic uncertainties associated with the uncertain contribution to the
electron column density from ionized helium could raise these abundances by
<+0.03 dex (+7%). [Abridged]

examined. Its applicability to observed frequencies of rotating gamma Doradus
stars is discussed taking into account the following aspects: the use of a
perturbative approach to compute adiabatic oscillation frequencies; the effect
of rotation on the observational Brunt-Vaisala integral determination and
finally, the problem of disentangling multiplet-like structures from frequency
patterns due to the period spacing expected for high-order gravity modes in
asymptotic regime. This analysis reveals that the FRM produces reliable results
for objects with rotational velocities up to 70 kms/s, for which the FRM
intrinsic error increases one order of magnitude with respect to the typical
FRM errors given in Moya et al. (2005). Our computations suggest that, given
the spherical degree ""l"" identification, the FRM may be discriminating for m =
0 modes, in the sense that the method avoids any misinterpretation induced by
the presence of rotationally split multiplet-like structures, which reinforces
the robustness of the method. However, if ""l"" is unknown, such discrimination
is not ensured. In order to check the FRM in presence of slow-moderate
rotation, we have applied it to the three observed frequencies of the slowly
rotating (vsini = 29 km/s) gamma Doradus star HD48501.

out variability caused by stellar rotation and rotation of structures within

isochrones in V/V-i' CMDs, and thus has little influence on apparent age

atmospheric windows from about 200 to 900 GHz. In 1996, the Academica Sinica
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics of Taiwan joined the project and agreed
to provide additional hardware to expand the interferometer to eight elements.
All eight antennas are now operating at the observatory site on Mauna Kea, and
astronomical observations have been made in the 230, 345, and 650 GHz bands.
  The SMA antennas have a diameter of 6 m, a surface accuracy of better than 25
micron rms, and can be reconfigured to provide spatial resolutions down to
about 0.5"" at 200 GHz and, eventually, 0.1"" at 850 GHz. Coupling to the
receiver package within each antenna is achieved via a beam waveguide, in a
bent Nasmyth configuration, comprised of a flat tertiary mirror and two
ellipsoidal mirrors that form a secondary pupil used for receiver calibration.
An additional fixed mirror and a rotating wire grid polarizer are then used for
receiver selection. Each antenna houses a single cryostat, with an integrated
cryocooler capable of cooling up to eight receivers to 4 K. In the current
configuration only three receiver bands are available: 175-255 GHz, 250-350
GHz, and 600-720 GHz, and simultaneous operation of the 650 GHz receiver with
either of the lower frequency receivers is possible. Eventually dual
polarization will be available from 325-350 GHz, and dual frequency operation
will be possible, pairing either of the lower frequency receivers with any of
the high frequency units: 325-425 GHz, 425-510 GHz, 600-720 GHz, and 800-900

overcoming the `last parsec' problem and allowing the most massive black hole

disks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower mass binaries detectable
with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), then there may be a purely
gravitational wave signature of the role of gas in the form of a small but
finite eccentricity just prior to merger. Numerical simulations suggest that
eccentricity, excited by the interaction between the binary and surrounding gas
disk, is only partially damped during the final phase of gravitational
radiation-driven inspiral. We estimate that the typical eccentricity at one
week prior to coalescence is of the order of 0.01. Higher terminal
eccentricities, which can approach 0.1, are possible if the binary has an
extreme mass ratio. The detection of even a small eccentricity prior to merger
by LISA provides a possible discriminant between gas-driven inspirals and those
effected by stellar processes.

ago within 1 kpc from Earth. Relativistic shocks from GRBs are assumed to
inject power-law distributions of cosmic rays (CRs) to the highest energies.
Diffusive propagation of CRs from the local GRB explains the CR spectrum near

are explained as being directly connected with the injection of plasma
turbulence in the interstellar medium on a ~1 pc and ~100 pc scales,

origin of the ankle in the CR spectrum at E ~ 4*10^{18} eV is due to photopair

Berezinsky and collaborators. Any significant excess flux of extremely high

magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a collisionless plasma. Collisionless
effects may be important in radiatively inefficient accretion flows, such as
near the black hole in the Galactic Center. The MHD version of ZEUS is modified
to evolve an anisotropic pressure tensor. A fluid closure approximation is used
to calculate heat conduction along magnetic field lines. The anisotropic
pressure tensor provides a qualitatively new mechanism for transporting angular
momentum in accretion flows (in addition to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses).
We estimate limits on the pressure anisotropy due to pitch angle scattering by
kinetic instabilities. Such instabilities provide an effective ``collision''
rate in a collisionless plasma and lead to more MHD-like dynamics. We find that
the MRI leads to efficient growth of the magnetic field in a collisionless
plasma, with saturation amplitudes comparable to those in MHD. In the saturated
state, the anisotropic stress is comparable to the Maxwell stress, implying
that the rate of angular momentum transport may be moderately enhanced in a
collisionless plasma.

presence of the gaps causes strong small-scale fluctuations in inclination,
azimuth angle and field strength, but without strong forces acting on the gas.
The field is nearly horizontal in a region around the cusp-shaped top of the
gap, thereby providing an environment for Evershed flows. We identify this
region with the recently discovered dark penumbral cores. Its darkness has the
same cause as the dark lanes in umbral light-bridges, reproduced in numerical
simulations by Nordlund and Stein (2005). We predict that the large vertical
and horizontal gradients of the magnetic field inclination and azimuth in the
potential field model will produce the net circular polarization seen in
observations. The model also explains the significant elevation of bright
filaments above their surroundings. It predicts that dark areas in the penumbra
are of two different kinds: dark filament cores containing the most inclined

microarcsecond level of precision makes the non-uniformity of the galactic
motion of the barycenter an observable effect that violates the inertiality of
the barycentric frame. Most of the observable effect is caused by secular
acceleration of the barycenter with respect to the center of the Galaxy. The
acceleration results in a pattern of secular aberration which is observable
astrometrically as a systematic vector field of the proper motions of distant
quasars. We employ the vector spherical harmonics to describe the predicted
field of the proper motions and evaluate its amplitude at each point on the
celestial sphere. It is shown that the pattern of secular aberration is fully
represented by three low-order electric-type vector harmonics, and hence, it is
easily distinguishable from the residual rotations of the reference frame and
other possible effects, such as the hypothetical long-period gravitational
waves. Comprehensive numerical simulations of the grid astrometry with SIM
PlanetQuest are conducted. The full covariance matrix of the simulated grid
solution is used to evaluate the covariances of the three electric harmonic
coefficients, representing the secular aberration pattern of proper motions. We
conclude that the grid astrometry with SIM PlanetQuest will be sensitive to the

emission from the underlying disk. In previous studies, oversimplified X-ray
photon sources are often assumed above the disk in order to compute the iron

the accretion energy is dominantly dissipated in the corona, in which X-ray

one-to-one correspondence with the halo mass at a given redshift, and that of
the associated $\kappa$-peak from simulations. For halos with the same expected

present, one describes the decay of the fluctuations in the temperature and the

the gas has reached local equilibrium, there exist large fluctuations in an
intensive parameter (temperature) which break the thermodynamic equilibrium
with the heat bath. Thus the decay of the fluctuations in the intensive
parameter is larger than the characteristic time for the establishment of local
equilibrium. We show that the dynamics of such large and intensive fluctuations
may be described by adopting a nonequilibrium thermodynamics approach with an
adequate formulation of local equilibrium. A coarsening procedure is then used
to contract the space of mesoscopic variables needed to describe the dynamics

procedure allows us to derive an effective Maxwell-Boltzmann factor (EMBF) for
the Brownian gas, as has been recently proposed in the literature. Furthermore,
we use this local equilibrium distribution and an entropy functional to derive

bulk contributions to the second harmonic generation (SHG) reflected from the
neat air/water interface, as well as common liquid interfaces. Because there
has been no general methodology to determine the quadrupolar and bulk
contributions to the SHG signal from a liquid interface, this conclusion was
reached based on the following two experimental phenomena. Namely, the broken
of the macroscopic Kleinman symmetry, and the significant temperature
dependence of the SHG signal from the neat air/water interface. However,
because sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) measurement
of the neat air/water interface observed no apparent temperature dependence,
the temperature dependence in the SHG measurement has been reexamined and
proven to be an experimental artifact. Here we present a complete microscopic
analysis of the susceptibility tensors of the air/water interface, and show
that dipolar contribution alone can be used to address the issue of broken of
the macroscopic Kleinman symmetry at the neat air/water interface. Using this
analysis, the orientation of the water molecules at the interface can be
obtained, and it is consistent with the measurement from SFG-VS. Therefore, the
key rationales to conclude significantly quadrupolar and bulk contributions to
the SHG signal of the neat air/water interface can no longer be considered as
valid as before. This new understanding of the air/water interface can shed
light on our understanding of the nonlinear optical responses from other

Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy (SFG-VS). Quantitative polarization and
experimental configuration analysis of the SFG data in different polarizations
with four sets of experimental configurations can shed new lights on our

the motion of the interfacial water molecules can only be in a limited angular
range, instead rapidly varying over a broad angular range in the vibrational
relaxation time suggested previously. Secondly, because different vibrational
modes of different molecular species at the interface has different symmetry
properties, polarization and symmetry analysis of the SFG-VS spectral features
can help assignment of the SFG-VS spectra peaks to different interfacial
species. These analysis concluded that the narrow 3693cm-1 and broad 3550cm-1
peaks belong to C_ v symmetry, while the broad 3250cm-1 and 3450cm-1 peaks
belong to the symmetric stretching modes with C_2v symmetry. Thus, the 3693cm-1
peak is assigned to the free OH, the 3550cm-1 peak is assigned to the single
hydrogen bonded OH stretching mode, and the 3250cm-1 and 3450cm-1 peaks are
assigned to interfacial water molecules as two hydrogen donors for hydrogen
bonding (with C_2v symmetry), respectively. Thirdly, analysis of the SFG-VS
spectra concluded that the singly hydrogen bonded water molecules at the

iterative decoding, computer vision and combinatorial optimization which
involve graphs with many cycles, theoretical results about both correctness and
convergence of the algorithm are known in few cases (Weiss-Freeman Wainwright,
Yeddidia-Weiss-Freeman, Richardson-Urbanke}.
  In this paper we consider the problem of finding the Maximum Weight Matching
(MWM) in a weighted complete bipartite graph. We define a probability
distribution on the bipartite graph whose MAP assignment corresponds to the
MWM. We use the max-product algorithm for finding the MAP of this distribution
or equivalently, the MWM on the bipartite graph. Even though the underlying
bipartite graph has many short cycles, we find that surprisingly, the
max-product algorithm always converges to the correct MAP assignment as long as
the MAP assignment is unique. We provide a bound on the number of iterations
required by the algorithm and evaluate the computational cost of the algorithm.
We find that for a graph of size $n$, the computational cost of the algorithm
scales as $O(n^3)$, which is the same as the computational cost of the best
known algorithm. Finally, we establish the precise relation between the
max-product algorithm and the celebrated {\em auction} algorithm proposed by
Bertsekas. This suggests possible connections between dual algorithm and
max-product algorithm for discrete optimization problems.

reasoning approach that is able, unlike other approaches, to both prove or
disprove likely invariants. In the latter case, our approach provides
counter-examples. We illustrate the approach on a motivating example where
automatically generated likely invariants are verified.

software. But the level of expertise required of practitioners of these
techniques prohibits their widespread adoption. Formal techniques need to be
tailored to the commercial software developer. Alloy is a lightweight
specification language supported by the Alloy Analyzer (AA), a tool based on
off-the-shelf SAT technology. The tool allows a user to check interactively
whether given properties are consistent or valid with respect to a high-level
specification, providing an environment in which the correctness of such a
specification may be established. However, Alloy is not particularly suited to
expressing program specifications and the feedback provided by AA can be
misleading where the specification under analysis or the property being checked
contains inconsistencies. In this paper, we address these two shortcomings.
Firstly, we present a lightweight language called ""Loy"", tailored to the
specification of object-oriented programs. An encoding of Loy into Alloy is
provided so that AA can be used for automated analysis of Loy program
specifications. Secondly, we present some ""patterns of analysis"" that guide a
developer through the analysis of a Loy specification in order to establish its
correctness before implementation.

four separate sum rules. The sum rule with the scalar-scalar current gives a
stable value for the $D_s$ mass which qualitatively agrees with the
experimental value, and the result is not sensitive to the continuum threshold.
The vector-vector sum rule also gives a stable result with small sensitivity to
the continuum threshold and the extracted mass is somewhat lower than the
scalar-scalar current value. On the other hand, the two sum rules in the
pseudoscalar and axial-vector channels are found to yield the mass highly
sensitive to the continuum threshold, which implies that a four-quark state
with the combination of pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar or axial-vector--axial-vector

the giant gravitons in the LLM geometry behave like the quasi-holes in those

arise in this context, by studying the dynamics of giant graviton probes in a
special LLM geometry, the AdS_5 X S^5 background, that corresponds to a
circular droplet. The giant gravitons we study are D3-branes wrapping on a
3-sphere in S^5. Their low energy world-volume theory, truncated to the 1/2 BPS
sector, is shown to be described by a Chern-Simons finite-matrix model. We
demonstrate that these giant gravitons may condense at right density further
into fractional quantum Hall fluid due to the repulsive interaction in the
model, giving rise to the new states in IIB string theory. Some features of the
novel physics of these new states are discussed.

at the Hawking temperature T_{sem} in the early evaporation and the new string

in the quantum string regime. The last state of evaporation of a semiclassical
KNbh is a string state of temperature T_s, mass M_s, J = 0 = Q, decaying as a
quantum string into all kinds of particles.(There is naturally, no loss of
information, (no paradox at all)). We compute the microscopic string entropy
S_s(m, j) of mass m and spin mode j. (Besides the usual transition at T_s), we
find for high j, (extremal string states) a new phase transition at a

transition operates and the whole entropy S_{sem} is drastically different from

Morse potential determined from resonance data itself, are reexamined in the
light of the recent development of the two new methods for identification of
resonances in the scattering theory, namely Imaginary Test Potential and
Imaginary Phase-shift methods. The high lying resonances are found to be not
genuine as pointed out by Kato and Abe, and as such are discarded. This
discomfiture is due to the (i) shallow behavior of the Morse potential at the
outer edge and (ii) inappropriate insertion of Coulomb tail used in that work.
These two deficiencies are now removed in the present study by finding a
modified Morse potential with steep rise in the outer edge, and joining
smoothly to it a term approximating the Coulomb tail. Calculation of the
resonances for this modified Morse potential using the above two methods of
identification of resonances in our study, yields more than 25 states with
angular momenta $0^{+}$ - $12^{+}$ in the relevant energy regions. This
reaffirms the diatomic-like rotational and vibrational picture of the nuclear
molecular resonances in $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C system proposed earlier, and shows
close resemblance with the physics of diatomic molecules, a phenomenon
belonging to altogether a different area. It is revealing that the similarity
extends right upto the level of potential which is Morse type in both the
cases. This study also reveals new features of heavy ion potential.

completely determined by specifying correlations between measurements performed
on subsystems only. Despite the fact that the quantum correlations thus suffice
to reconstruct the quantum state, we show, using a Bell inequality argument,
that they cannot be regarded as objective local properties of the composite
system in question. It is well known since the work of J.S. Bell, that one
cannot have locally preexistent values for all physical quantities, whether
they are deterministic or stochastic. The Bell inequality argument we present
here shows this is also impossible for correlations among subsystems of an
individual isolated composite system. Neither of them can be used to build up a
world consisting of some local realistic structure. As a corrolary to the
result we argue that entanglement cannot be considered ontologically robust.
The argument has an important advantage over others because it does not need
perfect correlations but only statistical correlations. It can therefore easily
be tested in currently feasible experiments using four particle entanglement.

Our purification protocol relies on only linear optics and an ancilla vacuum
state, rendering this approach an interesting alternative to the more complex
protocols of entanglement distillation and quantum error correction.

  Proceedings ""ERATO Conference on Quantum Information Science 2005"" (Tokyo,
  26-30 August 2005)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The no-go theorem of unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment depends
crucially on the assumption that Alice knows in detail all the probability
distributions generated by Bob. We show that if a protocol is concealing, then
the cheating unitary transformation is independent of any parameters (including
probability distributions) secretly chosen by Bob, so that Alice can calculate
it without knowing Bob's secret choices. Otherwise the protocol cannot be
concealing. Our result shows that the original impossibility proof was based on
an incorrect assumption, despite the fact that its conclusion remains valid
within the adopted framework. Furthermore, our result eliminates a potential
loophole in the no-go theorem.

$\ket{\Psi}$ is shared by $n$ players and $m$ controllers, where $\ket{\Psi}$
is the encoding state of a quantum secret sharing scheme. The players may be
considered as field agents responsible for carrying out a task, using the
secret information encrypted in $\ket{\Psi}$, while the controllers are
superiors who decide if and when the task should be carried out and who to do
it. Our protocol only requires ancillary Bell states and Bell-basis
measurements.

single-particle measurements. In the present experiment, we have performed a
Bell experiment on three particles in which one of the measurements corresponds
to a projection onto a maximally-entangled state. We show theoretically and
experimentally, that correlations between these entangled measurements and
single-particle measurements are too strong for any local-realistic theory and
are experimentally exploited to violate a CHSH-Bell inequality by more than 5
standard deviations. We refer to this possibility as ""entangled entanglement"".
