galaxies as functions of galaxy luminosity and environment. The evolution of
these relationships over the redshift range of z~0.5 to z~0.05 is analysed in
combination with published results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find
that there is a strong evolution in the restframe peak color of bright blue
galaxies in that they become redder with decreasing redshift, while the colors
of faint blue galaxies remain approximately constant. This effect supports the
``downsizing'' scenario of star formation in galaxies. While the general
dependence of the galaxy color distributions on the environment is small, we
find that the change of red galaxy fraction with epoch is a function of the
local galaxy density, suggesting that the downsizing effect may operate with
different timescales in regions of different galaxy densities.

Chandra} X-ray images, implies a source of energy in the galactic nucleus. In
some elliptical galaxies faint X-ray ``ghost'' cavities appear without
corresponding radio lobes. It has been suggested that ghost cavities are caused
by short-lived activity with a timescale of $\sim 10^3-10^4$ years, but this is
difficult to understand within the popular paradigm of active galactic nuclei.
We suggest an episode model for ghost cavities, invoking captures of red giant
stars by the black hole located at the center of the elliptical galaxies at a
typical rate of $10^{-5}$yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. The accretion of tidally
disrupted red giant stars onto the black hole powers activity in a timescale of
a few years. The total energy channeled into the jet/outflow during the cooling
time of the hot gas is $\sim 10^{56}$ erg, which is the typical work required
to form the observed cavities. In this scenario, the faint cavities are
produced by the feedback following accretion of the debris of the captured red
giant stars onto the black holes. We apply the present model to several
elliptical galaxies and find that it can explain the formation of the ghost
cavities. This model can be tested in the future by comparisons between radio
and X-ray observations.

of the M81 group dwarf galaxy IC 2574 obtained as part of the Spitzer Infrared

a kinematically distinct HI shell, with an associated remnant stellar cluster;
the shell is initiating sequential star formation as it interacts with the
surrounding interstellar medium. This region dominates the infrared luminosity
of IC 2574 and is spatially resolved in all Spitzer imaging bands. We study the
differences in dust temperature as a function of local environment and compare
local star formation rates as inferred from H Alpha and total infrared
luminosities. We find that the strong H Alpha sources are associated with
regions of warm dust; however, the most luminous infrared and H Alpha sources
are not necessarilyco-spatial. The coolest dust is found in the regions
farthest from the rim of the shell; these regions show the best agreement
between star formation rates derived from H Alpha and from total infrared
luminosities (although discrepancies at the factor of 3-4 level still exist).
There is considerable variation in the radio-far infrared correlation in
different regions surrounding the shell. The low dust content of the region may
influence the scatter seen in these relations; these data demonstrate that the
expanding shell is dramatically affecting its surroundings by triggering star
formation and altering the dust temperature.

the surfaces of dust grains. Hydrogen molecules play a role in gas-phase
reactions that produce other molecules, some of which serve as coolants during
gravitational collapse and star formation. Thus, the evaluation of the
roduction rate of hydrogen molecules and its dependence on the physical
conditions in the cloud are of great importance. Interstellar dust grains
exhibit a broad size distribution in which the small grains capture most of the
surface area. Recent studies have shown that the production efficiency strongly
depends on the grain composition and temperature as well as on its size. In
this paper we present a formula which provides the total production rate of
H$_2$ per unit volume in the cloud, taking into account the grain composition
and temperature as well as the grain size distribution. The formula agrees very
well with the master equation results. It shows that for a physically relevant
range of grain temperatures, the production rate of H$_2$ is significantly
enhanced due to their broad size distribution.

M83 based on ISOCAM data. M83 is a unique case study, since a wide variety of
MIR broad-band filters as well as spectra, covering the wavelength range of 4
to 18\mu m, were observed and are presented here. Emission maxima trace the
nuclear and bulge area, star-formation regions at the end of the bar, as well
as the inner spiral arms. The fainter outer spiral arms and interarm regions
are also evident in the MIR map. Spectral imaging of the central 3'x3' (4 kpc x
4 kpc) field allows us to investigate five regions of different environments.
The various MIR components (very small grains, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) molecules, ionic lines) are analyzed for different regions throughout the
galaxy. In the total 4\mu m to 18\mu m wavelength range, the PAHs dominate the
luminosity, contributing between 60% in the nuclear and bulge regions and 90%
in the less active, interarm regions. Throughout the galaxy, the underlying
continuum emission from the small grains is always a smaller contribution in
the total MIR wavelength regime, peaking in the nuclear and bulge components.
The implications of using broad-band filters only to characterize the
mid-infrared emission of galaxies, a commonly used ISOCAM observation mode, are
discussed. We present the first quantitative analysis of new H-alpha and 6cm
VLA+Effelsberg radio continuum maps of M83. The distribution of the MIR
emission is compared with that of the CO, HI, R band, H-alpha and 6cm radio. A
striking correlation is found between the intensities in the two mid-infrared
filter bands and the 6cm radio continuum. To explain the tight
mid-infrared-radio correlation we propose the anchoring of magnetic field lines
in the photoionized shells of gas clouds.

Short period variables (P < 0.4 d) can have modulation period as short as some
days, while longer period variables (P > 0.6 d) always exhibit modulation with
P_mod > 20 d. We interpret this tendency with the equality of the modulation
period with the surface rotation period, because similar distribution of the
rotational periods is expected if an upper limit of the total angular momentum
of stars leaving the RGB exists. The distribution of the projected rotational
velocities of red and blue horizontal branch stars at different temperatures

extragalactic background radiation across the e.m. spectrum. Our calculations
rely on deep Blazar radio counts that we derived combining several
multifrequency surveys. The integrated Blazar emission yields a broad-band
non-thermal background that in some parts of the e.m. spectrum dominates the
extragalactic brightness. Blazars are the main point-like contributors to the
CMB. Their integrated emission causes an apparent T increase of 5-50 muK in the
50-250 GHz range. The CMB fluctuation spectrum is sensibly contaminated at
l>300, for a Poissonian source distribution, or at lower l values if spatial
clustering is present. We estimate that well over 100,000 Blazars will produce
a significant signal in the PLANCK CMB anisotropy maps. Because of the
microwave-Xray flux correlation, these sources are expected to have flux > a
few 10^{-15} erg/s in the soft X-ray band. Thus, a large fraction of the
foreground sources in CMB anisotropy maps could be identified and removed using
a multi frequency approach, provided that a sufficiently deep all sky X-ray
survey will be available. We further show that Blazars are a major constituent
of all high-E extragalactic backgrounds. Their contribution is 11-12% at X-ray
frequencies and possibly 100% in the 0.5-50 MeV band. At E>100 MeV, the Blazar
collective emission, obtained extrapolating their integrated micro-wave flux to
the gamma-ray band using the SED of EGRET detected sources, over-predicts the
extragalactic background by a large factor, implying that Blazars not only
dominate the gamma-ray sky but also that their average duty cycle at these
frequencies must be rather low. We also find that Blazars of the HBL type may

died down. The picture at earlier times will be more difficult to reconstruct,

dust was formed, and quasars were a vigorously rising population. One of the

however deeply buried in gas and dust they may be. But to understand fully the
astrophysical context of these objects, their significance in the grand
picture, we must learn how they relate to their environments and their host
galaxies. The ESA future Far-InfraRed Mission (FIRM) will provide much of the

described by Navier-Stokes and convection-diffusion equations with pressure
tensor and chemical potential derived by the Brazovskii free-energy. Our
simulations are based on a mixed numerical method with Lattice Boltzmann
equation and finite difference scheme for Navier-Stokes and order parameter
equations, respectively. We focus on cases where banded flows are observed with
two different slopes for the component of velocity in the direction of the
applied flow. Close to the walls the system reaches a lamellar order with very
few defects and the slope of the horizontal velocity is higher than the imposed
shear rate. In the middle of the system the local shear rate is lower than the
imposed one and the system looks as a mixture of tilted lamellae, droplets and
small elongated domains. We refer to this as to a region with a Shear Induced
Structures (SIS) configuration. The local behavior of the stress shows that the
system with the coexisting lamellar and SIS regions is in mechanical
equilibrium. This phenomenon occurs, at fixed viscosity, for shear rates under
a certain threshold; when the imposed shear rate is sufficiently large,
lamellar order develops in the whole system. Effects of different viscosities
have been also considered: The SIS region is observed only at low enough
viscosity. We compare the above scenario with the usual one of shear banding.
In particular, we do not find evidence for a plateau of the stress at varying
imposed shear rates in the region with banded flow. We interpret our results as
due to a tendency of the lamellar system to oppose to the presence of the
applied flow.

this analysis demonstrates the internal consistency and accuracy of the
scattering functions obtained at finite concentrations. We find that Laponite

short range but repulsive on longer range. This finding demonstrates that
Laponite solutions exhibit only a limited stability at the concentration of
added salt used herein. Raising the ionic strength to 0.005 mM already leads to
slow flocculation as is evidenced from the enhanced scattering intensity at

$\Delta p_c \sim \frac{p_c}{l}$, where $l \sim N^{\nu_{opt}}$ is the average
length of the percolation cluster, and $N$ is the number of nodes in the
network. For Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graphs $\nu_{opt} = 1/3$, while for
scale-free (SF) networks with a degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$
and $3<\lambda<4$, $\nu_{opt} = (\lambda-3)/(\lambda-1)$. We show analytically
and numerically that the \textit{survivability} $S(p,l)$, which is the
probability of a cluster to survive $l$ chemical shells at probability $p$,
behaves near criticality as $S(p,l) = S(p_c,l) \cdot exp[(p-p_c)l/p_c]$. Thus
for probabilities inside the region $|p-p_c| < p_c/l$ the behavior of the
system is indistinguishable from that of the critical point.

  509-538.",,,"cs.LO",,"  This paper describes a simpler way for programmers to reason about the
correctness of their code. The study of semantics of logic programs has shown
strong links between the model theoretic semantics (truth and falsity of atoms
in the programmer's interpretation of a program), procedural semantics (for
example, SLD resolution) and fixpoint semantics (which is useful for program
analysis and alternative execution mechanisms). Most of this work assumes that
intended interpretations are two-valued: a ground atom is true (and should
succeed according to the procedural semantics) or false (and should not
succeed). In reality, intended interpretations are less precise. Programmers
consider that some atoms ""should not occur"" or are ""ill-typed"" or
""inadmissible"". Programmers don't know and don't care whether such atoms
succeed. In this paper we propose a three-valued semantics for (essentially)
pure Prolog programs with (ground) negation as failure which reflects this. The
semantics of Fitting is similar but only associates the third truth value with
non-termination. We provide tools to reason about correctness of programs
without the need for unnatural precision or undue restrictions on programming
style. As well as theoretical results, we provide a programmer-oriented
synopsis. This work has come out of work on declarative debugging, where it has
been recognised that inadmissible calls are important. This paper has been

3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ is found to be well described by the Coulomb plus Y-type linear
potential (Y-Ansatz) within 1%-level deviation. As a clear evidence for
Y-Ansatz, Y-type flux-tube formation is actually observed on the lattice in
maximally-Abelian projected QCD. For about 100 patterns of 3Q systems, we
perform the accurate calculation for the 1st excited-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm
3Q}^{\rm e.s.}$ by diagonalizing the QCD Hamiltonian in the presence of three
quarks, and find a large gluonic-excitation energy $\Delta E_{\rm 3Q} \equiv
V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}-V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ of about 1 GeV, which gives a
physical reason of the success of the quark model. $\Delta E_{\rm 3Q}$ is found
to be reproduced by the ``inverse Mercedes Ansatz'', which indicates a
complicated bulk excitation for the gluonic-excitation mode. We study also the
tetra-quark and the penta-quark potentials in lattice QCD, and find that they
are well described by the OGE Coulomb plus multi-Y type linear potential, which
supports the flux-tube picture even for the multi-quarks.

version most commonly used in anthropic reasoning, makes no physical
predictions unless supplemented by a further assumption of ""typicality"", and we
argue that this assumption is both misguided and unjustified. WAP_1, however,
requires no such supplementation; it directly implies that any theory that
assigns a non-zero probability to our universe predicts that we will observe
our universe with probability one. We argue, therefore, that WAP_1 is
preferable, and note that it has the benefit of avoiding the inductive
overreach characteristic of much anthropic reasoning.

characterized by some structure functions. Such a linear truncation is
explicitly realized by introducing the notion of Forsyth frame over the Riemann
surface with the help of a conformally covariant algebraic differential
equation. The large chiral diffeomorphism action is then implemented through a
B.R.S. formulation (for a given order of truncation) leading to a more
algebraic set up. In this context the ghost fields behave as holomorphically
covariant jets. Subsequently, the link with the so called W-algebras is made
explicit once the ghost parameters are turned from jets into tensorial ghost
ones. We give a general solution with the help of the structure functions
pertaining to all the possible truncations lower or equal to the given order.

numerically stable computation of subspaces evolving according to the

obtained by representing subspaces as single exterior products
\cite{AS,Br.1,Br.2,BrZ,BDG}. For large systems, however, the dimension of the

where $n$ is the dimension of the system written as a first-order ODE and $k$
(typically $\sim n/2$) is the dimension of the subspace. We resolve this
difficulty by the introduction of a simple polar coordinate algorithm
representing ``pure'' (monomial) products as scalar multiples of orthonormal
bases, for which the angular equation is a numerically optimized version of the
continuous orthogonalization method of Drury--Davey \cite{Da,Dr} and the radial

noetherian local ring $R$ with residue field $k$: the stable cohomology modules
$\hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k)$, defined for each $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ by Benson and
Carlson, Mislin, and Vogel; it coincides with Tate cohomology when $R$ is
Gorenstein. It is proved that important properties of $R$, such as being
regular, complete intersection, or Gorenstein, are detected by the $k$-rank of
$\hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k)$ for an arbitrary $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Such numerical
characterizations are made possible by results on the structure of
$\mathbb{Z}$-graded $k$-algebra carried by $\hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k)$. It is proved
that in many cases this algebra is determined by the absolute cohomology
algebra through a canonical homomorphism
${Ext}^{n}_R(k,k)\to\hat{Ext}^{n}_R(k,k)$.

finite volume hyperbolic structure. (Equivalently, O is the quotient of
hyperbolic 3-space by a lattice in PSL(2,C) with torsion.) Then we prove that O
has a tower of finite-sheeted covers {O_i} with linear growth of p-homology,
for some prime p. This means that the dimension of the first homology, with mod
p coefficients, of the fundamental group of O_i grows linearly in the covering
degree. The proof combines techniques from 3-manifold theory with
group-theoretic methods, including the Golod-Shafarevich inequality and results
about p-adic analytic pro-p groups.
  This has several consequences. Firstly, the fundamental group of O has at
least exponential subgroup growth. Secondly, the covers {O_i} have positive
Heegaard gradient. Thirdly, we use it to show that a group-theoretic conjecture
of Lubotzky and Zelmanov would imply that O has large fundamental group. This
implication uses a new theorem of the author, which will appear in a
forthcoming paper. These results all provide strong evidence for the conjecture
that any closed orientable hyperbolic 3-orbifold with non-empty singular locus

of rumor spreading on complex networks, and use analytical and numerical
solutions of these equations to examine the threshold behavior and dynamics of
the model on random graphs, uncorrelated scale-free networks and scale-free

networks and random graphs the model exhibits a critical threshold in the rumor
spreading rate below which a rumor cannot propagate in the system. In the case
of scale-free networks, on the other hand, this threshold becomes vanishingly
small in the limit of infinite system size. We find that the initial rate at
which a rumor spreads is much higher in scale-free networks than in random
graphs, and that the rate at which the spreading proceeds on scale-free
networks is further increased when assortative degree correlations are
introduced. The impact of degree correlations on the final fraction of nodes
that ever hears a rumor, however, depends on the interplay between network
topology and the rumor spreading rate. Our results show that scale-free
networks are prone to the spreading of rumors, just as they are to the
spreading of infections. They are relevant to the spreading dynamics of chain

very little is known about its biology outside the laboratory. Especially, its
unusual mode of reproduction with self-fertile hermaphrodites and facultative
males raises the question of its frequency of outcrossing in natural
populations. Results: We describe the first analysis of C. elegans individuals
sampled directly from natural populations. C. elegans is found predominantly in
the dauer stage and with a very low frequency of males compared with
hermaphrodites. While C. elegans was previously shown to display a low
worldwide genetic diversity, we find by comparison a surprisingly high local
genetic diversity of C. elegans populations; this local diversity is
contributed in great part by immigration of new alleles rather than by
mutation. Our results on heterozygote frequency, male frequency and linkage
disequilibrium furthermore show that selfing is the predominant mode of
reproduction in C. elegans natural populations, yet that infrequent outcrossing
events occur, at a rate of approximately 1%. Conclusions: Our results give a
first insight in the biology of C. elegans in the natural populations. They

the postulate of equal {\it a priori} probability in quantum statistical
mechanics. This modification, called the {\it quantum microcanonical postulate}
(QMP), asserts that for a system in microcanonical equilibrium all pure quantum
states having the same energy expectation value are realised with equal
probability. A simple model of a quantum system that obeys the QMP and that has
a nondegenerate spectrum with equally spaced energy eigenvalues is studied.
This model admits a closed-form expression for the density of states in terms
of the energy eigenvalues. It is shown that in the limit as the number of
energy levels approaches infinity, the expression for the density of states
converges to a $\delta$ function centred at the intermediate value $(E_{\rm
max}+E_{\rm min})/ 2$ of the energy. Determining this limit requires an
elaborate asymptotic study of an infinite sum whose terms alternate in sign.

Prata pointed out that, surprisingly, its stationary-state Wigner function does
not obey the naive equation of motion, i.e. the naive stargenvalue (*-genvalue)
equation. We review our recent work on this problem, that treats the infinite
wall as the limit of a Liouville potential. Also included are some new results:
(i) we show explicitly that the Wigner-Weyl transform of the usual density
matrix is the physical solution, (ii) we prove that an effective-mass treatment
of the problem is equivalent to the Liouville one, and (iii) we point out that
self-adjointness of the operator Hamiltonian requires a boundary potential, but
one different from that proposed by Dias and Prata.

  Journal of Geometric Methods in Modern Physics","Int.J.Geom.Meth.Mod.Phys. 3(2006) 269-283",,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  In the paper (math-ph/0504049) Jarlskog gave an interesting simple
parametrization to unitary matrices, which was essentially the canonical
coordinate of the second kind in the Lie group theory (math-ph/0505047).
  In this paper we apply the method to a quantum computation based on
multi-level system (qudit theory). Namely, by considering that the
parametrization gives a complete set of modules in qudit theory, we construct
the generalized Pauli matrices which play a central role in the theory and also
make a comment on the exchange gate of two-qudit systems.
  Moreover we give an explicit construction to the generalized Walsh-Hadamard
matrix in the case of n=3, 4 and 5. For the case of n=5 its calculation is
relatively complicated. In general, a calculation to construct it tends to
become more and more complicated as n becomes large.
  To perform a quantum computation the generalized Walsh-Hadamard matrix must
be constructed in a quick and clean manner. From our construction it may be
possible to say that a qudit theory with $n\geq 5$ is not realistic.
  This paper is an introduction towards Quantum Engineering.

PCE, the dissipation of photon field and the pure dephasing of the input atoms.
As a result we find that (I) the PCE can work well to some extent even in the
existence of the cavity loss (photon dissipation); and (II) the short-time
atomic dephasing, which can destroy the PCE, is a fatal problem to be overcome.
