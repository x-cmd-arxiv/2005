not been unambiguously experimentally detected. The reason being that in the

better known ways to detect it is by using the magnetic field symmetry
properties of the rectified and pumped currents. The rectified currents are
symmetric with respect to magnetic field reversal while the pumped currents do
not possess any definite symmetry with respect to field reversal. This feature
has been exploited in some recent works. In this work we look beyond this
magnetic field symmetry properties and provide examples wherein the nature or
magnitudes of the pumped and rectified currents are exactly opposite enabling
an effective distinction between the two.

we explore a section of the phase diagram in the three-dimensional parameter

body-centered-cubic (bcc) phases is compared within the two models. As function
of an increasing electric field, the distorted bcc region in the phase diagram
shrinks and disappears above a triple point, at which the lamellar, hexagonal

$L_{kj}$'s are linear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\lambda_k$'s are real

multipole representations of polynomial and analytic functions on other
quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$, real and complex. Over the complex
numbers, the above representation is not unique, although the ambiguity is
essentially finite. We investigate the combinatorics that depicts this
ambiguity. We link these results with some classical theorems of harmonic
analysis, theorems that describe decompositions of functions into sums of
spherical harmonics. We extend these classical theorems (which rely on our
understanding of the Laplace operator $\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general
differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are constructed with the help of the
quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce modular spaces of multipoles. We
study their intricate geometry and topology using methods of algebraic geometry

Calabi-Yau threefold. The middle cohomology of the threefold is shown to
contain a piece coming from a pair of elliptic surfaces. The resulting quotient
is a two-dimensional Galois representation. By using the Lefschetz fixed-point
theorem in \'etale cohomology and counting points on the variety over finite
fields, this Galois representation is shown to be modular.

Ann. 341 (2008), no. 1, 1--13","10.1007/s00208-007-0178-z",,"math.SP math.SG",,"  We consider Riemannian metrics compatible with the natural symplectic
structure on T^2 x M, where T^2 is a symplectic 2-Torus and M is a closed
symplectic manifold. To each such metric we attach the corresponding Laplacian
and consider its first positive eigenvalue \lambda_1. We show that \lambda_1
can be made arbitrarily large by deforming the metric structure, keeping the
symplectic structure fixed. The conjecture is that the same is true for any
symplectic manifold of dimension >= 4. We reduce the general conjecture to a
purely symplectic question.

boundary problem for this graph amounts to describing coherent random
permutations with descent-set statistic, and is also related to certain
positive characters on the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions. We establish
connections to some further relatives of Young's lattice and solve the boundary
problem by reducing it to the classification of spreadable total orders on
integers, as recently obtained by Jacka and Warren.

propagation, one based on the van-Vleck propagator, the other on phase-space
path integration. Leading quantum corrections to the classical Liouville
propagator take the form of a time-dependent quantum spot. Its oscillatory
structure depends on whether the underlying classical flow is elliptic or
hyperbolic. It can be interpreted as the result of interference of a
\emph{pair} of classical trajectories, indicating how quantum coherences are to
be propagated semiclassically in phase space. The phase-space path-integral
approach allows for a finer resolution of the quantum spot in terms of Airy
functions.
