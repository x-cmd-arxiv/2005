characterize bound cores - including their masses, radii, mean densities,
angular momenta, spins, magnetizations, and mass-to-flux ratios. We also
present line maps of our models that can be compared with observations. Our
simulations range between 5-30 Jeans masses of gas, and are representative of
molecular cloud clumps with masses between 100-1000 solar masses. The cores
have mass-to-flux ratios that are generally less than that of the original
cloud, and so a cloud that is initially highly supercritical can produce cores
that are slightly supercritical, similar to that seen by Zeeman measurements of
molecular cloud cores. Clouds that are initially only slightly supercritical
will instead collapse along the field lines into sheets, and the cores that
form as these sheets fragment have a different mass spectrum than what is
observed. The spin rates of these cores suggests that subsequent fragmentation
into multiple systems is likely. The sizes of the bound cores that are produced
are typically 0.02-0.2 pc and have densities in the range 10^4-10^5 cm^{-3} in
agreement with observational surveys. Finally, our numerical data allow us to
test theoretical models of the mass spectrum of cores, such as the turbulent
fragmentation picture of Padoan-Nordlund. We find that while this model gets
the shape of the core mass spectrum reasonably well, it fails to predict the

uncertainties present within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging survey
based on repeat observations of approximately 200 square degrees of the sky. We
show that, for the standard SDSS aperture systems (petrocounts, counts_model,
psfcounts and cmodel_counts), the errors generated by the SDSS photometric
pipeline under-estimate the observed scatter in the individual bands. The
degree of disagreement is a strong function of aperture and magnitude (ranging
from 20% to more than a factor of 2). We also find that the photometry in the
five optical bands can be highly correlated for both point sources and
galaxies, although the correlation for point sources is almost entirely due to
variable objects. Without correcting for this covariance the SDSS color errors
could be in over-estimated by a factor of two to three. Combining these
opposing effects, the SDSS errors on the colors differ from the observed color
variation by approximately 10-20% for most apertures and magnitudes. We provide
a prescription to correct the errors derived from the SDSS photometric pipeline
as a function of magnitude and a semi-analytic method for generating the
appropriate covariance between the different photometric passbands. Given the
intrinsic nature of these correlations, we expect that all current and future
multi-band surveys will also observe strongly covariant magnitudes. The ability
of these surveys to complete their science goals is largely dependent on
color-based target selection and photometric redshifts; these results show the
importance of spending a significant fraction of early survey operations on
re-imaging to empirically determine the photometric covariance of any

several $\gamma$-ray bursts. It is a major breakthrough for understanding the
nature of the progenitors. It is proposed that the X-ray emission lines can be
well explained by the Geometry-Dominated models, but in these models the
illuminating angle is much larger than that of the collimated jet of the
$\gamma$-ray bursts(GRBs). For GRB 011211, we obtain the illuminating angle is
about $\theta\sim45^{\circ}$, while the angle of GRB jet is only $3.6^{\circ}$,
so we propose that the outflow of the GRBs with emission lines should have two
distinct components. The wide component illuminates the reprocessing material,
and produces the emission lines, while the narrow one produces the $\gamma$-ray
bursts. The observations show that the energy for producing the emission lines
is higher than that of the GRBs. In this case, when the wide component
dominates the afterglows, a bump will appear in the GRBs afterglows. For GRB
011211, the emergence time of the bump is less than 0.05 days after the GRB, it
is obviously too early for the observation to catch it. With the presence of
the X-ray emission lines there should also be a bright emission component
between the UV and the soft X-rays. These features can be tested by the $Swift$
satellite in the near future.

on the all-sky catalogue ASCC-2.5 (I/280A) compiled from Tycho-2, Hipparcos and
other catalogues. The sample of optical clusters from ASCC-2.5 is complete up
to about 850 pc from the Sun. The symmetry plane of the clusters' distribution
is determined to be at $Z_0=-22\pm4$ pc, and the scale height of open clusters
is only $56\pm3$ pc. The total surface density and volume density in the
symmetry plane are $\Sigma=$ 114 kpc$^{-2}$ and $D(Z_0)=1015$ kpc$^{-3}$,
respectively. We find the total number of open clusters in the Galactic disk to
be of order of 10$^5$ at present. Fluctuations in the spatial and velocity
distributions are attributed to the existence of four open cluster complexes
(OCCs) of different ages containing up to a few tens of clusters. Members in an
OCC show the same kinematic behaviour, and a narrow age spread. We find, that
the youngest cluster complex, OCC~1 ($\log t<7.9$), with 19 deg inclination to
the Galactic plane, is apparently a signature of Gould's Belt. The most
abundant OCC~2 complex has moderate age ($\log t\approx8.45$). The clusters of
the Perseus-Auriga group, having the same age as OCC~2, but different
kinematics are seen in breaks between Perseus-Auriga clouds. The oldest ($\log
t\approx8.85$) and sparsest group was identified due to a large motion in the
Galactic anticentre direction. Formation rate and lifetime of open clusters are
found to be $0.23\pm0.03$ kpc$^{-2}$Myr$^{-1}$ and 322$\pm$31 Myr,
respectively. This implies a total number of cluster generations in the history
of the Galaxy between 30 to 40. We estimate that less than about 10% of the
total Galactic stellar disk population has ever passed an open cluster
membership.

more feasible with the combination of developments for the James Webb Space

developed a preliminary but comprehensive mission concept for SAFIR, as a 10
m-class far-infrared and submillimeter observatory that would begin development
later in this decade to meet the needs outlined above. Its operating
temperature (<4K) and instrument complement would be optimized to reach the
natural sky confusion limit in the far-infrared with diffraction-limited
peformance down to at least 40 microns. This would provide a point source
sensitivity improvement of several orders of magnitude over that of Spitzer or
Herschel, with finer angular resolution, enabling imaging and spectroscopic
studies of individual galaxies in the early universe. We have considered many
aspects of the SAFIR mission, including the telescope technology, detector
needs and technologies, cooling method and required technology developments,
attitude and pointing, power systems, launch vehicle, and mission operations.
The most challenging requirements for this mission are operating temperature
and aperture size of the telescope, and the development of detector arrays.

high-quality single crystals of Bi2212 and Tl2201 are used to probe the
relaxation time of nodal quasiparticles in the d-wave superconducting state
through a two-fluid analysis of the microwave conductivity. While this analysis
requires us to posit a form for the frequency-dependent quasiparticle
conductivity, we clearly demonstrate that the extraction of the relaxation rate
is quite insensitive to the assumed shape of the quasiparticle spectrum. The
robustness of the analysis is rooted in the oscillator-strength sum rule and
the fact that we simultaneously measure the real and imaginary parts of the
conductivity. In both Bi2212 and Tl2201 we infer a linear temperature
dependence of the transport relaxation rate 1/tau and a small but finite
zero-temperature intercept. The linear temperature dependence of 1/tau is in
accord with expectations for weak elastic scattering in an unconventional
superconductor with line nodes and a small residual density of states. The same
analysis reveals an onset of inelastic scattering at higher temperatures
similar to that seen in the YBCO superconductors. Finally we extrapolate the
two-fluid model over a range of frequencies up to five times the measurement

similar to terahertz conductivity data on Bi2212 thin films. While relaxation
rates in Bi2212 and Tl2201 are substantially higher than in YBCO there are
qualitative similarities between all three materials, and the differences can

conclude that a universal picture of quasiparticle scattering in the cuprates

quantum turbulence provides a simpler prototype of turbulence than classical
turbulence. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and statistics of
quantized vortices in quantum turbulence by numerically solving a modified
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. First, to make decaying turbulence, we introduce a
dissipation term that works only at scales below the healing length. Second, to
obtain steady turbulence through the balance between injection and decay, we
add energy injection at large scales. The energy spectrum is quantitatively
consistent with the Kolmogorov law in both decaying and steady turbulence.
Consequently, this is the first study that confirms the inertial range of
quantum turbulence.

central-charge deficit Q^2, in which target time is identified with (the
world-sheet zero mode of the) Liouville field: Q-Cosmology. We use a specific
example of colliding brane worlds to illustrate the phase diagram of this
cosmological framework. The collision provides the necessary initial
cosmological instability, expressed as a departure from conformal invariance in
the underlying string model. The brane motion provides a way of breaking
target-space supersymmetry, and leads to various phases of the brane and bulk
Universes. Specifically, we find a hot metastable phase for the bulk string
Universe soon after the brane collision in which supersymmetry is broken, which
we describe by means of a subcritical world-sheet sigma model dressed by a
space-like Liouville field, representing finite temperature (Euclidean time).
This phase is followed by an inflationary phase for the brane Universe, in
which the bulk string excitations are cold. This is described by a
super-critical Liouville string with a time-like Liouville mode, whose zero
mode is identified with the Minkowski target time. Finally, we speculate on
possible ways of exiting the inflationary phase, either by means of subsequent
collisions or by deceleration of the brane Universe due to closed-string
radiation from the brane to the bulk. While phase transitions from hot to cold
configurations occur in the bulk string universe, stringy excitations attached
to the brane world remain thermalized throughout, at a temperature which can be
relatively high. The late-time behaviour of the model results in
dilaton-dominated dark energy and present-day acceleration of the expansion of
the Universe, asymptoting eventually to zero.

the TM-modes have in addition a bound state, namely, the surface plasmon. This
analysis relies on the consideration of the scattering problem in the TE- and

constructed for different branches of the spectrum in an explicit form. As a
preliminary, the rigorous procedure of integration over the continuous spectra
is formulated by introducing the spectral densityin terms of the scattering
phase shifts. The asymptotic expansion of the integrated heat kernel at small

(A)dS$_{d+1}/Z_p$. In the AdS case their energy is negative relative to that of
pure AdS. We present perturbative evidence in 5 dimensions that such metrics

these solutions have a cosmological horizon. We show that their mass at future

at intermediate energies as an indirect method in nuclear astrophysics. These
are peripheral processes, therefore we can extract asymptotic normalization
coefficients (ANC) from which reaction rates of astrophysical interest can be
inferred. To show the usefulness of the method, three different cases are
discussed. In the first, existing experimental data for the breakup of 8B at
energies from 30 to 1000 MeV/u and of 9C at 285 MeV/u on light through heavy
targets are analyzed. Glauber model calculations in the eikonal approximation
and in the optical limit using different effective interactions give
consistent, though slightly different results, showing the limits of the
precision of the method. The results lead to the astrophysical factor
S_17(0)=18.7+/-1.9 eVb for the key reaction for solar neutrino production
7Be(p,\gamma)8B. It is consistent with the values from other indirect methods
and most direct measurements, but one. Breakup reactions can be measured with
radioactive beams as weak as a few particles per second, and therefore can be
used for cases where no direct measurements or other indirect methods for
nuclear astrophysics can be applied. We discuss a proposed use of the breakup
of the proton drip line nucleus 23Al to obtain spectroscopic information and
the stellar reaction rate for 22Mg(p,\gamma)23Al.

standard exact 3-dimensional lattice model we evolve sequences starting from

Acceptance of mutations is biased to select for stable proteins. We found that
certain structures, wonderfold, are independently discovered numerous times as
native states of stable proteins in many unrelated runs of selection. Diversity
of sequences that fold into wonderfold structures gives rise to superfamilies,
i.e. sets of dissimilar sequences that fold into the same or very similar
structures. Wonderfolds appear to be the most designable structures out of
complete set of compact lattice proteins. Furthermore, proteins having
wondefolds as their native structure tend to be most thermostable among all
evolved proteins. This effect is purely due to the favorable geometric
properties of wonderfolds and, thus, dominates any dependence on sequences. The
present work establishes a model of prebiotic structure selection, which
identifies dominant structural patterns emerging upon optimization of proteins
for survival in hot environment. Convergently discovered prebiotic initial
superfamilies with wonderfold structures could have served as a seed for

where transitions between the mechanically distinct states of the biomolecule
occur on either much faster or much slower time scales than those governing the
