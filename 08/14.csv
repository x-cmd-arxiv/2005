remnant in the emission lines of [O III] 5007, Halpha and [N II] 6548. The [O
III] Fabry-Perot scans reveal a bright crescent-shaped spur of previously known
high-velocity (V_radial ~ 1500 km/s) O-rich ejecta located on the eastern side
of the remnant. The spur consists of a semi-coherent structure of mostly
redshifted material, along with several clumps that have apparently broken out
of the more orderly shell-like expansion. The high velocity (>= 600 km/s)
component of the spur also displays a scalloped morphology characteristic of
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We also find a large number of fast-moving knots
(FMKs) of O-rich ejecta undetected in prior photographic plate images and
similar to features seen in Cas A. The position-velocity distribution of the
FMKs can be kinematically described as a shell 3.4' in radius expanding at a
velocity of 1700 km/s. Another feature apparent in the [O III] scans is an
equatorial belt consisting of both a bar-like structure at zero radial velocity
and a clumpy, high velocity ejecta component seen in projection along the line
of sight. The bar is also detected in our Halpha RFP images at zero radial
velocity, providing further evidence that this structure is of circumstellar
origin. We find that the optical and X-ray properties of the bar are consistent
with incomplete (partially radiative) shocks in material of moderate densities.
Assuming a distance of 6 kpc for G292.0+1.8, we estimate a kinematic age of
(3000-3400) d_6 years for this remnant (Abridged).

the gap. This significantly reduces the sensitivity to correlated soft
large-angle radiation (non-global leading logs), numerically calculable only in

a natural extension to the standard model. This is achieved by endowing leptons
with new degrees of freedom -- leptonic colour, an analogue of the familiar
quark colour. Grand and partially unified models which utilise this new gauge
symmetry SU(3)_\ell have been proposed in the context of the quartification
gauge group SU(3)^4. Phenomenologically successful gauge coupling constant
unification without supersymmetry has been demonstrated for cases where the
symmetry breaking leaves a residual SU(2)_\ell unbroken. Though attractive,
these schemes either incorporate ad hoc discrete symmetries and
non-renormalisable mass terms, or achieve only partial unification. We show
that grand unified models can be constructed where the quartification group can
be broken fully [i.e. no residual SU(2)_\ell] to the standard model gauge group
without requiring additional discrete symmetries or higher dimension operators.
These models also automatically have suppressed nonzero neutrino masses. We
perform a systematic analysis of the renormalisation-group equations for all
possible symmetry breaking routes from SU(3)^4 --> SU(3)_q x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y.
This analysis indicates that gauge coupling unification can be achieved for
several different symmetry breaking patterns and we outline the requirements
that each gives on the unification scale. We also show that the unification
scenarios of those models which leave a residual SU(2)_\ell symmetry are not
unique. In both symmetry breaking cases, some of the scenarios require new
physics at the TeV scale, while others do not allow for new TeV phenomenology

groups. These groups generalize gauge groups to the case of nontrivial action
on the base space of bundles with use of idea of groups deformations.
  We also show that infinite deformed groups give a group-theoretic description
of gauge fields (gravitational field with its metric or vierbein part similarly
to gauge fields of internal symmetry) which is alternative for their
geometrical interpretation.

finite temperature. This moment of inertia describes the spin distribution of
nuclear levels in the framework of the spin-cutoff model. Our model is based on
a deformed single-particle Hamiltonian with pairing interaction and takes into
account fluctuations in the pairing gap. We derive a formula for the moment of
inertia at finite temperature that generalizes the Belyaev formula for zero
temperature. We show that a number-parity projection explains the strong
odd-even effects observed in shell model Monte Carlo studies of the nuclear
moment of inertia in the iron region.

motivated by recent experiments involving simultaneous optical trapping of two
different alkali species. Our data can be used to predict the oscillation
frequencies of optically-trapped atoms, and particularly the ratios of
frequencies of different species held in the same trap. We identify wavelengths
at which two different alkali atoms have the same oscillation frequency.

of the velocity fluctuations have failed to yield clear-cut empirical evidence
of the existence of fully developed turbulence. Here we relate the friction

unequivocal evidence of the existence of fully developed turbulence.

recirculating linear accelerators with coupled beam optics and with polarized
higher order dipole modes. The bunches do not have to be at the same RF phase
during each recirculation turn. This is important for the description of energy
recovery linacs (ERLs) where beam currents become very large and coupled optics
are used on purpose to increase the threshold current. A remarkable agreement
with tracking data is demonstrated. The general formulas are then analyzed for
several analytically solvable cases, which show: (a) Why different higher order
modes (HOM) in one cavity can couple and cannot be considered individually,
even when their frequencies are separated by much more than the resonance
widths of the HOMs. For the Cornell ERL as an example, it is noted that optimum
advantage of coupled optics is taken when the cavities are designed with an
$x$-$y$ HOM frequency splitting of above 50MHz. The threshold current is then
far above the design current of this accelerator. (b) How the $x$-$y$ coupling
in the particle optics determines when modes can be considered separately. (c)
That the increase of the threshold current obtainable by coupled optics and
polarized modes diminishes roughly with the square root of the HOMs' quality
factors. Therefore the largest advantages are achieved with cavities that are
not specifically designed to minimize these quality factors, e.g. by means of
HOM absorbers. (d) How multiple-turn recirculation interferes with the
threshold improvements obtained with a coupled optics.

pulse. By appropriately choosing the dump pulse parameters and time delay with
respect to the photoassociation pulse, we show that a large number of deeply

broad-bandwidth dump pulses which maximize the probability to form molecules

  example","4 pages, 2 figures, to be submitted to Physical Review Letters",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.73.010904",,"q-bio.PE q-bio.CB",,"  This paper develops a quasispecies model where cells can adopt a two-cell
survival strategy. Within this strategy, pairs of cells join together, at which
point one of the cells sacrifices its own replicative ability for the sake of
the other cell. We develop a simplified model for the evolutionary dynamics of
this process, allowing us to solve for the steady-state using standard
approaches from quasispecies theory. We find that our model exhibits two
distinct regimes of behavior: At low concentrations of limiting resource, the
two-cell strategy outcompetes the single-cell survival strategy, while at high
concentrations of limiting resource, the single-cell survival strategy
dominates. Associated with the two solution regimes of our model is a
localization to delocalization transition over the portion of the genome coding
for the multicell strategy, analogous to the error catastrophe in standard
quasispecies models. The existence of such a transition indicates that
multicellularity can emerge because natural selection does not act on specific
cells, but rather on replicative strategies. Within this framework, individual
cells become the means by which replicative strategies are propagated. Such a
framework is therefore consistent with the concept that natural selection does
not act on individuals, but rather on populations.

"q-bio/0508015","Reidun Twarock Dr","Reidun Twarock","A toolkit for the construction of icosahedral particles with local
  symmetry axes","11 pages",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  A formalism is developed which allows to determine the locations of all local
symmetry axes of three-dimensional particles with overall icosahedral symmetry.
It relies on the fact that the root system of the non-crystallographic Coxeter
group H_3 encodes the locations of the planes of reflection that generate the
discrete rotational symmetries of the particles. Via an appropriate extension
of the root system, new planes of reflection are introduced which determine
local axes of rotational symmetry. An easy-to-implement formalism is derived
that allows to compute the surface structure of any three-dimensional
icosahedral particle with local symmetries. It can be used also for particles
with overall octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry in conjunction with the root
systems of the corresponding reflection groups.
  Applications to viruses are discussed explicitly. It is shown that the
concept of quasi-equivalence in Caspar-Klug Theory corresponds to the special
case of local six-fold symmetry axes contained in the theory developed here,
and the corresponding geometries can hence be obtained with this formalism
based on the root system of H_3.
  Moreover, as a by-product, the theory answers the long-standing open question
why only certain types of capsomeres, i.e. clusters of protein subunits, are
observed in the surface structures of viruses. Since the types of the
capsomeres are determined by the orders of the local symmetry axes on which
they are located, the possible types of capsomeres are restricted by the
spectrum of local symmetry axes allowed by the theory. Based on this we
determine the spectrum of all capsomere types that may occur in viral capsids
and give explicit examples for the lower-order cases.
