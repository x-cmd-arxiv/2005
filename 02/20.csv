  global axisymmetric perturbations","20 pages, 4 figues (last figure in jpg format). Submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The purpose of this paper is to explore how accretion discs manifest the
phenomenon of transient growth on a global scale. We investigate analytically
the time response of a thin accretion disc to particular axisymmetric
perturbations. To facilitate an analytical treatment we replace the energy
equation with a general polytropic assumption. The asymptotic expansion of
Klu\'zniak & Kita (2000), which extended the method of Regev (1983) to a full
steady polytropic disc (with $n=3/2$), is further developed and implemented for
both the steady (for any polytropic index) and time-dependent problems. The
spatial form and temporal behaviour of selected dynamical disturbances are
studied in detail. We identify the perturbation space which leads to transient
growth and provide analytical solutions which manifest this expected transient
growth behaviour. Three terms (physical causes) responsible for the appearance
of transient growth are identified. Two depend explicitly on the viscosity
while the third one is relevant also for inviscid discs. The main conclusion we
draw is that the phenomenon of transient growth exists in discs on a global
scale.

pairs on a string of intermediate non-resonant grains) at T > T_c. The
corresponding E-S temperature T_ES in the latter case is slightly
(logarithmically) T-dependent. The magnetoresistance in the two cases is
different: it may be relatively strong and negative at T much below T_c, while
at T>T_c it is suppressed due to inelastic processes which destroy the

($(40,158)A$ GeV) energies are investigated in a nonequilibrium transport model
with nuclear mean-field (MF). Sideward $<p_x>$, directed $v_1$, and elliptic
flows $v_2$ are systematically studied with different assumptions on the
nuclear equation of state (EOS). We find that momentum dependence in the
nuclear MF is important for the understanding of the proton collective flows at
AGS and SPS energies. Calculated results with momentum dependent MF
qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of proton sideward, directed, and
elliptic flows in a incident energy range of $(2-158)A$ GeV.

emission spectrum whose features depend on the type of tissue, viz., healthy,
adenoma or malignant. Hence measurement of the fluorescence is potentially a
rapid and reliable diagnostic method. We have applied the technique to thyroid
tissues and found that judicious normalization of the fluorescence spectrum
reveals a close correlation between spectral shape and tissue type. Hence the
pathological state of the tissue can be unambiguously identified from the
laser-induced fluorescence spectrum. The method is rapid and portable and is
therefore eminently suitable for use during operations.

the simplifying assumption that amino acid substitutions at neighboring sites
are uncorrelated. This assumption allows implementation of fast algorithms for
pairwise sequence alignment, but it ignores information that could conceivably
increase the power of remote homolog detection. We examine the validity of this
assumption by constructing extended substitution matrixes that encapsulate the
observed correlations between neighboring sites, by developing an efficient and
rigorous algorithm for pairwise protein sequence alignment that incorporates
these local substitution correlations, and by assessing the ability of this
algorithm to detect remote homologies. Results: Our analysis indicates that
local correlations between substitutions are not strong on the average.
Furthermore, incorporating local substitution correlations into pairwise
alignment did not lead to a statistically significant improvement in remote
homology detection. Therefore, the standard assumption that individual residues
within protein sequences evolve independently of neighboring positions appears
to be an efficient and appropriate approximation.

Lett. 95, 030503 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.030503",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate multipartite entanglement in a non-interacting fermion gas, as
a function of fermion separation, starting from the many particle fermion
density matrix. We prove that all multiparticle entanglement can be built only
out of two-fermion entanglement. Although from the Pauli exclusion principle we
would always expect entanglement to decrease with fermion distance, we
surprisingly find the opposite effect for certain fermion configurations. The
von Neumann entropy is found to be proportional to the volume for a large
number of particles even when they are arbitrarily close to each other. We will
illustrate our results using different configurations of two, three, and four
fermions at zero temperature although all our results can be applied to any
temperature and any number of particles.
