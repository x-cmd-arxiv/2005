one of the most distant X-ray selected clusters of galaxies, which also shows
an unusual double-lobed X-ray morphology, indicative of a possible equal-mass
cluster merger. Using Keck-DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the
2x1.5 arcmin region surrounding RX J1053.7+5735, we secured redshifts for six
galaxies in the range 1.129 < z < 1.139, with a mean redshift <z>=1.134. The
mean redshift agrees well with the cluster X-ray redshift previously estimated
from the cluster X-ray Fe-K line, confirming the presence of a cluster at
z~1.135. Galaxies with concordant redshifts are located in both eastern and
western sub-clusters of the double cluster structure, indicating that both
sub-clusters are at similar redshifts. This result is also consistent with a
previous claim that both eastern and western X-ray lobes have similar X-ray
redshifts. Based on their separation of ~ 250 kpc/h, these results support the
interpretation that RX J1053.7+5735 is an equal-mass cluster merger taken place
at z ~ 1, although further direct evidence for dynamical state of the cluster
is needed for a more definitive statement about the cluster merging state. The
six galaxies have a line-of-sight velocity dispersion = 650 km/s. All six
galaxies show clear absorption features of CaII H & K, and several Balmer
lines, typical of early galaxies at the present epoch, in agreement with their
I-K colors. A color-magnitude diagram, constructed from deep optical/NIR
observations of the RX J1053.7+5735 field, shows a clear red color sequence.
There is an indication that the red sequence in RX J1053.7+5735 lies ~ 0.3 to
the blue of the Coma line, qualitatively consistent with previous studies
investigating other clusters at z ~ 1.

the anomalous merging galaxy NGC520, a similarly-evolved system to the
well-known Antennae galaxies, are presented here. Of great interest is the fact
that NGC520, on account of it being due to the result of an encounter between
one gas-rich disk and one gas-poor disk, appears in X-rays to be only 'half a
merger'; Whereas a ULX lies at the primary (SE), more-massive nucleus, no
sources are seen at the secondary nucleus. Whereas what appears to be a
starburst-driven galactic wind is seen outflowing perpendicular to the
molecular disk surrounding the primary nucleus, no such diffuse structure is
seen anywhere near the secondary nucleus. Comparing the X-ray properties with
those of other merging galaxies, one sees that, relative to its SFR, the number
of ULXs seen within the system is rather small. Similarly the total X-ray
luminosity and the fraction of this emission that appears diffuse are both a
factor ~2 less than that expected based on NGC520's evolutionary merger stage.
15 X-ray sources are detected within the system, including a small number of
bright ULXs that flatten the source XLF to a level similar to that of the
Antennae and other mergers. Lastly, to see what appears to be a
starburst-driven diffuse galactic wind, with a spectrum entirely consistent
with that of other known galactic winds, though unusually, emanating from only
one of the nuclei, is a surprise, given that one might have expected such
structures to have distorted very quickly in such a rapidly evolving
environment. The wind is larger and more massive than features seen in
evolutionarily earlier systems (eg the Mice), but smaller and less massive than
as seen in later systems (eg the Antennae), or classic starbursts.

formation are explored and contrasted with the gradual accumulation of mass by
accretion. Protostellar mergers may produce high luminosity infrared flares
lasting years to centuries followed by a luminosity decline on the
Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale of the merger product. Mergers may be surrounded by
thick tori of expanding debris, impulsive wide-angle outflows, and shock
induced maser and radio continuum emission. Collision products are expected to
have fast stellar rotation and a large multiplicity fraction. Close encounters
or mergers will produce circumstellar debris disks with an orientation that
differs form that of a pre-existing disk. The extremely rare merger of two
stars close to the upper-mass end of the IMF may be a possible pathway to
hypernova generated gamma-ray bursters. While accretional growth can lead to
the formation of massive stars in isolation or in loose clusters, mergers can
only occur in high-density cluster environments. It is proposed that the
outflow emerging from the OMC1 core in the Orion molecular cloud was produced
by a protostellar merger that released between $10^{48}$ to $10^{49}$ ergs less

these notions are important tools for the identification of local directional

enrichment of the early universe is discussed. We first compare our predictions
with the abundance ratios measured in the high redshift Lyman-alpha forest to
check whether they are compatible with the values predicted by assuming that
the early universe was enriched by massive pop III stars. We conclude that to
explain the observed C/Si ratio in the intergalactic medium, a contribution
from pop II stars to carbon enrichment is necessary, already at redshift z=5.
We then evaluate the number of Pair-Instability Supernovae (SN_(gamma gamma))
required to enrich the universe to the critical metallicity Z_cr, i.e. the
metallicity value which causes the transition from a very massive star regime
(m > 100 M_sun) to a lower mass regime, similar to the one characteristic of
the present time (m < 100 M_sun). It is found that between 110 and 115
SN_(gamma gamma) are sufficient to chemically enrich a cubic megaparsec of the
intergalactic medium at high redshift for a variety of initial mass functions.
The number of ionizing photons provided by these SN_(gamma gamma) and also by
the pop III stars ending as black holes was computed and we conclude that there
are not enough photons to reionize the universe, being down by at least a
factor of ~ 3. Finally, we calculate the abundance ratios generated by pop III
stars and compare it with the ones observed in low metallicity Damped
Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). We suggest that pop III stars alone cannot be
responsible for the abundance ratios in these objects and that intermediate
mass pop II stars must have played an important role especially in enriching
DLAs in nitrogen.

fractions and colour distributions of galaxies in clusters and in cluster
outskirts, at z=0. No systematic dependency on cluster richness is found either
for the galaxy luminosity functions, morphological mixes, or colour
distributions. Moving from higher density (cluster cores), to lower density
environments (cluster outskirts), we detect a progressive flattening of the
luminosity functions, an increase of the fraction of spirals and a decrease of
that of ellipticals and S0s, and the progressive emergence of a bluer tail in
the distributions of galaxy colours, especially for spirals. As compared to
cluster spirals, early-type galaxies show a flatter luminosity function, and
more homogeneous and redder colours. An overall good agreement is found between
our results and the observations, particularly in terms of the cluster
luminosity functions and morphological mixes. However, some discrepancies are
also apparent, with too faint magnitudes of the brightest cluster members,
especially in the B band, and galaxy colours tendentially too red (or not blue
enough) in the model, with respect to the observations. Finally, ram pressure

subhalo sample from an isotropic distribution is P_KS \simeq 1.5 \times

hypothesis for testing the CDM paradigm. The nearly planar distribution of
observed Milky Way (MW) satellites is marginally consistent (probability \simeq

simulations. Furthermore, if we select the subhalos likely to be luminous, we
find a distribution that is consistent with the observed MW satellites. In
fact, we show that subsamples of the subhalo population with a
centrally-concentrated radial distribution, similar to that of the MW dwarfs,
typically exhibit a comparable degree of planarity. We explore the origin of
the observed subhalo anisotropy and conclude that it is likely due to (1)
preferential accretion of subhalos along filaments, often closely aligned with
the major axis of the host halo, and (2) evolution of satellite orbits within
the prolate, triaxial potentials typical of CDM halos. Agreement between
predictions and observations requires the major axis of the outer dark matter
halo of the Milky Way to be nearly perpendicular to the disk. We discuss
possible observational tests of such disk-halo alignment with current large

wavenumbers, $m$, propagating in the surface fluid ocean of rotating neutron

photons from the stellar surface to a distant observer using the Schwarzschild
metric. The wave motions of the surface $r$-modes are confined to the
equatorial region of the star, and the surface pattern of the temperature
variation can be either symmetric (for even modes) or anti-symmetric (for odd
modes) with respect to the equator. Since for the surface $r$-modes the
oscillation frequency in the corotating frame of the star is much smaller than
the rotation frequency, $\Omega$, we employ the approximation in which the
oscillation frequency in the inertial frame, $\sigma$, is given by $\sigma=
-m\Omega$. We find that the $even$, $m = 1$ $r$-mode produces the largest light
variations. The dominant Fourier component in the light curves of these modes
is the fundamental having $\sigma=-\Omega$, and the first harmonic component
having $\sigma=-2\Omega$ is always negligible in comparison. The dominant
Fourier component of the even, $m=2$ $r$-modes is the first harmonic. Although
the $odd$ $r$-modes produce smaller amplitude light variations compared with
the $even$ modes, the light curves of the former have a stronger first harmonic
component. If both $m=1$ and 2 $r$-modes are excited simultaneously, a rich
variety of light curves is possible, including those having an appreciable
first harmonic component. We show that the phase difference, $\delta-\delta_E$,
between the bolometric light curve and that at a particular photon energy can
possibly be used as a probe of the stellar compactness, $R/M$, where $R$ and

forming a rotationally support torus. However, in the MHD case even with a very
weak initial magnetic field, the flow settles into a configuration with four

carried out by a large scale magnetic field. We review previous simulations,
where specific angular momentum was higher than that assumed here, and conclude
that our bipolar outflow develops for a wide range of the properties of the

photometry from CIRSI, with optical data from the ESO WFI. For a Sculptor-like
old and generally metal-poor system, the position of RGB stars on the
colour-magnitude diagram is mainly metallicity dependent. The advantage of
using optical-NIR colours is that the position of the RGB locus is much more
sensitive to metallicity than with optical colours alone. In contrast the
horizontal branch (HB) morphology is strongly dependent on both metallicity and
age. Therefore a detailed study of both the RGB in optical-NIR colours and the
HB can help break the age-metallicity degeneracy. Our measured photometric
width of the Sculptor giant branch corresponds to a range in metallicity of
0.75 dex. We detect the RGB and AGB bumps in both the NIR and optical
luminosity functions, and derive from them a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -1.3
+/- 0.1. From isochrone fitting we derive a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.42
with a dispersion of 0.2 dex. These photometric estimators are for the first
time consistent with individual metallicity measurements derived from
spectroscopic observations. No spatial gradient is detected in the RGB
morphology within a radius of 13 arcmin, twice the core radius. On the other
hand, a significant gradient is observed in the HB morphology index, confirming
the `second parameter problem' present in this galaxy. These observations are
consistent with an early extended period of star formation continuing in time

expansion of the Universe is ''phantom energy''. The latter possesses an
equation of state of the form $\omega\equiv p/\rho<-1$, consequently violating
the null energy condition. As this is the fundamental ingredient to sustain
traversable wormholes, this cosmic fluid presents us with a natural scenario
for the existence of these exotic geometries. Due to the fact of the
accelerating Universe, macroscopic wormholes could naturally be grown from the
submicroscopic constructions that originally pervaded the quantum foam. One
could also imagine an advanced civilization mining the cosmic fluid for phantom
energy necessary to construct and sustain a traversable wormhole.
  In this context, we investigate the physical properties and characteristics
of traversable wormholes constructed using the equation of state $p=\omega
\rho$, with $\omega<-1$. We analyze specific wormhole geometries, considering
asymptotically flat spacetimes and imposing an isotropic pressure. We also
construct a thin shell around the interior wormhole solution, by imposing the
phantom energy equation of state on the surface stresses. Using the ''volume
integral quantifier'' we verify that it is theoretically possible to construct
these geometries with vanishing amounts of averaged null energy condition
violating phantom energy. Specific wormhole dimensions and the traversal
velocity and time are also deduced from the traversability conditions for a
particular wormhole geometry. These phantom energy traversable wormholes have
far-reaching physical and cosmological implications. For instance, an advanced
civilization may use these geometries to induce closed timelike curves,
consequently violating causality.

exploiting a duality principle relating the evolutions in the target and the

to birefringence and anisotropic effects in the photon dispersion relations.
Expressions for them are obtained, which depend on the neutrino number
densities and involve momentum integrals over the electron distribution
functions, and are valid for any value of the photon momentum and general
conditions of the electron gas. Those expressions are evaluated explicitly for
several special cases and approximations which are generally useful in

two additional ones related to the photon self-energy functions. As an

family of differential equalities. In the rest of the paper, We show several
applications of this new estimate and its linear version proved earlier in

the earlier result of Li and Tian, a manifold version of Stoll's theorem on the
characterization of `algebraic divisors', and a localized monotonicity formula

volume monotonicity of Perelman, we prove a sharp lower bound heat kernel
estimate for the time-dependent heat equation, which is, in a certain sense,
dual to Perelman's monotonicity of the `reduced volume'. As an application of
this new monotonicity formula, we show that the blow-down limit of a certain
type III immortal solution is a gradient expanding soliton.

found that most of the approximations provide an accurate description of the

only near the center of the nucleus. It is therefore necessary that the

given that the effective momentum approximation with a fitted potential

density of single-particle levels corresponding to an effective $k$-mass

rise to an induced pairing interaction $v_{ind}$ peaked at $e_F$. The
interaction $(v_{low-k}+ v_{ind})Z_{\omega}$ arising from the renormalization
of the bare nucleon-nucleon potential and of the single-particle motion

chiral topological models of QCD. The whole content of the thesis may be
divided into two main parts. In the first part the original Skyrme model with
finite pion mass has been extended by inclusion of the light scalar - isoscalar
sigma - meson. The Lagrangian has been further extended by explicit inclusion
of sigma, rho and omega - mesons as well. In order to get a more complete
picture of NN potential the appropriate meson - nucleon vertex form - factors
are obtained. The second part of the thesis considers a nucleon immersed into a
nuclear medium. For this purpose a medium modified Skyrme Lagrangian has been
proposed. The Lagrangian describes well such well known medium effects as
decreasing of nucleon mass and increasing of its size (swelling). We studied
also a system with finite temperature also. The temperature effects are taken
into account by using the method of termofield dynamics (TFD). The
corresponding critical temperatures for each meson - nucleon system are

collisional and dielectric frictions which, respectively, increase and decrease

target DNA sequences is several orders of magnitude faster than the maximal one
calculated from the diffusion--limited theory. It was therefore commonly
assumed that the target site interaction of a restriction enzyme with DNA has
to occur via two steps: one--dimensional diffusion along a DNA segment, and
long--range jumps coming from association/dissociation events. We propose here
a stochastic model for this reaction which comprises a series of 1D diffusions
of a restriction enzyme on non-specific DNA sequences interrupted by 3D
excursions in the solution until the target sequence is reached. This model
provides an optimal finding strategy which explains the fast association rate.
Modeling the excursions by uncorrelated random jumps, we recover the expression
of the mean time required for target site association to occur given by Berg &
al. \cite{berg81}, and we explicitly give several physical quantities
describing the stochastic pathway of the enzyme. For competitive target sites
we calculate two quantities: processivity and preference. By comparing these
theoretical expressions to recent experimental data obtained for
\textit{Eco}RV--DNA interaction, we quantify: i) the mean residence time per
binding event of \textit{Eco}RV on DNA for a representative 1D diffusion
coefficient, ii) the average lengths of DNA scanned during the 1D diffusion
(during one binding event and during the overall process), iii) the mean time
and the mean number of visits needed to go from one target site to the other.
Further, we evaluate the dynamics of DNA cleavage with regard to the
probability for the restriction enzyme to perform another 1D diffusion on the
same DNA substrate following a 3D excursion.

Specifically, we demonstrate that one can (i) find functional modules in
complex networks, and (ii) classify nodes into universal roles according to
their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a
``cartographic representation'' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are
among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with
more potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyze the
metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different super-kingdoms. We
find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within
their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by
different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that
low-degree metabolites that connect different modules are more conserved than
hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.

population transfer problem from the first to the second level, minimizing the

a suitable Hopf projection), this problem can be attacked with techniques of
optimal syntheses on 2-D manifolds.
  Let $(-E,E)$ be the two energy levels, and $|\Omega(t)|\leq M$ the bound on
the field amplitude. For each values of $E$ and $M$, we provide the explicit
expression of the time optimal trajectory steering the state one to the state
two in terms of a parameter that should be computed numerically.
  For $M<<E$, every time optimal trajectory is periodic (and in particular
bang-bang) with frequency of the order of the resonance frequency
$\omega_R=2E$.
  On the other side, for $M>E$ the time optimal trajectory steering the state
one to the state two is bang-bang with exactly one switching. Fixed $E$ we also
prove that for $M\to\infty$ the time needed to reach the state two tends to
zero.

Hamiltonian. This paper begins a systematic study of channels defined by
representations; the famous Werner-Holevo channel is one element of this
infinite class. We show that the channel derived from the defining
representation of SU(n) is a depolarizing channel for all $n$, but for most
other representations this is not the case. Since the Bloch sphere is not
appropriate here, we develop technology which is a generalization of Bloch's
technique. Our method works by representing the density matrix as a polynomial
in symmetrized products of Lie algebra generators, with coefficients that are
symmetric tensors. Using these tensor methods we prove eleven theorems, derive
many explicit formulas and show other interesting properties of quantum
channels in various dimensions, with various Lie symmetry algebras. We also

vibrational degrees of freedom. This leads one to ask whether these internal
motions can play a role in degrading the interference pattern. We study this by
means of a simple model. Our molecule consists of two masses a fixed distance
apart. It scatters from a potential with two or several peaks, thereby
mimicking two or several slit interference. We find that in some parameter
regimes the entanglement between the internal states and the translational
degrees of freedom produced by the potential can decrease the visibility of the
interference pattern. In particular, different internal states correspond to
different outgoing wave vectors, so that if several internal states are
excited, the total interference pattern will be the sum of a number of
patterns, each with a different periodicity. The overall pattern is
consequently smeared out. In the case of two different peaks, the scattering
from the different peaks will excite different internal states so that the path
the molecule takes become entangled with its internal state. This will also
lead to degradation of the interference pattern. How these mechanisms might
lead to the emergence of classical behavior is discussed.
