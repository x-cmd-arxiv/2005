resulting from carbon burning in ``heavy weight'' intermediate--mass stars ($8
M_{\sun}\la M \la 11 M_{\sun}$) and growing in mass, either from carbon burning
in a shell or from accretion of matter in a close binary system, are examined
in the light of their detailed chemical composition. In particular, we have
modelled the evolution taking into account the abundances of the following
minor nuclear species, which result from the previous evolutionary history:
$^{12}$C, $^{23}$Na, $^{24}$Mg, and $^{25}$Mg. Both $^{23}$Na and $^{25}$Mg
give rise to Urca processes, which are found to be unimportant for the final
outcome of the evolution. $^{24}$Mg was formerly considered a major component
of ONe cores (hence called ONeMg cores), but updated evolutionary calculations
in this mass range have severely reduced its abundance. Nevertheless, we have
parameterized it and we have found that the minimum amount of $^{24}$Mg
required to produce NeO burning at moderate densities is $\sim 23%$, a value
exceedingly high in the light of recent evolutionary models. Finally, we have
determined that models with relatively small abundances of unburnt carbon
($X(^{12}$C)$\sim 0.015$) could be a channel to explosion at low to moderate
density ($\sim 1\times 10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$). This is clearly below the current
estimate for the explosion/collapse threshold and would have interesting

begin by defining starbursts in several different ways, and discuss the merits
and limitations of these definitions. I will argue that the most physically
useful definition of a starburst is its ``intensity'' (star formation rate per
unit area). This is the most natural parameter to compare local starbursts with
physically similar galaxies at high redshift, and indeed I will argue that
local starbursts are unique laboratories to study the processes at work in the
early universe. I will describe how NASA's GALEX mission has uncovered a rare
population of close analogs to Lyman Break Galaxies in the local universe. I
will then compare local starbursts to the Lyman-Break and sub-mm galaxies high
redshift populations, and speculate that the multidimensional ``manifold'' of
starbursts near and far can be understood largely in terms of the
Schmidt/Kennicutt law and galaxy mass-metallicity relation. I will briefly
summarize he properties of starburst-driven galactic superwinds and their
possible implications for the evolution of galaxies and the IGM. These complex
multiphase flows are best studied in nearby starbursts, where we can study the
the hot X-ray gas that contains the bulk of the energy and newly produced

accretion rates for objects at such extremely low masses. For the six objects

the smallest yet measured. These new results continue the trend of decreasing

temperature and column density profiles of the core. We find that the dust
temperature at the center of TMC-1C is 7 K, rising to 11 K at the edges. We
discuss the possibility and effects of a variable emissivity spectral index on
the derived mass profile. The low dust temperature of TMC-1C results in a high
derived mass for the core, significantly larger than the virial mass estimated
from the linewidth of the N2H+ (1-0) transition. This result is valid within a
wide range of dust properties and ellipticities of the core. The N2H+ (1-0)

which provide evidence of sub-sonic infall motions. The derived density profile

models admit the following interesting possibilities: (i) The effective
equation of state can be w < -1 as well as w > -1. In the former case the
expansion of the universe is well behaved at all times and the universe does
not run into a future `Big Rip' singularity which is usually encountered by
Phantom models. (ii) For a class of Braneworld models the acceleration of the
universe can be a transient phenomenon. In this case the current acceleration
of the universe is sandwiched between two matter dominated epochs. Such a
braneworld does not have a horizon in contrast to LCDM and most Quintessence
models. (iii) For a specific set of parameter values the universe can either
originate from, or end its existence in a Quiescent singularity, at which the
density, pressure and Hubble parameter remain finite, while the deceleration
parameter and all invariants of the Riemann tensor diverge to infinity within a
finite interval of cosmic time. (iv) Braneworld models of dark energy can
loiter at high redshifts: $6 \lleq z \lleq 40$. The Hubble parameter
decreasesduring the loitering epoch relative to its value in LCDM. As a result
the age of the universe at loitering dramatically increases and this is
expected to boost the formation of high redshift gravitationally bound systems
such as $10^9 M_\odot$ black holes at $z \sim 6$ and lower-mass black holes
and/or Population III stars at $z > 10$, whose existence could be problematic
within the LCDM scenario. (v) Braneworld models with a time-like extra
dimension bounce at early times thereby avoiding the initial `Big Bang
singularity'. (vi) Both Inflation and Dark Energy can be successfully unified
within a single scheme (Quintessential Inflation).

interact each other exchanging energy. We show that the cubic correction to the
Hubble law, measured by distant supernovae type Ia, probes this interaction. We
demonstrate that influences between nonrelativistic matter and vacuum sectors
are controlled by third and higher derivatives of the scale factor. As an
example we consider flat decaying $\Lambda(t)$ FRW cosmologies. We point out
the possibility of measure of the energy transfer by the cubic and higher
corrections to Hubble's law. The statistical analysis of SNIa data is used as
an evidence of energy transfer. We find that there were the transfer from the
dark energy sector to the dark matter one without any assumption about physics
governing this process. We confront this hypothesis about the transfer with
SNIa observations and find that the transfer the phantom and matter sector is
admissible for $\Omega_{\text{m},0}=0.27$. We also demonstrate that it is

temperature, by using Chandra data. L_X,nuc varies by \sim 3 orders of
magnitude and does not show a relationship with M_BH or with the Bondi mass
accretion rate \dotM_B. L_X,nuc is always much lower than expected if \dotM_B
ends in a standard accretion disc with high radiative efficiency (this instead
can be the case of the active nucleus of Cen A). Radiatively inefficient
accretion as in the standard ADAF modeling may explain the low luminosities of
a few cases; for others, the predicted luminosity is still too high and, in
terms of Eddington-scaled quantities, it is increasingly higher than observed,
for increasing \dotM_B. Variants of the simple radiatively inefficient scenario
including outflow and convection may reproduce the low emission levels
observed, since the amount of matter actually accreted is reduced considerably.
However, the most promising scenario includes feedback from accretion on the
surrounding gas: this has the important advantages of naturally explaining the
observed lack of relationship between L_X,nuc, M_BH and \dotM_B, and of evading
the problem of the fate of the material accumulating in the central galactic
regions over cosmological times.

Detection of a large one-sided HI loop to the north of NGC 2820. No radio
continuum emission or Halpha emission is detected. We discuss various scenarios
for the origin of this loop. The central starburst scenario is not supported
due to lack of ionized gas in the loop. For an electron density of 4x10^(-4)
cm^-3 we estimate the ram pressure force of the IGrM to be comparable to the
gravitational pull of the disk of NGC2820. We suggest that the loop could have
formed by ram pressure stripping if tidal effects had reduced the surface
density of HI in NGC2820. Finally we suggest that the evolution of the Ho124
group may be governed by both tidal forces due to the interaction and ram
pressure due to motion of the member galaxies in the IGrM and that the IGrM
densities might not be too low (>~4x10^(-4)cm^-3). This should be verified by
other observations.

an extended (20 kpc) tidal tail at the north-west edge of the galaxy previously
undetected at other wavelengths, at 15-25 kpc from its nucleus. Except in the
nucleus, the UV morphology of NGC 4438 is totally different from the
Halpha+[NII] one, more similar to the X-ray emission, confirming its gas
cooling origin. We study the star formation history of NGC 4438 combining
spectro-photometric data in the UV-visible-near-IR wavelength range with
population synthesis and galaxy evolution models. The data are consistent with
a recent (~ 10 Myr), instantaneous burst of star formation in the newly
discovered UV north-western tail which is significantly younger than the age of
the tidal interaction with NGC 4435, dated by dynamical models at ~ 100 Myr
ago. Recent star formation events are also present at the edge of the northern
arm and in the southern tail, while totally lacking in the other regions, which
are dominated by the old stellar population perturbed during the dynamical
interaction with NGC 4435. The contribution of this recent starburst to the
total galaxy stellar mass is lower than 0.1%, an extremely low value for such a
violent interaction. High-velocity, off-center tidal encounters such as that
observed in Arp 120 are thus not sufficient to significantly increase the star
formation activity of cluster galaxies.

innevitably develop a quantum-mechanical coupling via the mechanism of ``order
from disorder''. We show how the order from disorder coupling mechanism can be
viewed as a result of magnon pair tunneling, a process closely analogous to
pair tunneling in the Josephson effect. In the spin system, the Josephson
coupling manifests itself as a a biquadratic spin coupling between layers, and
for quantum spins, these coupling terms are as large as the inplane coupling.
An alternative mechanism for decoupling spin layers occurs in classical XY
models in which decoupled ""sliding phases"" of spin fluid can form in certain
finely tuned conditions. Unfortunately, these finely tuned situations appear
equally susceptible to the strong-coupling effects of quantum tunneling,
forcing us to conclude that in general, geometric frustration cannot preserve a

the probability of formation of a ferromagnetic string of length $n$ in the
antiferromagnetic ground state of the chain and plays an important role in the
theory of integrable models. For the XY Spin Chain, the correlator can be
expressed as the determinant of a Toeplitz matrix and its asymptotical
behaviors for $n \to \infty$ throughout the phase diagram are obtained using
known theorems and conjectures on Toeplitz determinants. We find that the decay
is exponential everywhere in the phase diagram of the XY model except on the
critical lines, i.e. where the spectrum is gapless. In these cases, a power-law
prefactor with a universal exponent arises in addition to an exponential or
Gaussian decay. The latter Gaussian behavior holds on the critical line
corresponding to the isotropic XY model, while at the critical value of the
magnetic field the EFP decays exponentially. At small anisotropy one has a
crossover from the Gaussian to the exponential behavior. We study this
crossover using the bosonization approach.

dynamic simulation. Each pair of particles is thermostated either (with
probability P) with a pairwise Lowe-Andersen thermostat, or (with probability
1-P) with a thermostat that is introduced here, which is based on a pairwise
interaction similar to the Nose-Hoover thermostat. When the pairwise
Nose-Hoover thermostat dominates (low P), the liquid has a high diffusion
coefficient and low viscosity, but when the Lowe-Andersen thermostat dominates,
the diffusion coefficient is low and viscosity is high. This novel
Nose-Hoover-Lowe-Andersen thermostat is Galilean invariant and preserves both
total linear and angular momentum of the system, due to the fact that the
thermostatic forces between each pair of the particles are pairwise additive
and central. We show by simulation that this thermostat also preserves
hydrodynamics. For the (non-interacting) ideal gas at P=0, the diffusion
coefficient diverges and viscosity is zero, while for P>0 it has a finite
value. By adjusting probability P, the Schmidt number can be varied by orders
of magnitude. The temperature deviation from the required value is at least an
order of magnitude smaller than in Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), while
the equilibrium properties of the system are very well reproduced. Applications
of this thermostat include all standard molecular dynamic simulations of dense
liquids and solids with any type of force field, as well as hydrodynamic
simulation of multi-phase systems with largely different bulk viscosities,
including surface viscosity, and of dilute gases and plasmas.

group are investigated under the aspect of the breakdown of the initial
symmetry group down to the Lorentz subgroup. We review the theory of
spontaneously broken de Sitter gravity by Stelle and West and apply a similar
approach to the case of the Poincare and affine groups. Especially, we find
that the groundstate of the metric affine theory leads to the determination of
the Lorentzian signature of the metric in the groundstate. We show that the
Higgs field remains in its groundstate, i.e., that the metric will have
Lorentzian signature, unless we introduce matter fields that explicitely couple
to the symmetric part of the connection. We also show that some features, like
the necessity of the introduction of a dilaton field, that seem artificial in
the context of the affine theory, appear most natural if the gauge group is
taken to be the special linear group in five dimensions. Finally, we present an
alternative model which is based on the spinor representation of the Lorentz
group and is especially adopted to the description of spinor fields in a
general linear covariant way, without the use of the infinite dimensional
representations which are usually considered to be unavoidable.

how small one can make a lattice without altering the physics beyond

lattice size should be greater than (ideally much greater than) four (i.e.,
$m_\pi L \gg 4$). By considering a relatively simple chiral quark model we are
led to suggest that a more realistic constraint would be $m_\pi (L - 2R) \gg
4$, where $R$ is the radius of the confinement region, which for these purposes
could be taken to be around 0.8-1.0 fm. Within the model we demonstrate that
violating the second condition can lead to unphysical behaviour of hadronic

particle motion. This allows us to find new sets of solutions where the
transversal motion is characterized by quantum numbers different from Volkov's
(in the Volkov solutions this motion is characterized by the transversal
momentum). In particular, we construct solutions with semiclassical transversal
charge motion (transversal squeezed coherent states). In addition, we
demonstrate how the plane-wave field can be eliminated from the transversal

colinear electric and magnetic fields). Thus, we find new sets of solutions of

involves Hamiltonian constraints as basic objects. One can see that the

established by A. Klein for weak disorder, in case U=0 and $V(\omega)$ given by

establishing the persistence of ac spectrum under weak disorder. The method
yields the continuity in the disorder parameter of the ac spectral density of

properties of symplectic coherent states and the corresponding Berezin-Toeplitz
quantization. Specifically, we study overcompleteness, symplectic analogues of
the basic properties of Bargmann's weighted analytic function spaces, and the
`maximally classical' behavior of symplectic coherent states. We also find
explicit formulas for symplectic coherent states on compact Riemann surfaces.

systems on an n-dimensional manifold with scalar input for any n>3 or with two
inputs for n=4 and n=5, up to state-feedback transformations, preserving the
affine structure. First using the Poincare series of moduli numbers we
introduce the intrinsic numbers of functional moduli of each prescribed number
of variables on which a classification problem depends. In order to classify
affine systems with scalar input we associate with such a system the canonical
frame by normalizing some structural functions in a commutative relation of the
vector fields, which define our control system. Then, using this canonical
frame, we introduce the canonical coordinates and find a complete system of
state-feedback invariants of the system. It also gives automatically the
micro-local (i.e. local in state-input space) classification of the generic
non-affine n-dimensional control system with scalar input for n>2. Further we
show how the problem of feedback-equivalence of affine systems with
two-dimensional input in state space of dimensions 4 and 5 can be reduced to
the same problem for affine systems with scalar input. In order to make this
reduction we distinguish the subsystem of our control system, consisting of the
directions of all extremals in dimension 4 and all abnormal extremals in
dimension 5 of the time optimal problem, defined by the original control
system. In each classification problem under consideration we find the
intrinsic numbers of functional moduli of each prescribed number of variables
according to its Poincare series.

of research settings to improve the management and control of large numbers of
interacting entities such as communication, computer and sensor networks,
satellite constellations and more. Attempts to take advantage of this paradigm
and mimic the behavior of insect swarms however often lead to many different
implementations of SI. The rather vague notions of what constitutes
self-organized behavior lead to rather ad hoc approaches that make it difficult
to ascertain just what SI is, assess its true potential and more fully take
advantage of it. This article provides a set of general principles for SI
research and development. A precise definition of self-organized behavior is
described and provides the basis for a more axiomatic and logical approach to
research and development as opposed to the more prevalent ad hoc approach in
using SI concepts. The concept of Pareto optimality is utilized to capture the
notions of efficiency and adaptability. A new concept, Scale Invariant Pareto
Optimality is described and entails symmetry relationships and scale invariance
where Pareto optimality is preserved under changes in system states. This
provides a mathematical way to describe efficient tradeoffs of efficiency
between different scales and further, mathematically captures the notion of the
graceful degradation of performance so often sought in complex systems.

undirected graph, because many quantities characterizing networks are defined
for undirected cases. For this undirected shareholding network, we show that a
degree distribution is well fitted by a power law function with an exponential
tail. The exponent in the power law range is gamma=1.8. We also show that the
spectrum of this network follows asymptotically the power law distribution with
the exponent delta=2.6. By comparison with gamma and delta, we find a scaling
relation delta=2gamma-1. The reason why this relation holds is attributed to
the local tree-like structure of networks. To clarify this structure, the
correlation between degrees and clustering coefficients is considered. We show
that this correlation is negative and fitted by the power law function with the
exponent alpha=1.1. This guarantees the local tree-like structure of the
network and suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure. We also show
that the degree correlation is negative and follows the power law function with
the exponent nu=0.8. This indicates a degree-nonassortative network, in which
hubs are not directly connected with each other. To understand these features
of the network from the viewpoint of a company's growth, we consider the

clarified that the degree and the company's total assets correlate strongly,

hot and a cold reservoir to extract work. Here both reservoirs are quantum
systems and a heat engine is described by a unitary transformation which
decreases the average energy of the bipartite system. On the molecular scale,
the ability of implementing such a unitary heat engine is closely connected to
the ability of performing logical operations and classical computing. This is
shown by several examples:
  (1) The most elementary heat engine is a SWAP-gate acting on 1 hot and 1 cold
two-level systems with different energy gaps.
  (2) An optimal unitary heat engine on a pair of 3-level systems can directly
implement OR and NOT gates, as well as copy operations. The ability to
implement this heat engine on each pair of 3-level systems taken from the hot
and the cold ensemble therefore allows universal classical computation.
  (3) Optimal heat engines operating on one hot and one cold oscillator mode
with different frequencies are able to calculate polynomials and roots
approximately.
  (4) An optimal heat engine acting on 1 hot and n cold 2-level systems with
different level spacings can even solve the NP-complete problem KNAPSACK.
Whereas it is already known that the determination of ground states of
interacting many-particle systems is NP-hard, the optimal heat engine is a
thermodynamic problem which is NP-hard even for n non-interacting spin systems.
This result suggest that there may be complexity-theoretic limitations on the
efficiency of molecular heat engines.
