041006 and its associated hypernova obtained over 65 days after detection (55
R-band epochs on 10 different nights). Our early data (t<4 days) joined with
published GCN data indicates a steepening decay, approaching F_nu ~t^{-0.6} at
early times (<<1 day) and F_nu ~t^{-1.3} at late times. The break at
t_b=0.16+-0.04 days is the earliest reported jet break among all GRB
afterglows. During our first night, we obtained 39 exposures spanning 2.15
hours from 0.62 to 0.71 days after the burst that reveal a smooth afterglow,
with an rms deviation of 0.024 mag from the local power-law fit, consistent
with photometric errors. After t~4 days, the decay slows considerably, and the
light curve remains approximately flat at R~24 mag for a month before decaying
by another magnitude to reach R~25 mag two months after the burst. This
``bump'' is well-fitted by a k-corrected light curve of SN1998bw, but only if
stretched by a factor of 1.38 in time. In comparison with the other GRB-related
SNe bumps, GRB 041006 stakes out new parameter space for GRB/SNe, with a very
bright and significantly stretched late-time SN light curve. Within a small
sample of fairly well observed GRB/SN bumps, we see a hint of a possible
correlation between their peak luminosity and their ``stretch factor'', broadly
similar to the well-studied Phillips relation for the type Ia supernovae.

observations of the young, compact planetary nebula (PN) SwSt 1 along the line
of sight to its central star HD 167362. We detect circumstellar absorption
lines from several species against the continuum of the central star. The
physical parameters of the nebula derived from the FUSE data differ
significantly from those found from emission lines. We derive an electron
density n_e = 8800^{+4800}_{-2400} cm^{-3} from the column density ratio of the
excited S III fine structure levels, which is at least a factor of 3 lower than
all prior estimates. The gaseous iron abundance derived from the UV lines is
quite high ([Fe/S] = -0.35+/-0.12), which implies that iron is not
significantly depleted into dust. In contrast, optical and near-infrared
emission lines indicate that Fe is more strongly depleted: [Fe/H] =
-1.64+/-0.24 and [Fe/S] = -1.15+/-0.33. We do not detect nebular H_2
absorption, to a limit N(H_2) < 7\times10^14 cm^{-2}, at least four orders of
magnitude lower than the column density estimated from infrared H_2 emission
lines. Taken together, the lack of H_2 absorption, low n_e, and high gaseous Fe
abundance derived from the FUSE spectrum provide strong evidence that dense
structures (which can shield molecules and dust from the destructive effects of
energetic stellar photons) are not present along the line of sight to the
central star. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence for dust,
molecular material, and dense gas elsewhere in SwSt 1. Therefore, we conclude
that the nebula must have an inhomogeneous structure.

discrepancy between mass estimates derived from X-ray and strong lensing
analyses. With the present XMM observation, we trace the gas density and
temperature profiles out to a radius of ~ 1400 h_70^-1 kpc (approximately the
virial radius of the cluster). The surface brightness profile is well fitted
over three orders of magnitude with a beta model, with a core radius of 0.'95
and \beta=0.63. The projected temperature profile declines steeply with radius
(by ~50%), and is well described by a polytrope with parameters t_0=8.09 keV
and \gamma=1.15. The temperature map shows a pronounced peak in the central
arcminute, with an increase of a factor of two (from ~5 to ~10 keV). The mass
profile, calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry, is
best fitted with a King approximation to an isothermal sphere, implying a dark
matter distribution with a central core, in contrast with the cusped cores
found in more obviously relaxed clusters. The X-ray mass is two times less than
the strong lensing mass at r ~ 80 h_50^-1 kpc, although the agreement between
X-ray and weak lensing mass measurements at larger radius (r ~ 400 h_50^-1 kpc)
is slightly better. While the X-ray total mass estimates can vary by 30%
depending on the mass model, all measurements are lower than the corresponding
total mass from optical measurements. Given the X-ray results indicating
disturbance of the intracluster gas, leading to a likely violation of the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and the observed substructure in the
optical, suggesting a line-of-sight merger, it is unlikely that the different
mass estimates of this cluster can be reconciled, at least with standard
modelling assumptions.

absorption lines through fluorescence. Contrary to some claims in the
literature, the spectral features of XX Oph and AS 325 are quite similar,
evidence that they are comparable systems. We examine the variability of the
spectral morphology and radial velocity motions of both sources. We also study
the variability of XX Oph during a major photometric event and find that the
spectral nature of the system varies during the event. A comparison of the
velocity of the absorption line components in our new spectra with those in the
literature show that the structure of the stellar wind from XX Oph has changed
since the system was observed in 1951.

new 10-cm receiver at the Parkes telescope. We have exploited the low system
temperature and high bandwidth of the receiver to obtain profiles which have
good signal to noise for most of our sample at this relatively high frequency.
Although, as expected, a number of profiles are less linearly polarised at 3.1
GHz than at lower frequencies, we identify some pulsars and particular
components of profiles in other pulsars which have increased linear
polarisation at this frequency. We discuss the dependence of linear
polarisation with frequency in the context of a model in which emission
consists of the superposition of two, orthogonally polarised modes. We show
that a simple model, in which the orthogonal modes have different spectral
indices, can explain many of the observed properties of the frequency evolution
of both the linear polarisation and the total power, such as the high degree of
linear polarisation seen at all frequencies in some high spin-down, young
pulsars. Nearly all the position angle profiles show deviations from the
rotating vector model; this appears to be a general feature of high-frequency
polarisation observations.

background by parallel propagating plasma waves with a general broken power-law
spectrum that takes into account the turbulence generation processes at large
scales and the thermal damping effects at small scales. The exact dispersion
relation for a cold plasma is used to describe the relevant wave modes. Because
low-energy $\alpha$-particles only interact with small scale waves in the
$^4$He-cyclotron branch, where the wave frequencies are below the
$\alpha$-particle gyro-frequency, their pitch angle averaged acceleration time
is at least one order of magnitude longer than that of $^3$He ions, which
mostly resonate with relatively higher frequency waves in the proton-cyclotron
(PC) branch. The $\alpha$-particle acceleration rate starts to approach that of
$^3$He beyond a few tens of keV nucleon$^{-1}$, where $\alpha$-particles can
also interact with long wavelength waves in the PC branch. However, the $^4$He
acceleration rate is always smaller than that of $^3$He. Consequently, the
acceleration of $^4$He is suppressed significantly at low energies, and the
spectrum of the accelerated $\alpha$-particles is always softer than that of
$^3$He. The model gives reasonable account of the observed low-energy $^3$He
and $^4$He fluxes and spectra in the impulsive solar energetic particle events

atmosphere is established. It is shown that a primary plasma flow (locally
sub-Alfv\'enic) is accelerated when interacting with emerging/ambient
arcade--like closed field structures. The acceleration implies a conversion of
thermal and field energies to kinetic energy of the flow. The time-scale for
creating reasonably fast flows ($\gtrsim 100$ km/s) is dictated by the initial
ion skin depth while the amplification of the flow depends on local $\beta $.
It is shown, for the first time, that distances over which the flows become
""fast"" are $\sim 0.01 R_s$ from the interaction surface; later the fast flow
localizes (with dimensions $\lesssim 0.05 R_S$) in the upper central region of

500 km/s$) of the accelerated flow, and the modification of the field structure
are independent of the time-duration (life-time) of the initial flow. In the
presence of dissipation, these flows are likely to play a fundamental role in
the heating of the finely structured Solar atmosphere.

manifestation of low-rate or low-radiative-efficiency accretion onto
supermassive central black holes. However, it has been unclear whether the
compact UV nuclear sources present in many LINERs are clusters of massive
stars, rather than being directly related to the accretion process. We have
used HST to monitor the UV variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with LINER
nuclei and compact nuclear UV sources. Fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observed
more than once, with two to five epochs per galaxy, spanning up to a year. We
detect significant variability in most of the sample, with peak-to-peak
amplitudes from a few percent to 50%. In most cases, correlated variations are
seen in two independent bands (F250W and F330W). Comparison to previous UV
measurements indicates, for many objects, long-term variations by factors of a
few over decade timescales. Variability is detected in LINERs with and without
detected compact radio cores, in LINERs that have broad H-alpha wings detected
in their optical spectra (``LINER 1's''), and in those that do not (``LINER
2s''). This variability demonstrates the existence of a non-stellar component
in the UV continuum of all types, and sets a lower limit to the luminosity of
this component. We note a trend in the UV color (F250W/F330W) with spectral
type - LINER 1s tend to be bluer than LINER 2s. This trend may indicate a link
between the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or the
visibility of a broad-line region. In one target, the post-starburst galaxy NGC
4736, we detect variability in a previously noted UV source that is offset by
2.5"" (60 pc in projection) from the nucleus. This may be the nearest example of
a binary active nucleus, and of the process leading to black hole merging.

measuring the resistance to counterflow current. For a geometry in which

are almost exlusively based on ground state calculations in the local-density

optimised-effective potential approach (OEPx). This is a much more elaborate

pseudopotentials in order to treat core-valence exchange consistently. Our OEPx
based quasiparticle valence bandstructures are in good agreement with available
photoemission data in contrast to the ones based on the LDA. We therefore
conclude that for these materials OEPx constitutes the better starting point

In_{1-x}Ga_{x}As/GaAs dots depend on their shape, height and alloy
compositions, these characteristics are often not known accurately from
experiment. This creates a difficulty in comparing measured electronic and
spectroscopic properties with calculated ones. Since simplified theoretical
models (effective mass, k.p, parabolic models) do not fully convey the effects
of shape, size and composition on the electronic and spectroscopic properties,
we offer to bridge the gap by providing accurately calculated results as a
function of the dot height and composition. Prominent results are the
following. (i) Regardless of height and composition, the electron levels form
shells of nearly degenerate states. In contrast, the hole levels form shells
only in flat dots and near the highest hole level (HOMO). (ii) In alloy dots,
the electrons' ``s-p'' splitting depends weakly on height, while the ``p-p''
splitting depends non-monotonically. In non-alloyed InAs/GaAs dots, both these
splittings depend weakly on height. For holes in alloy dots, the ``s-p''
splitting decreases with increasing height, whereas the ``p-p'' splitting
remains nearly unchaged. Shallow, non-alloyed dots have a ``s-p'' splitting of
nearly the same magnitude, whereas the ``p-p'' splitting is larger. (iii) As
height increases, the ``s'' and ``p'' character of the wavefunction of the HOMO
becomes mixed, and so does the heavy- and light-hole character. (iv) In alloy
dots, low-lying hole states are localized inside the dot. Remarkably, in
non-alloyed InAs/GaAs dots these states become localized at the interface as
height increases. This localization is driven by the biaxial strain present in
the nanostructure.

Rip in the SO(1,1) model may be treated as either the transition point of
universe from expansion to extract phase or the final state. In the latter
picture of the universe, the field has the $T$ symmetry and the scale factor
possesses the $CT$ symmetry, for which the SO(1,1) charge $\bar{Q}$ plays a
crucial role.

model (MSSM) soft terms inspired by flux-induced supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking
in Type IIB string orientifolds. The scheme is extremely constrained with
essentially only two free mass parameters: a parameter M, which sets the scale
of soft terms, and the mu parameter. After imposing consistent radiative
electro-weak symmetry breaking (EWSB) the model depends upon one mass parameter
(say, M). In spite of being so constrained one finds consistency with EWSB
conditions. We demonstrate that those conditions have two solutions for mu<0,
and none for mu>0. The parameter tan beta results as a prediction and is
approximately 3-5 for one solution, and 25-40 for the other, depending upon M
and the top mass. We examine further constraints on the model coming from b->s
gamma, the muon g-2, Higgs mass limits and WMAP constraints on dark matter. The
MSSM spectrum is predicted in terms of the single free parameter M. The low tan
beta branch is consistent with a relatively light spectrum although it is
compatible with standard cosmology only if the lightest neutralino is unstable.
The high tan beta branch is compatible with all phenomenological constraints,
but has quite a heavy spectrum. We argue that the fine-tuning associated to
this heavy spectrum would be substantially ameliorated if an additional
relationship mu=-2M were present in the underlying theory.

no new parameters, barring the few SUSY parameters, which are assumed to be
flavor-universal at M^*>= M_{GUT}. We study LFV (i.e. \mu -> e\gamma, \tau ->
\mu\gamma, \tau -> e\gamma and \mu N -> e N) within this framework by including
contributions both from the presence of the right handed neutrinos as well as
those arising from renormalization group running in the post-GUT regime (M^* to
M_{GUT}). Typically the latter, though commonly omitted in the literature, is
found to dominate. Our predicted rates for \mu -> e\gamma show that while some
choices of (m_o, m_{1/2}) are clearly excluded by the current empirical limit,
this decay should be seen with an improvement of the current sensitivity by a
factor of 10--100, even if sleptons are moderately heavy (<= 800 GeV, say). For
the same reason, \mu-e conversion (\mu N -> e N) should show in the planned

over relatively short neutrino path lengths in the Earth, and also of
asymmetric profiles. We study the requirements that future experiments must
meet to achieve a given accuracy of the tomography of the Earth.

  Analysis",,,,"math.NA",,"  We present a sublinear randomized algorithm to compute a sparse Fourier
transform for nonequispaced data. Suppose a signal S is known to consist of N
equispaced samples, of which only L<N are available. If the ratio p=L/N is not
close to 1, the available data are typically non-equispaced samples. Then our
algorithm reconstructs a near-optimal B-term representation R with high
probability 1-delta, in time and space poly(B,log(L),log p, log(1/delta),
epsilon^{-1}, such that ||S-R||^2 < (1+epsilon) ||S-R_{opt}^B||^2, where
R_{opt}^B is the optimal B-term Fourier representation of signal S. The
sublinear poly(logL) time is compared to the superlinear O(Nlog N+L) time
requirement of the present best known Inverse Nonequispaced Fast Fourier
Transform (INFFT) algorithms. Numerical experiments support the advantage in
speed of our algorithm over other methods for sparse signals: it already
outperforms INFFT for large but realistic size N and works well even in the
situation of a large percentage of missing data and in the presence of noise.

($S_r$, $S_k$, $S$) are evaluated for many nuclei using ""experimental""

harmonic oscillator model and with the short-range correlated distributions. It
is found that $S_r$ depends strongly on $\ln A$ and does not depend very much
on the model. The behaviour of $S_k$ is opposite. The various cases we consider
can be classified according to either the quantity of the experimental data we
use or by the values of $S$, i.e., the increase of the quality of the density
and of the momentum distributions leads to an increase of the values of $S$. In
all cases, apart from the linear relation $S=a+b\ln A$, the linear relation
$S=a_V+b_V \ln V$ also holds. V is the mean volume of the nucleus. If $S$ is
considered as an ensemble entropy, a relation between $A$ or $V$ and the
ensemble volume can be found. Finally, comparing different electron scattering
experiments for the same nucleus, it is found that the larger the momentum
transfer ranges, the larger the information entropy is. It is concluded that
$S$ could be used to compare different experiments for the same nucleus and to
choose the most reliable one.

insoluble amyloid fibrils relies not only on its medical consequences, but also
on its more basic properties of self--organization. The discovery that a large
number of uncorrelated proteins can form, under proper conditions, structurally
similar fibrils has suggested that the underlying mechanism is a general
feature of polypeptide chains. In the present work, we address the early events
preceeding amyloid fibril formation in solutions of zinc--free human insulin
incubated at low pH and high temperature. Aside from being a easy--to--handle
model for protein fibrillation, subcutaneous aggregation of insulin after
injection is a nuisance which affects patients with diabetes. Here, we show by
time--lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) that a steady-state distribution of
protein oligomers with an exponential tail is reached within few minutes after
heating. This metastable phase lasts for few hours until aggregation into
fibrils suddenly occurs. A theoretical explanation of the oligomer
pre--fibrillar distribution is given in terms of a simple
coagulation--evaporation kinetic model, in which concentration plays the role
of a critical parameter. Due to high resolution and sensitivity of AFM
technique, the observation of a long-lasting latency time should be considered
an actual feature of the aggregation process, and not simply ascribed to
instrumental inefficency. These experimental facts, along with the kinetic
model used, claim for a critical role of thermal concentration fluctuations in
the process of fibril nucleation.

speed up the implementation of modules of quantum algorithms or quantum

shortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology as well as on the
characteristicratio of the time scales for local controls {\em vs} non-local
({\em i.e.} coupling) evolutions in the specific experimental setting. Relating
these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper
bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown,
time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the
usual gate complexity.
