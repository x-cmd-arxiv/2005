constructed from the Ghirlanda et al. power-law relation between the
geometry-corrected energy (E_gamma) and the peak of the rest-frame prompt burst
spectrum (E_p) is not yet cosmographically useful, despite holding some
potential advantages over SNe Ia. This is due largely to the small sample of
\~20 GRBs with the required measured redshifts, jet-breaks, and peak energies,
and to the strong sensitivity of the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to input
assumptions. The most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to the
generally unknown density (and density profile), of the circumburst medium.
Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a highly significant correlation over many
cosmologies, until the sample expands to include many low-z events, it will be
most sensitive to Omega_M but essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda and w,
with some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z GRB data alone. The relation
clearly represents a significant improvement in the search for an empirical GRB
standard candle, but is further hindered by an unknown physical basis for the
relation, the lack of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in a
cosmology-independent way, and several major potential systematic uncertainties
and selection effects. Until these concerns are addressed, a larger sample is
acquired, and attempts are made to marginalize or perform Monte Carlo
simulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography and especially the attempts to
combine GRBs with SNe Ia.

along the radial direction and are ultrarelativistic (that is, they have speeds
above c/sqrt(2)) decelerate toward this terminal speed. On the other hand, the
swarm particles that are ultrarelativistic and move in directions normal to the
radial (jet) directions accelerate to almost the speed of light by the
gravitational tidal force of the mass M. The implications of these effects as

tidal tails of NGC 6872. We find star clusters with ages between 1 - 100 Myr
distributed in the tidal tails, while the tails themselves have an age of less
than 150 Myr. Most of the young massive ($10^{4} \le M/M_{\odot} \le 10^{7}$)
clusters are found in the outer regions of the galactic disk or the tidal
tails. The mass distribution of the cluster population can be well described by
power-law of the form $N(m) \propto m^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha = 1.85 \pm
0.11$, in very good agreement with other young cluster populations found in a
variety of different environments. We estimate the star formation rate for
three separate regions of the galaxy, and find that the eastern tail is forming
stars at $\sim 2$ times the rate of the western tail and $\sim 5$ times the
rate of the main body of the galaxy. By comparing our observations with
published N-body models of the fate of material in tidal tails in a galaxy
cluster potential, we see that many of these young clusters will be lost into
the intergalactic medium. We speculate that this mechanism may also be at work
in larger galaxy clusters such as Fornax, and suggest that the so-called
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could be the most massive star clusters that have
formed in the tidal tails of an ancient galactic merger.

adequately in literature. We found out, Josephson Junction (JJ) decoupling is
the main origin of the AC resistivity in high Tc superconductors. We have
measured the AC resistivity in the superconductors in the low frequency range
by measuring the complex AC impedance of superconducting YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO)
polycrystalline samples. Our data shows that under certain conditions when the
number density of Josephson Junctions (JJ) present in the sample and the JJ
critical current crosses a threshold value, AC resistivity in the
superconducting state keeps on increasing with lowering temperature. The
underlying mechanism is an interesting interplay of JJ coupling energy,
amplitude of the supply AC voltage and the current applied to the
superconducting sample. The effect of the applied AC current of different
frequencies and the variation of temperature were studied in detail. To find
out the exact relation between the JJ coupling energy, JJ number density,
applied AC frequency, the amplitude of AC current and the AC resistivity in the

with different pressure and sintered at different physical situations. These
results have important implications for the understanding of the origin of AC
resistivity and characterization of superconducting samples. In this paper we
also extend the capability of the AC impedance studies in superconductors for
the characterization of materials for device applications.

is general and applicable to a variety of scattering and tunneling problems. As
the first application, the problem of pair tunneling through a weak link on a

pair tunnels much easier than one particle, with the transmission coefficient
approaching unity. This anomalously high transmission is a consequence of the
existence of a two-body resonant state localized at the weak link.

it varies nonmonotonically. We also show that in contrast to the charge current
Fano factor, which varies appreciable only in the antiparallel case, the spin

  density functional theory","2 figures",,"10.1063/1.1924599",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Long-range charge transfer excited states are notoriously badly
underestimated in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We resolve
how {\it exact} TDDFT captures charge transfer between open-shell species: in
particular the role of the step in the ground-state potential, and the severe
frequency-dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel. An expression for the
latter is derived, that becomes exact in the limit that the charge-transfer
excitations are well-separated from other excitations. The exchange-correlation
kernel has the task of undoing the static correlation in the ground state
introduced by the step, in order to accurately recover the physical
charge-transfer states.

equations, and give starting equations for understanding the instability
phenomena of laminar flows and transition to turbulence. It is considered that
there is an interaction between the disturbance and the base flow in the
process of disturbance amplification. The transition to turbulence is the
result of this interaction. The linearity of the disturbance in linear theory
is oversimplified the problem. It is pointed out that the development of
disturbance is subjected to the influence of the base flow, and these effects
must be included in the governing equations of the disturbance.

control, there must be a way to not only manipulate single qubits after
creation and before measurement, but a way to characterize the manipulations
