well-localized short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). None of the six error boxes
reveals the presence of a plausible nearby host galaxy. This allows us to set
lower limits on the distances and, hence, the isotropic-equivalent energy of
these GRBs. Our lower limits are around $1 \times 10^{49}$ erg (at $2\sigma$
confidence level); as a consequence, some of the short-hard GRBs we examine
would have been detected by BATSE out to distances greater than 1 Gpc and
therefore constitute a bona fide cosmological population. Our search is
partially motivated by the December 27, 2004 hypergiant flare from SGR 1806-20,
and the intriguing possibility that short-hard GRBs are extragalactic events of
a similar nature. Such events would be detectable with BATSE to a distance of
\~50 Mpc, and their detection rate should be comparable to the actual BATSE
detection rate of short-hard GRBs. The failure of our search, by contrast,
suggests that such flares constitute less than 15% of the short-hard GRBs (<40%
at 95% confidence). We discuss possible resolutions of this discrepancy.

depends on the point in space chosen as the target for the propagation

contrast to the intrinsic cusps ($\alpha_{int}\sim1$) predicted by simulations
of halo assembly in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies. To elucidate the
relationship between $\alpha_m$ and $\alpha_{int}$ in our data, we simulate
long-slit observations of model galaxies with halo shapes broadly consistent
with the CDM paradigm. Simulations with $\alpha_{int}=1/2$ and 1 recover both
the observed distribution of $\alpha_m$ and correlations between $\alpha_m$ and
primary observational parameters such as distance and disk inclination, whereas
those with $\alpha_{int}=5/4$ are marginally consistent with the data.
Conversely, the hypothesis that low-mass galaxies have $\alpha_{int}=3/2$ is
rejected. While the simulations do not imply that the data favor intrinsic
cusps over cores, they demonstrate that the discrepancy between $\alpha_m$ and
$\alpha_{int}\sim1$ for our sample does not necessarily imply a genuine
conflict between our results and CDM predictions: rather, the apparent
cusp/core problem may be reconciled by considering the impact of observing and

cannot account for the instability of BHL accretion at moderate Mach number

advective-acoustic instability is considered in the context of BHL accretion
when the shock is detached from the accretor. This mechanism naturally explains
the stability of the flow when the shock is weak, and the instability when the
accretor is small. In particular, it is a robust proof of the instability of 3D
accretion when gamma=5/3 if the accretor is small enough, even for moderate
shock strength (M sim 3). The numerical artefacts that may be present in
existing numerical simulations are reviewed, with particular attention paid to
the advection of entropy/vorticity perturbations and the artificial acoustic

introduced color maps in recognizing galaxies and properly classified
morphologies of 36 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, Lir(8-1000um)>=10^11
L_sun). Here we presented morphological classification of a parallel 75
non-LIRG sample. Our examination revealed that a significant fraction of the
galaxies shows remarkable morphological evolution, most likely related to the
present-day spiral galaxies. Comparison of the morphological properties between
LIRGs and non-LIRGs shows that the LIRGs contain a higher fraction of ongoing
major mergers and systems with signs of merging/interaction. This suggests that
the merging process is one of the major mechanisms to trigger star formation.
We found that spiral LIRGs probably host much fewer bars than spiral non-LIRGs,
suggesting that a bar is not efficient in triggering violent star formation.
Differing from Abraham et al. (1999), no dramatic change of the bar frequency
is detected up to redshift ~0.8. The bar frequency of the distant spirals is
similar to (and may be higher than) the present-day spirals in the rest-frame
$B$ band. We conclude that bar-driven secular evolution is not a major
mechanism to drive morphological evolution of field galaxies, especially their
bulge formation, which is more likely related to multiple intense star
formation episodes during which the galaxies appear as LIRGs (Hammer et al.
2005).

in which many cooling and heating processes are involved. However, it has long
been recognized that the growth mode dynamics of cosmic matter clustering can
be sketched by a random force driven Burgers' equation if cooling and heating
are ignored. Just how well the dynamics of the IGM can be described as a
Burgers fluid has not been fully investigated probably because cooling and
heating are essential for a detailed understanding of the IGM. Using IGM
samples produced by a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in which heating and
cooling processes are properly accounted for, we show that the IGM velocity
field in the nonlinear regime shows the features of a Burgers fluid, that is,
when the Reynolds number is high, the velocity field consists of an ensemble of
shocks. Consequently, (1) the IGM velocity $v$ is generally smaller than that
of dark matter; (2) for the smoothed field, the IGM velocity shows tight
correlation with dark matter given by $v \simeq s v_{dm}$, with $s<1$, such
that the lower the redshift, the smaller $s$; (3) the velocity PDFs are
asymmetric between acceleration and deceleration events; (4) the PDF of
velocity difference $\Delta v=v(x+r)-v(x)$ satisfies the scaling relation for a
Burgers fluid, i.e., $P(\Delta v)=(1 r^y)F(\Delta v/r^y)$. We find the scaling
function and parameters for the IGM which are applicable to the entire scale
range of the samples (0.26 - 8 h$^{-1}$ Mpc). These properties show that the
similarity mapping between the IGM and dark matter is violated on scales much
larger than the Jeans length of the IGM.

reliable metallicity determinations which compare generally very well with
ground-based integrated spectroscopic and photometric measures, as well as
giving good reddening estimates. 2. The HB morphologies show the same behavior
with metallicity as the Galactic GCs, with indications that the 2nd-parameter
effect can be present in some GCs of our sample. However, at [Fe/H] ~ -1.7 we
observe a number of GCs with red HB morphology such that the HB type versus

with the largest number of direct angular diameter determinations, achieved
over a long time by several authors using various techniques. In spite of this
wealth of data, or perhaps as a direct result of it, there is not a very good
agreement on a single angular diameter value. This is particularly unsettling
if one considers that Aldebaran is also used as a primary calibrator for some
angular resolution methods, notably for optical and infrared long baseline
interferometry. Directly connected to Aldebaran's angular diameter and its
uncertainties is its effective temperature, which also has been used for
several empirical calibrations. Among the proposed explanations for the
elusiveness of an accurate determination of the angular diameter of Aldebaran
are the possibility of temporal variations as well as a possible dependence of
the angular diameter on the wavelength. We present here a few, very accurate
new determinations obtained by means of lunar occultations and long baseline
interferometry. We derive an average value of 19.96+-0.03 milliarcseconds for
the uniform disk diameter. The corresponding limb-darkened value is 20.58+-0.03
milliarcseconds, or 44.2+-0.9 R(sun). We discuss this result, in connection
with previous determinations and with possible problems that may affect such
measurements.

believed to be a surface distribution of matter whose nuclear composition may
depend on position. Its evolution during compression beyond the neutron-drip
threshold density is determined by the presence of nuclear formation enthalpy
minima at the proton closed shells. At threshold, a sequence of weak
interactions with capture or emission of neutron pairs rapidly transform nuclei
to the most accessible proton closed shell. Therefore, angular asymmetries in
nuclear composition present in accreted matter at neutron drip are preserved
during further compression to higher densities provided transition rates
between closed shells are negligible. Although it has been confirmed that this
condition is satisfied for predicted internal temperatures and for the
formation enthalpy distribution used in this work, it would not be so if the
true enthalpy differences between maxima and minima in the distribution were a
factor of two smaller. For this reason, it does not appear possible to assert
with any confidence that position-dependent surface composition can lead to
significant angle-dependence of the equation of state and to potentially
observable gravitational radiation. The effect of non-radial internal
temperature gradients on angle-dependency of the equation of state is also not
quantifiable.

synchrotron self-Compton modelling, of the radio-to-X-ray spectral energy
distribution. However, we cannot rule out a contribution from an accretion

are possible but require extreme parameters. We detect thermal emission on both

Uncertainties in the age distribution of local field stars make reliable
inference complicated. We adopt a wide range of plausible assumptions about the
rate of galactic star formation and show that their deviations from a uniform
rate produce little effect on the resulting luminosity function for a given
mass function. We use a Bayesian statistical formalism to evaluate the
probability of commonly used mass functions in light of recent discoveries. We
consider three functional forms of the mass function, include a two-segment
power law, a single power law with a low-mass cutoff, and a log-normal
distribution. Our results show that, at a 60% confidence level, the power-law
index, $\alpha$, for the low-mass arm of a two-segment power law has a value
between -0.5 and 0.5 for objects with masses between $0.04 M_{\odot}$ and $0.10
M_{\odot}$. The best-fit index is $\alpha = 0.3\pm0.6$ at the 60% confidence
level for a single-segment mass function. Current data require this function
extend to at least $0.05 M_{\odot}$ with no restrictions placed on a lower mass
cutoff. Inferences of the parameter values for a log-normal mass function are
virtually unaffected by recent estimates of the local space density of L and T
dwarfs. We find no preference among these three forms using this method. We
discuss current and future capabilities that may eventually discriminate
between mass-function models and refine estimates of their associated parameter
values.

lattices, it is possible to estimate a very regular exponential growth of this
number vs. the size. Looking at other features, the toppling invariants exhibit
a highly irregular behavior. The usual constraint on the energy positiveness
introduces a transition in the frozen phase. In correspondence to this
transition, a dynamical crossover related to the halting times is observed. The
analysis of the configuration space shows that the DFES has a different
structure with respect to dissipative BTW and stochastic sandpiles models,
supporting the conjecture that it lies in a distinct class of universality.

biased by the external field and pile up vertically on the physical 2d lattice,
then execute hard-core biased random walks on a transformed 1d lattice. Their
density obeys a nonlinear diffusion equation which can be transformed into the
standard expression for the interface velocity v = M[(gamma + gamma'')kappa +

anisotropic curvature-driven motion. In this generalization, both the interface
stiffness tensor and the curvature tensor are singular at the <100>

increasing Ti content to its minimum value at x=0.15 at room temperature. Below
the Curie temperature T_C, the resistance exhibits metallic behavior for the x

decreases the 2p-3d hybridization between O and Mn ions, reduces the bandwidth
W, and increases the electron-phonon coupling. Therefore, the TC shifts to a
lower temperature and the resistivity increases with increasing Ti content. A

recently about the stability of the NLO analysis with respect to certain

parametrization of the gluon distribution. In this paper, we investigate this
stability issue systematically within the CTEQ framework. We find that both the
PDFs and their physical predictions are stable, well within the few percent
level. Further, we have applied the Lagrange Multiplier method to explore the
stability of the predicted cross sections for W production at the Tevatron and
the LHC, since W production is often proposed as a standard candle for these
colliders. We find the NLO predictions on sigma_W to be stable well within
their previously-estimated uncertainty ranges.

establishes a graphical correspondence between neutrino mass models and
geometrical configurations, particularly useful to study relevant aspects of
leptogenesis. We first derive the CP asymmetry bound for hierarchical heavy
neutrinos and then an expression for the effective leptogenesis phase,
determining the conditions for maximal phase and placing a lower bound on the
phase suppression for generic models. Reconsidering the lower bounds on the
lightest right-handed (RH) neutrino mass M_1 and on the reheating temperature
T_reh, we find that models where one of the two heavier neutrino masses is
dominated by the lightest right-handed (RH) neutrinos, typically arising from
connections with quark masses, undergo both phase suppression and strong
wash-out such that M_1 (T_reh)\gtrsim 10^{11} (10^{10}) GeV. The window 10^9
GeV \lesssim M_1,T_reh \lesssim 10^{10}GeV is accessible only for a class of
models where m_1 is dominated by the lightest RH neutrino, with no
straightforward connections with quark masses. Within this class we describe a
new scenario of thermal leptogenesis where the baryon asymmetry of the Universe
is generated by the decays of the second lightest RH neutrino, such that the
lower bound on M_1 disappears and is replaced by a lower bound on M_2.
Interestingly, the final asymmetry is independent on the initial conditions. We
also discuss the validity of the approximation of hierarchical heavy neutrinos
in a simple analytical way.

result interpolates smoothly between the previously known extreme small and

single instanton background has radial symmetry, so that the computation can be
reduced to a sum over partial waves of logarithms of radial determinants, each
of which can be computed numerically in an efficient manner. The bare sum over
partial waves is divergent and must be regulated and renormalized. In this
paper we provide more details of this computation, including both the

dimensions are studied in a manifestly supersymmetric setting of the superfield
formalism. A close examination of the supercurrent that accommodates the
central charge and super-Poincare charges in a supermultiplet reveals that
there is no genuine quantum anomaly in the supertrace identity and in the
supercharge algebra, with the central-charge operator given by the bare
Fayet-Iliopoulos term alone. The central charge and the vortex spectrum undergo
renormalization on taking the expectation value of the central-charge operator.
It is shown that the vortex spectrum is exactly determined at one loop while
the spectrum of the elementary excitations receives higher-order corrections.

result, due to Viada and R\'emond-Viada (who was able to prove the conjecture
for power of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication). The proof is based
on the strategy of R\'emond (following Bombieri, Masser and Zannier) with two
new ingredients, one of them, being at the heart of this article : it is a
lower bound for the N\'eron-Tate height of points on Abelian varieties $A/K$ of
C.M. type in the spirit of Lehmer's problem. This lower bound is an analog of
the similar result of Amoroso and David \cite{ad2003} on $\G_m^n$ and is a
generalisation of the theorem of David and Hindry \cite{davidhindry} on the
abelian Lehmer's problem. The proof is an adaptation of \cite{davidhindry}
using in our abelian case the new ideas introduced in \cite{ad2003}.
Furthermore, as in \cite{ad2003} and adapting in the abelian case their proof,
we give another application of our result : a lower bound for the absolute
minimum of a subvariety $V$ of $A$. Although lower bounds for this minimum were
already known (decreasing multi-exponential function of the degree for
Bombieri-Zannier), our methods enable us to prove, up to an $\epsilon$ the
optimal result that can be conjectured.

derive analytical expressions which relate the values of key statistics,
notably determinism and entropy of line length distribution, to the correlation
sum as a function of embedding dimension. These expressions are obtained by
deriving the transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an
unembedded plot. A single unembedded recurrence plot thus provides the
statistics of all possible embedded recurrence plots. If the correlation sum
scales exponentially with embedding dimension, we show that these statistics
are determined entirely by the exponent of the exponential. This explains the
results of Iwanski and Bradley (Chaos 8 [1998] 861-871) who found that certain
recurrence plot statistics are apparently invariant to embedding dimension for
certain low-dimensional systems. We also examine the relationship between the
mutual information content of two timeseries and the common recurrent structure
seen in their recurrence plots. This allows time-localized contributions to
mutual information to be visualized. This technique is demonstrated using
geomagnetic index data; we show that the AU and AL geomagnetic indices share
