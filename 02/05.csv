most luminous star cluster known to date with a dynamical mass estimate of 8
+/- 2 x 10^7 M_sun. With an effective radius of about 17.5 pc and a velocity
dispersion of 45 km/s this object may be viewed as one of the recently
discovered ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Its intermediate age, however,
precludes an origin as a stripped nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. The galaxy
NGC 7252 is a merger remnant from two gas-rich disc galaxies. Interactions
between two gas-rich galaxies lead to bursts of intense star formation. The age
of the interaction and the age of W3 are in good agreement, suggesting that was
W3 probably formed in the starburst. We propose a formation scenario for W3.
Observations of interacting galaxies reveal regions of strong star formation
forming dozens up to hundreds of star cluster in confined regions of up to
several hundred parsec in diameter. The total mass of new stars in these
regions can reach 10^7 or even 10^8 M_sun. By means of numerical simulations we
have shown that the star clusters in these regions merge on short time-scales
of a few Myr up to a few hundred Myr. We apply this scenario to W3 and predict
properties which could be observable and the future evolution of this object.
This work lends credence to the notion that at least some of the UCDs may be
evolved star cluster complexes formed during early hierarchical mergers.

distribution of a million or so galaxies over a large cosmological volume.
Visually galaxies appear to be distributed along sheet-like and/or filamentary
superclusters. The CfA Great Wall, Southern Great Wall and the recently
discovered SDSS Great Wall are very spectacular superclusters. Clearly
theoretical predictions for galaxy clustering must be tested against these rich
datasets. This can be achieved by means of the Minkowski Functionals (MFs). A
MF-based approach provides an excellent description of superclusters and voids
and allows one to quantify the properties of the cosmic web. In this review we
give a summary of the progress made in this direction. After reviewing the
status of observations and of numerical simulations, we comment upon the nature
of bias which serves as a link between theoretical predictions and
observations. We also summarise the methods developed for efficient numerical
estimation of MFs for cosmological datasets and list several important results
obtained using these methods. Specifically, we stress the discriminatory power
of MFs and of the derived morphological statistics, the Shapefinders.
Shapefinders are an excellent tool with which to study the shapes and sizes of
superclusters and voids. We also discuss some of the important effects of
scale-dependent bias which are brought out by a MF-based study of the mock
catalogues of galaxies. Such effects, we note, should be accounted for before
comparing theoretical models with observations.

produce the higher ionization emission seen across the broad maximum. This

continuum of unknown origin. We propose that it is emitted by the driving
millimeter source, escapes the core through tunnels, and illuminates features
aligning the outflow. Narrow-band flux measurements of these features contain
an unusually large amount of continuum emission. [Fe II] emission has been
detected and is restricted to isolated condensations. However, the
characteristics of vibrational excitation of molecular hydrogen resemble those
of older molecular outflows. We attempt to model the ordered structure of the
western outflow as a series of shocks, finding that bow shocks with J-type
dissociative apices and C-type flanks are consistent. Moreover, essentially the
same conditions are predicted for all three bows except for a systematic
reduction in speed and density with distance from the driving source. We find
increased K-band extinctions in the bright regions as high as 2.9 magnitudes
and suggest that the bow shocks become visible where the outflow impacts on
dense clumps of cloud material. We propose that the outflow is carved out by
episodes of pulsating jets. The jets, driven by central explosive events, are
responsible for excavating a central tunnel through which radiation temporarily
penetrates.

X-ray detection of the active nucleus of this object that is uncontaminated by
nearby sources in the field. We find the nuclear X-ray source to be unresolved
and confirm the rapid, large-amplitude variability reported in previous
studies. The light curve appears to show ~ 11 cycles of a quasi-periodic
oscillation with a period of ~ 400 s. If associated with an orbital feature
near the innermost stable orbit of the accretion disk, this period would
constrain the black-hole mass to be M < 9e5 M_sun. The X-ray spectrum indicates
absorption by an ionized medium, and the spectral shape appears to vary over
the course of our observation. Contrary to prior reports, however, the spectral
variations are uncorrelated with changes in the hard X-ray flux. It is possible
that the short-term spectral variability we observe results from column density
fluctuations in the ionized absorber. A power-law fit to the spectrum above 1
keV yields a photon index of Gamma ~ 0.6, much flatter than that typically
observed in the spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies. We have ruled out photon pile-up
as the cause of the flat spectrum. Even when complex spectral features are
considered, the photon index is constrained to be Gamma < 1.25 (90%
confidence). Comparing our results with previous determinations of the photon
index (Gamma = 1.46 and 1.72), we conclude that the slope of the primary
continuum varies significantly on time scales of a year or less. The extreme
flatness and dramatic long-term variability of the X-ray spectrum are
unprecedented among active galactic nuclei.

significantly from the FLRW result. The deceleration parameter $q_0$ can be
interpreted as $q_0 > 0$ ($q_0=1/2$ for a flat matter dominated universe) in a
FLRW universe and be $q_0 < 0$ as inferred from the inhomogeneous enhancement
that is embedded in a FLRW universe. A spatial volume averaging of local
regions in the backward light cone has to be performed for the inhomogeneous

negative for a positive energy condition. The CMB temperature fluctuations
across the sky can be unevenly distributed in the northern and southern

to trigger galaxy-wide starbursts is strong, both statistically and in
individual cases of major disk-disk mergers. Star formation rates appear
enhanced by factors of a few to ~10^3 above normal. Detailed studies of nearby
mergers and ULIRGs suggest that the main trigger for starbursts is the rapidly
mounting pressure of the ISM in extended shock regions, rather than high-
velocity, ~50 - 100 km/s cloud-cloud collisions. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that in colliding galaxies the star formation rate depends not only
on the gas density, but crucially also on energy dissipation in shocks. An
often overlooked characteristic of merger-induced starbursts is that the
spatial distribution of the enhanced star formation extends over large scales
(~10 - 20 kpc). Thus, although most such starbursts do peak near the galactic
centers, young stellar populations pervade merger remnants and explain why (1)
age gradients in descendent galaxies are mild and (2) resultant cluster systems
are far-flung. This review presents an overview of interesting phenomena
observed in galaxy-wide starbursts and emphasizes that such events continue to
accompany the birth of elliptical galaxies to the present epoch.

This phenomenological model implies that stationary data will have a lognormal

further demonstrate that our model predicts the existence of the powerful
millisecond flares observed in Cyg X-1 in the low/hard state, and explains the
general shape and amplitude of the bicoherence spectrum in that source. Our
model predicts that the most variable light curves will show the most extreme
non-linearity. This result can naturally explain the apparent non-linear
variability observed in some highly variable Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
galaxies, as well as the low states observed on long time-scales in the NLS1

variability process that is observed in XRBs and less variable AGN. That
variability process must be multiplicative (with variations coupled together on
all time-scales) and cannot be additive (such as shot-noise), or related to
self-organised criticality, or result from completely independent variations in
many separate emitting regions. Successful models for variability must
reproduce the observed rms-flux relation and non-linear behaviour, which are
more fundamental characteristics of the variability process than the power
spectrum or spectral-timing properties. Models where X-ray variability is
driven by accretion rate variations produced at different radii remain the most
promising.

that in these objects the conversion from Poynting-flux-dominated to
matter-dominated jets is very likely to take place closer to the black hole
than the region where most of the Doppler boosted radiation observed in blazars
is produced. We briefly discuss the possibility that blazar activity can be

reconnection, where acceleration of relativistic particles and production of
non-thermal flares is taking place.

which is directly measurable. Only in millisecond pulsars the spin-down power

This profile has a soft core and matches quite well with the mass profiles of
dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies deduced from their observed rotation

derive the scaling relations and the critical exponents at the two-loop level

framework is illustrated for the $N$-vector $\phi^{4}$ model describing a
$d$-dimensional system. The anisotropic behaviors are derived in terms of many
independent renormalization group transformations, each one characterized by
independent correlation lengths. The isotropic behaviors can be understood
using only one renormalization group transformation. Feynman diagrams are
solved for the anisotropic behaviors using a new dimensional regularization
associated to a generalized orthogonal approximation. The isotropic diagrams
are treated using this approximation as well as with a new exact technique to
compute the integrals. The entire procedure leads to the analytical solution of
generic loop order integrals with arbitrary external momenta. The property of
universality class reduction is also satisfied when the competing interactions
are turned off. We show how the results presented here reduce to the usual
$m$-fold Lifshitz critical behaviors for both isotropic and anisotropic

occurs at 7 K when field cooled, while as for the ZFC process the magnetization

corrections quadratic in the Ricci scalar and show one can evade both
fine-tuning and the need for a bulk cosmological constant. An analysis of

acceleration driven by bulk particles colliding with the 3d domain wall. The
expansion of our universe is mainly related to these bulk particles. Since our
universe tends to be permeated by a large number of isolated structures, as
temperature diminishes with the expansion, we model our universe with a 3d
domain wall with increasing internal structures. These structures could be
unstable 2d domain walls evolving to fermi-balls which are candidates to cold
dark matter. The momentum transfer of bulk particles colliding with the 3d
domain wall is related to the reflection coefficient. We show a nontrivial
dependence of the reflection coefficient with the number of internal dark
matter structures inside the 3d domain wall. As the population of such
structures increases the velocity of the domain wall expansion also increases.
The expansion is exponential at early times and polynomial at late times. We
connect this picture with string/M-theory by considering BPS 3d domain walls
with structures which can appear through the bosonic sector of a
five-dimensional supergravity theory.

affine space. A complex rank one local system on the arrangement complement is
determined by a set of complex weights for the hyperplanes. We study the
Gauss-Manin connection for the moduli space of arrangements of fixed
combinatorial type in the cohomology of the complement with coefficients in the
local system determined by the weights. For nonresonant weights, we solve the
eigenvalue problem for the endomorphisms arising in the 1-form associated to
the Gauss-Manin connection.

the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, for electrons at
mid-rapidity (|eta| < 0.35) has been measured with the PHENIX detector in Au+Au
collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The measurement was made with respect to
the reaction plane defined at high rapidities (|eta| = 3.1 -- 3.9). From the
result we have measured the v_2 of electrons from heavy flavor decay after
subtraction of the v_2 of electrons from other sources such as photon
conversions and Dalitz decay from light neutral mesons. We observe a non-zero
single electron v_2 with a 90% confidence level in the intermediate p_T region.

properties of nucleon scattering from 12C and of the sub-threshold compound
nuclear states, accounting for properties in the compound nuclei to ~10 MeV.
All compound and quasi-compound resonances observed in total cross-section data
are matched, and on seeking solutions of the method at negative energies, all
sub-threshold states in 13C and 13N are predicted with the correct
spin-parities and with reasonable values for their energies. A collective-model
prescription has been used to define the initiating nucleon-12C interactions
and via use of orthogonalizing pseudo-potentials, account is made of the Pauli
principle. Information is extracted on the underlying structure of each state
in the compound systems by investigating the zero-deformation limit of the
results.

longitudinal phase shifts of laser beams are studied. It is shown theoretically
that a standing wave setup and real-time beam forming techniques (e.g. by
computer-addressed holograms) should make it possible to implement smooth
transport across and along the beams employed in optical trapping schemes.
Novel modes for the efficient collection, transport, and concentration of
trapped particles should thus become realizable in optical trapping setups.

treated as a reduction of the Pauli equation to the (0+1)-dimensional case.
Two-level systems can be described by an SE with a particular form of the
external field. In this article, we also consider associated equations that are
equivalent or (in one way or another) related to the SE. We describe the
general solution of the SE and solve the inverse problem for this equation. We
construct the evolution operator for the SE and consider methods of generating
new sets of exact solutions. Finally, we find a new set of exact solutions of
the SE.

two complementary observables via some measurement M.
  This raises three natural questions: (i) What is the best possible estimate
of A from M ? ; (ii) How 'noisy' is such an estimate ? ; and (iii) Are there
any universally valid uncertainty relations for joint estimates ? Quite general
answers, and applications to heterodyne detection and EPR joint measurements,
