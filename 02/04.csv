Its thermal spectrum and temperature suggest that the flare resulted from an
energy release of about $10^{47}$ erg/sec close to the surface of a neutron
star in the form of radiation and/or pairs. This plasma expanded under its own
pressure producing a fireball and the observed gamma-rays escaped once the
fireball became optically thin. The giant flare was followed by a bright radio
afterglow, with an observable extended size, implying an energetic relativistic
outflow. We revisit here the evolution of relativistic fireballs and we
calculate the Lorentz factor and energy remaining in relativistic outflow once
the radiation escapes. We show that pairs that arise naturally in a pure
pairs-radiation fireball do not carry enough energy to account for the observed
afterglow. We consider various alternatives and we show that if the
relativistic outflow that causes the afterglow is related directly to the
prompt flare, then the initial fireball must be loaded by baryons or Poynting
flux. While we focus on parameters applicable to the giant flare and the radio
afterglow of SGR 1806$-$20 the calculations presented here might be also
applicable to GRBs.

systematic effects, like the ones associated with atmospheric extinction,
detector efficiency, or PSF changes over the detector. The algorithm works
without any prior knowledge of the effects, as long as they linearly appear in
many stars of the sample. The approach, which was originally developed to
remove atmospheric extinction effects, is based on a lower rank approximation
of matrices, an approach which was already suggested and used in chemometrics,
for example. The proposed algorithm is specially useful in cases where the
uncertainties of the measurements are unequal. For equal uncertainties the
algorithm reduces to the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) algorithm. We
present a simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm

Beltran et al. (2004). The CH3CN (12-11) emission of the toroids in G31.41+0.31
and core A1 in G24.78+0.08 has been modeled assuming that it arises from a
disk-like structure seen edge-on, with a radial velocity field. For G31.41+0.31
the model properly fits the data for a velocity v_rot~1.7 km/s at the outer
radius R_out~13400 AU and an inner radius R_inn~1340 AU, while for core A1 in
G24.78+0.08 the best fit is obtained for v_rot~2.0 km/s at R_out~7700 AU and
R_inn~2300 AU. Unlike the rotating disks detected around less luminous stars,
these toroids are not undergoing Keplerian rotation. From the modeling itself,
however, it is not possible to distinguish between constant rotation or
constant angular velocity, since both velocity fields suitably fit the data.
The best fit models have been computed adopting a temperature gradient of the
type T proportional R^{-3/4}, with a temperature at the outer radius T_out~100
K for both cores. The M_dyn needed for equilibrium derived from the models is
much smaller than the mass of the cores, suggesting that such toroids are
unstable and undergoing gravitational collapse. The collapse is also supported
by the CH3^{13}CN or CH3CN line width measured in the cores, which increases
toward the center of the toroids. The estimates of v_inf and \dot M_acc are ~2
km/s and 3x10^{-2} M_sun/yr for G31.41+0.31, and ~1.2 km/s and ~9x10^{-3}

of stellar winds and radiation pressure and allow further accretion on the

decline of the 1993 May outburst. The eclipse maps of the first run show
evidence of one spiral arm, suggesting that spiral structures may still be
present in the accretion disc 9 days after the onset of the outburst. In the
spatially resolved spectra the most prominent lines appear in emission at any
radius, being stronger in the inner disc regions. The spectrum of the gas
stream is clearly distinct from the disc spectrum in the intermediate and outer
disc regions, suggesting the occurrence of gas stream overflow. The full width
half maximum of C IV is approximately constant with radius, in contrast to the
expected $v\propto{R^{-1/2}}$ law for a gas in Keplerian orbits. This line
probably originates in a vertically extended region (chromosphere + disc wind).
The uneclipsed component contributes $\sim{4}$ % of the flux in C IV in the
first run, and becomes negligible in the remaining runs. We fit stellar
atmosphere models to the spatially resolved spectra. The radial run of the disc
color temperature for the three runs is flatter than the expected
$T\propto{R^{-3/4}}$ law for steady-state optically thick discs models, with
$T\simeq{20000}$ K in the inner regions and $T\simeq{9000}$ K in the outer disc
regions. The solid angles that result from the fits are smaller than expected

that the disc is flared in outburst, and decreases in thickness toward the end

are presented. For the years 2003 and 2004, 926 hours of photometry at the
millimag precision level were obtained. The combinations with earlier campaigns
lead to excellent frequency resolution and high signal/noise. A multifrequency
analysis yields 79 frequencies. This represents a new record for this type of
star. The modes discovered earlier were confirmed. Pulsation occurs over a wide
frequency band from 5.7 to 44.3 c/d with amplitudes of 0.2 mmag or larger.
Within this wide band the frequencies are not distributed at random, but tend
to cluster in groups. A similar feature is seen in the power spectrum of the
residuals after 79 frequencies are prewhitened. This indicates that many
additional modes are excited. The interpretation is supported by a histogram of
the photometric amplitudes, which shows an increase of modes with small
amplitudes. The old question of the 'missing modes' may be answered now: the
large number of detected frequencies as well as the large number of additional

theoretical prediction of a large number of excited modes. FG Vir shows a
number of frequency combinations of the dominant mode at 12.7162 c/d (m = 0)

hot (Teff >~ 85 kK) central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN), which has been

973. Using stellar atmospheres models, we reproduce this feature seen in the
spectra of two [WR]-PG 1159 type CSPN, Abell 78 and NGC 2371, and in one PG
1159 CSPN, K 1-16. In the latter case, our analysis suggests an enhanced neon
abundance. Strong neon features in CSPN spectra are important because an
overabundance of this element is indicative of processed material that has been
dredged up to the surface from the inter-shell region in the ``born-again''
scenario, an explanation of hydrogen-deficient CSPN. Our modeling indicates the
NeVII lambda 973 wind feature may be used to discern enhanced neon abundances
for stars showing an unsaturated P-Cygni profile, such as some PG 1159 stars.
We explore the potential of this strong feature as a wind diagnostic in stellar
atmospheres analyses for evolved objects. For the [WR]-PG 1159 objects, the
line is present as a P-Cygni line for Teff >~ 85 kK, and becomes strong for 100
<~ Teff <~ 155 kK when the neon abundance is solar, and can be significantly
strong beyond this range for higher neon abundances. When unsaturated, i.e.,
for very high Teff and/or very low mass-loss rates, it is sensitive to Mdot and
very sensitive to the neon abundance. The NeVII classification is consistent
with recent identification of this line seen in absorption in many PG 1159

Fanaroff & Riley Type I or I/II radio jets. We focus on the comparison of the
dust distributions in the active and quiescent galaxy samples and the relation
between the radio jet and dust orientations. Our main observational conclusions
are: (a) radio galaxies contain a higher fraction of regular dust 'ellipses'
compared to quiescent galaxies which contain more often irregular dust
distributions; (b) the morphology, size and orientation of dust ellipses and
lanes in quiescent early-types and active early-types with kpc-scale radio jets
is very similar; (c) dust ellipses are aligned with the major axis of the
galaxy, dust lanes do not show a preferred alignment except for large (>kpc)
dust lanes which are aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy. Dust
morphologies can be classified as regular 'ellipses' and filamentary 'lanes'.
We show that the dust ellipses are consistent with being nearly circular thin
disks viewed at random viewing angles. The lanes are likely warped dust
structures, which may be in the process of settling down to become regular
disks or are being perturbed by a non-gravitational force. We use the observed
dust-jet orientations to constrain the three-dimensional angle $\theta_{\rm
DJ}$ between jet and dust. For dust-lane galaxies, the jet is approximately
perpendicular to the dust structure, while for dust-ellipse galaxies there is a
much wider distribution of $\theta_{\rm DJ}$. We discuss two scenarios that
could explain the dust/jet/galaxy orientation dichotomy. (abridged)

measure the Geminga's UV spectrum and pulsations. The slope of the far-UV (FUV)
spectrum is close to that of a Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum, suggesting that the FUV
radiation is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star (NS) surface.
The measured FUV flux, F_FUV=(3.7+/-0.2)x10^-15 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 in 1155-1702 A
band, corresponds to a brightness temperature T_RJ=(0.3-0.4)(d_200/R_13)^2 MK.
The soft thermal component of the Geminga's X-ray spectrum measured with the
XMM-Newton observatory corresponds to a temperature T_s=0.49+/-0.01 MK and
radius R_s = (12.9+/-1.0)d_200 km. Unlike other NSs detected in the UV-optical,
the FUV spectrum of Geminga lies below the extrapolation of the soft thermal
component, which might be associated with the Geminga's very low temperature.
Surprisingly, the thermal FUV radiation is strongly pulsed, showing a narrow
dip at a phase close to that of a broader minimum of the soft X-ray light
curve. The strong pulsations might be attributed to partial occultations of the
thermal UV radiation by regions of the magnetosphere filled with
electron/positron plasma. In contrast with the FUV spectrum, the near-IR (NIR)
through near-UV (NUV) spectrum of Geminga is clearly nonthermal. It can be
described by a power-law model, F_nu \propto nu^{-alpha} with a slope alpha =
0.43+/-0.15, close to alpha = 0.56+/-0.24 of the hard X-ray (E>2.5 keV)
magnetospheric component. The observed NIR-optical-NUV spectrum is marginally
consistent with the extrapolation of the X-ray magnetospheric spectrum. The NUV
pulsations, however, do not show a clear correlation with the hard X-ray

inferred from the CO absorption data. We discuss three possibilities for the
apparent paucity of dust along the line of sight through the flared disk: 1)
the dust extinction has been underestimated due to differences in circumstellar
grain properties, such as grain agglomeration; 2) the effect of scattering has
been underestimated and the actual extinction is much higher; or (3) the line
of sight through the disk is probing a gas-rich, dust-depleted region, possibly
due to the stratification of gas and dust in a pre-planetary disk.

circulation between stars and the interstellar gas, and, in particular the
energy input by random and clustered supernova explosions, which determine the
dynamical and chemical evolution of the ISM, and hence of the galaxy as a
whole. In this paper we review the conditions for a self-consistent modelling
of the ISM and present the results from the latest developments in the 3D
HD/MHD global models of the ISM. Special emphasis is put on the effects of the
magnetic field with respect to the volume and mass fractions of the different

and whether the field can prevent matter transport from the disk into the halo.

Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup, and to
allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a constant
energy input rate.

to calibrate the data. The Si array, while better behaved than the Ge arrays,
does show a handful of artifacts that also must be removed to calibrate the
data. The data reduction to remove these effects is divided into three parts.
The first part converts the non-destructively read data ramps into slopes while
removing artifacts with time constants of the order of the exposure time. The
second part calibrates the slope measurements while removing artifacts with
time constants longer than the exposure time. The third part uses the

iteratively. For each of these steps, we illustrate the relevant laboratory

  pages, 3 figures","Astrophys.J. 622 (2005) L13-L16","10.1086/429376",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent studies have shown that K-luminous galaxies at 2<z<2.5 have high
Halpha line widths and high [NII]/Halpha ratios. If these lines arise from
photo-ionization by massive stars in HII regions these results imply that
massive, metal rich galaxies exist at high redshift. Here we investigate the
ionization mechanism in a galaxy with Ks=19.1 and z=2.225 in the Chandra Deep
Field South, using the new Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). GNIRS'
cross-dispersed mode gives simultaneous access to the entire 1-2.5 micron
wavelength range, allowing accurate measurements of line ratios of distant
galaxies. From the ratio of Halpha/Hbeta we infer that the line emitting gas is
heavily obscured, with E(B-V)=0.8. The reddening is higher than that inferred
previously from the UV-optical continuum emission, consistent with findings for
nearby star burst galaxies. We find that the galaxy has Seyfert-like line
ratios, [NII]/Halpha ~ 0.6 and [OIII]/Hbeta ~ 6, which can be caused by
photo-ionization by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or shock ionization due to
a strong galactic wind. Although we cannot exclude the presence of an AGN, the
lack of AGN spectral features in the rest-frame ultraviolet, the consistency of
radio, X-ray, and rest-frame UV star formation indicators, the fact that the
[OIII]/Hbeta ratio remains high out to ~10 kpc from the nucleus, and the
observed gas kinematics all argue for the wind hypothesis. Similar
shock-induced ionization is seen in nearby star burst galaxies with strong

and H-alpha emission line maps and velocity structure with high resolution HST
ACS and NICMOS imaging to probe the complex dynamics of this vigorous
star-burst galaxy. The imaging data shows a complex morphology, consisting of
at least three components separated by ~1'' (8kpc) in projection. When combined
with the H-alpha velocity field from UKIRT UIST IFU observations we identify
two components whose redshifts are coincident with the systemic redshift,
measured from previous CO observations, one of which shows signs of AGN
activity. A third component is offset by 220+/-50km/s from the systemic
velocity. The total star formation rate of the whole system (estimated from the
narrow-line H-alpha and uncorrected for reddening) is 340+/-50Mo/yr. The
Ly-alpha emission mapped by the GMOS IFU covers the complete galaxy and is
offset by +270+/-40km/s from the systemic velocity. This velocity offset is
comparable to that seen in rest-frame UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts
and usually interpreted as a star-burst driven wind. The extended structure of
the Ly-alpha emission suggests that this wind is not a nuclear phenomenon, but
is instead a galactic scale outflow. Our observations suggest that the vigorous
activity in N2 850.4 is arising as a result of an interaction between at least
two dynamically-distinct components, resulting in a strong starburst, a
starburst-driven wind and actively-fuelled AGN activity. [abridged]

designing an optimal photometric system for a wide range of objects is complex,
because it must trade off conflicting scientific requirements. I present a new
method for designing photometric systems and apply it to the Gaia Galactic
survey satellite, which will observe one billion stars brighter than V=20. The
principle is to optimally sample stellar spectra in order to best determine the
APs (e.g. Teff, [Fe/H], interstellar extinction). By considering a filter
system as a set of free parameters (central wavelengths, FWHM etc.), it may be
designed by optimizing a figure-of-merit (FoM) with respect to these
parameters. The FoM is a measure of how well the filter system can vectorially
'separate' stars in the data space to avoid AP degeneracies. The resulting
systems show some interesting features, in particular broad, overlapping
filters, which may be desirable from a multivariate classification perspective.
These systems are competitive with others proposed for Gaia.

000 AU) dark band in the near-infrared that often resembles a massive edge-on
disk. The disk shadows are divided into two basic types, depending on the
distribution of the reflecting material and the resulting morphology of the
shadows in the near-infrared. Two YSOs associated with bipolar nebulosity, CK
3/EC 82 illuminating the Serpens Reflection Nebula (SRN) and Ced 110 IRS 4 in
the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud, are modelled in detail as disk shadows.
Spectral energy distributions of the two sources are collected using both
archival ISO data and new Spitzer-IRS data. An axisymmetric model consisting of
a small disk and a spherically symmetric envelope can reproduce the
near-infrared images and full spectral energy distributions of the two disk
shadow candidates. It is shown that the model fits can be used to constrain the
geometry of the central disks due to the magnifying effect of the projection.
We find that a disk unresolved in near-infrared images, but casting a large
disk shadow, can be modelled at a level of sophistication approaching that of
an edge-on disk with resolved near-infrared images. It is found that the most
obvious observable difference between a disk shadow and a large optically thick
disk is that the disk shadows have a compact near-infrared source near the
center of the dark band. High resolution imaging and/or polarimetry should
reveal the compact source in the center of a disk shadow as an edge-on disk.

recycling of matter from the clouds to the ISM and vice-versa. In the present
work, we have focused our attention on the global effects of the interactions
between clouds and SN shock waves in the ISM of SB environments, and performed
3-D radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive YGUAZU grid
code. We have also considered the effects of the photo-evaporation due to the
presence of a high number of UV photons from hot stars and supernovae (SNe).
The results have shown that, in the presence of radiative cooling, instead of
an efficient gas mixing with the diffuse ISM, the interactions cause the
fragmentation of the clouds into smaller ones. The results have also revealed
that the SNR-clouds interactions are less efficient at producing substantial
mass loss from the clouds to the diffuse ISM than mechanisms such as the
photo-evaporation caused by the UV flux from the hot stars.

Primitive Model (LRPM) of electrolytes with different discretization parameters

number of lattice sites that can be occupied by each particle, and it allows to
study the transition from the discrete picture to the continuum-space

lattice Debye-H\""{u}ckel approach, which takes into account the formation of
dipoles, the dipole-ion interactions and correct lattice Coulomb potentials.
The gas-liquid phase separation is found at low densities of charged particles
for different types of lattices. The increase in the discretization parameter
lowers the critical temperature and the critical density, in agreement with
Monte Carlo computer simulations results. In the limit of infinitely large
discretization our results approach the predictions from the continuum model of
electrolytes. However, for the very fine discretization, where each particle

separation process in the wake of a diffusive reaction front. The dynamics is
described by a Cahn-Hilliard equation with a moving source term representing
the reaction zone, and the electric field enters through its effects on the
properties of the reaction zone. We employ our previous results [I. Bena, F.
Coppex, M. Droz, and Z. R\'acz, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 122}, 024512 (2005)] on how
the electric field changes both the motion of the front, as well as the amount
of reaction product left behind the front, and our main conclusion is that the
number of precipitation bands becomes finite in a finite electric field. The
reason for the finiteness in case when the electric field drives the reagents
towards the reaction zone is that the width of consecutive bands increases so
that, beyond a distance $\ell_+$, the precipitation is continuous (plug is
formed). In case of an electric field of opposite polarity, the bands emerge in
a finite interval $\ell_-$, since the reaction product decreases with time and
the conditions for phase separation cease to exist. We give estimates of
$\ell_{\pm}$ in terms of measurable quantities and thus present an
experimentally verifiable prediction of the ""Cahn-Hilliard equation with a

extending down to low temperature is found for wires with diameters of 20 and

that an initial fitness advantage, although is very quickly balanced, leads to
better spatial arrangement and enhances survival probabilities of the species.
In most cases the system will arrive at a final state where both languages
coexist. However, in cases where one species greatly outnumbers the other in

transport in binary isotopically disordered (BID) Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU-beta)
chains. Using a continuum analog for the corresponding harmonic portion of the
Hamiltonian, the time-independent wave amplitude is calculated for a plane wave
having wavelength \lambda that is incident upon the disordered section, and the
solution is mapped onto the discrete chain. Due to Anderson localization,
energy is initially localized near the incident end of the chain, and in the
absence of anharmonicity the wave amplitude is stationary in time. For
sufficient anharmonicity, however, mode transitions lead to dissipation. Energy
transport along the chain is quantified using both the second moment M of the
site energy, and the number of masses contributing to transport, which was
estimated from the localization parameter. Over the time scales studied, M
increased linearly in time, yielding an effective transport coefficient G. At
low and intermediate impurity concentration, G(c) can be characterized by a
competition between the rate of mode transitions and the time for energy to
propagate a distance equal to the localization length \xi. At the highest
concentrations (1.6 \le c\lambda \le 16.0), there is significant mode
transition suppression in BID systems, and the transport coefficient G(c)
becomes proportional to \xi(c).

system. Multiple users decide how to distribute their budget (bids) among
multiple machines according to their individual preferences to maximize their
individual utility. We look at both the efficiency and the fairness of the
allocation at the equilibrium, where fairness is evaluated through the measures
of utility uniformity and envy-freeness. We show analytically and through
simulations that despite being highly decentralized, such a system converges
quickly to an equilibrium and unlike the social optimum that achieves high
efficiency but poor fairness, the proposed allocation scheme achieves a nice
balance of high degrees of efficiency and fairness at the equilibrium.

Goldberg, Deb, and Clark (1992), it considers building block decision making as
a key facet. The analysis yields a GP-unique relationship because it has to
account for bloat and for the fact that GP solutions often use subsolution
multiple times. The population-sizing relationship depends upon tree size,
solution complexity, problem difficulty and building block expression
probability. The relationship is used to analyze and empirically investigate
population sizing for three model GP problems named ORDER, ON-OFF and LOUD.
These problems exhibit bloat to differing extents and differ in whether their
solutions require the use of a building block multiple times.

sub-structural niching method is compared to restricted tournament selection
(RTS)--a niching method used in hierarchical Bayesian optimization

multiple global optima over large number of generations and does so with
significantly less population than RTS. Additionally, the market share of each

taking as an example the radio interface part of a GSM base station. We also
present the verification procedures for the three safety properties of the

that the spacetime singularity formed by this high-speed dust collapse is very

Sitter space, and so we compare them to the corresponding 4D General Relativity
solution and to the case when gravity resides only in the 5D bulk, and there
are no brane-localized graviton kinetic terms. We write down the solutions in
terms of two-variable hypergeometric functions and find that at short distances
the shock wave profiles look exactly the same as in 4D Minkowski space, thus
recovering the limit one expects if gravity is to be mediated by a metastable,
but long-lived, bulk resonance. The corrections far from the source differ from
the long distance corrections in 4D de Sitter space, coming in with odd powers
of the distance. We discuss in detail the limiting case on the self-inflating
branch when gravity is modified exactly at de Sitter radius, and energy can be
lost into the bulk by resonance-like processes. Finally, we consider Planckian
scattering on the brane, and find that for a sufficiently small impact
parameter it is approximated very closely by the usual 4D description.

open electronic systems, and develop subsequently an exact time-dependent
density-functional theory (TDDFT) formulation for the dynamic response. The
TDDFT formulation depends in principle only on the electron density of the
reduced system. Based on the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, it is
expressed in the form of the equation of motion for the reduced single-electron
density matrix, and this provides thus an efficient numerical approach to
calculate the dynamic properties of open electronic systems. In the
steady-state limit, the conventional first-principles nonequilibrium Green's
function formulation for the current is recovered.

properties of the Mg doped helium clusters MgHe$_n$ with $n=2-50$. Three high
level (MP4, CCSD(T) and CCSDT) MgHe interaction potentials have been used to
study the sensitivity of the dopant location on the shape of the pair
interaction. Despite the similar MgHe well depth, the pair distribution
functions obtained in the diffusion Monte Carlo simulations markedly differ for
the three pair potentials, therefore indicating different solubility properties
for Mg in He$_n$. Moreover, we found interesting size effects for the behavior
of the Mg impurity.
  As a sensitive probe of the solvation properties, the Mg excitation spectra
have been simulated for various cluster sizes and compared with the available
experimental results. The interaction between the excited $^1$P Mg atom and the
He moiety has been approximated using the Diatomics-in-Molecules method and the
two excited $^1\Pi$ and $^1\Sigma$ MgHe potentials. The shape of the simulated
MgHe$_{50}$ spectra show a substantial dependency on the location of the Mg
impurity, and hence on the MgHe pair interaction employed.
  To unravel the dependency of the solvation behavior on the shape of the
computed potentials, exact Density Functional Theory has been adapted to the
case of doped He$_n$ and various energy distributions have been computed. The
results indicate the shape of the repulsive part of the MgHe potential as an
important cause of the different behaviours.

  Small-World Networks of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons","25 pages, 7 figures; submitted to Neural Computation",,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  Qualitatively, some real networks in the brain could be characterized as
'small worlds', in the sense that the structure of their connections is
intermediate between the extremes of an orderly geometric arrangement and of a
geometry-independent random mesh. Small worlds can be defined more precisely in
terms of their mean path length and clustering coefficient; but is such a
precise description useful to better understand how the type of connectivity
affects memory retrieval?
  We have simulated an autoassociative memory network of integrate-and-fire
units, positioned on a ring, with the network connectivity varied
parametrically between ordered and random. We find that the network retrieves
when the connectivity is close to random, and displays the characteristic
behavior of ordered nets (localized 'bumps' of activity) when the connectivity
is close to ordered. Recent analytical work shows that these two behaviours can
coexist in a network of simple threshold-linear units, leading to localized
retrieval states. We find that they tend to be mutually exclusive behaviours,
however, with our integrate-and-fire units. Moreover, the transition between
the two occurs for values of the connectivity parameter which are not simply
related to the notion of small worlds.

spatial frequencies are superposed. The transmission of the resulting structure
gives rise to spatial beatings which are called moir\'e fringes. In classical
optics, the interest in moir\'e fringes comes from the fact that the spatial
beating given by the frequency difference gives information about details(high
spatial frequency) of a given spatial structure. We show that moir\'e fringes
can also arise in the spatial distribution of the coincidence count rate of
twin photons from the parametric down-conversion, when spatial structures with
different frequencies are placed in the path of each one of the twin beams. In
other words,we demonstrate how moir\'e fringes can arise from quantum images.

Magnus expansion, especially when dealing with higher order terms. We
illustrate the scheme by designing 2nd-order pi-pulses and a 6th-order 8-pulse
refocusing sequence for a chain of qubits with nearest-neighbor couplings. We
also discuss the performance of soft-pulse refocusing sequences in suppressing
