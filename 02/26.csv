distributed in a well-defined ring with a peak at a radius of 1.6pc. The
HCO+/HCN emission ratio is typically ~0.4 but with significant variations. The
HCN emission is well correlated with the H_2 emission at 2.12 microns both in
the main emission lobes of the CND and also in four filaments. Multiple areas
of interaction between the ionized gas and the CND are also seen - the western
arm of the minispiral is spatially and kinematically consistent with being the
ionized inner edge of the CND, and the northern arm may be connected to the CND
northeastern extension. With the enhanced spatial resolution of the HCN map, we
resolve numerous dense molecular gas cores within the CND with characteristic
diameter of 7"" (0.25pc). For 26 of the more isolated cores, we measure sizes,
velocity widths, and integrated fluxes. We estimate three masses for each core:
a virial mass, an optically thick mass, and a lower limit mass assuming
optically thin HCN emission. The virial and optically thick masses are in good
agreement with a typical mass of (2-3)x10^4 M_sun and a total CND gas mass of
10^6 M_sun. The internal densities implied by these core masses are on average
(3-4)x10^7 cm^-3, high enough to be stable against tidal disruption from Sgr A*
and the central stellar concentration. This tidal stability suggests a longer
lifetime for the CND. The higher densities and masses within the cores might
support star formation either in the CND itself or within a core infalling
toward the inner parsec, thus providing a mechanism for the formation of the
young stellar population in the inner arcseconds of the galaxy.

radiation pulse followed by a weaker tail. The tail pulsates with the period of
neutron star rotation of $\sim$5--8 s, to decay finally in a few minutes. The
enormous intensity of the initial pulse proved to be far above the saturation
level of the gamma-ray detectors, with the result that the most valuable data
on the time structure and energy spectrum of the pulse is lost. At the time of
the December 27 outburst, a Russian spacecraft Coronas-F with a $\gamma$-ray

It succeeded, however, in observing a weak reflected signal due to the
$\gamma$-rays Compton scattered by the Moon. This has been the first
observation of a cosmic gamma-ray flare reflected from a celestial body. Here
we report, that the detection of a weakened back-scattered initial pulse
combined with direct observations by the Konus $\gamma$-ray spectrometer on the

the Solar System (50 au), and a further 4 have gas at radii <20 au. R_out is
independent of the stellar spectral type (from K through to B9), but is
correlated with total dust mass. R_out appears to decrease with time: discs
around stars of age 3-7 Myr have a mean radius of ~210 au, whereas discs of age

short-duration events are mostly missed by current microlensing surveys that

predict that an intensive monitoring survey programme such as Angstrom, which

around 30 events per season within ~5 arcminutes of the M31 centre, due to
ordinary low-mass stars and remnants. This yield increases to more than 60
events for brown-dwarf dominated mass functions. The overall number of events
and their average duration are sensitive diagnostics of the bulge mass, in
particular the contribution of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The combination
of an inclined disk, an offset bar-like bulge, and differences in the bulge and
disk luminosity functions results in a four-way asymmetry in the number of

into a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previously
uninvestigated phenomenon. The surface modulations decrease dramatically as the
mode switches, explaining why burst oscillations often disappear before burst
cooling ceases. When we include rotational modifications, we find mode
frequencies and drifts consistent with those observed. The large NS spin
($\approx270-620 {\rm Hz}$) needed to make this match implies that accreting
NSs are spinning at frequencies $\approx4 {\rm Hz}$ above the burst
oscillation. Since the asymptotic frequency is set by the crustal interface
wave, the observed late time frequency drifts are a probe of the composition
and temperature of NS crusts. We compare our model with the observed drifts and
persistent luminosities of X-ray burst sources, and find that NSs with a higher
average accretion rate show smaller drifts, as we predict. Furthermore, the
drift sizes are consistent with crusts composed of iron-like nuclei, as
expected for the ashes of the He-rich bursts that are exhibited by these
objects.

world of non-linear wide-angle optics, imperfect optics, inaccurately pointed
telescopes, and defect-ridden cameras is not always a trivial first step. In
the past few years, this problem has been exacerbated by the rise of digital
imaging, providing vast digital streams of astronomical images and data. In the
modern age of increasing bandwidth, human identifications are many times
impracticably slow. In order to perform an automatic computer-based analysis of
astronomical frames, a quick and accurate identification of astronomical
objects is required. Such identification must follow a rigorous transformation
from topocentric celestial coordinates into image coordinates on a CCD frame.
This paper presents a fuzzy logic based algorithm that estimates needed
coordinate transformations in a practical setting. Using a training set of
reference stars, the algorithm statically builds a fuzzy logic model. At
runtime, the algorithm uses this model to associate stellar objects visible in
the frames to known-catalogued objects, and generates files that contain
photometry information of objects visible in the frame. Use of this algorithm
facilitates real-time monitoring of stars and bright transients, allowing
identifications and alerts to be issued more reliably. The algorithm is being
implemented by the Night Sky Live all-sky monitoring global network and has
shown itself significantly more reliable than the previously used non-fuzzy
logic algorithm.

with T(brightness) >=10^7 K, and sub-parsec jets argue for accreting black
holes in >=50% of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts; there is no evidence
against all LLAGNs being mini-AGNs. The radio luminosity function (RLF) of
Palomar Sample LLAGNs and AGNs extends three orders of magnitude below, and is
continuous with, that of `classical' AGNs. We find marginal evidence for a
low-power turnover in the RLF; nevertheless LLAGNs are responsible for a
significant fraction of present day mass accretion. Adopting the jet model of
Falcke & Biermann, we show that the accretion energy output in LLAGNs is
dominated by the energy in the observed jets rather than the radiated
bolometric luminosity. The Palomar LLAGNs and AGNs follow the same scaling
between jet power and narrow line region (NLR) luminosity as the pc to kpc jets
in powerful radio galaxies. Eddington ratios of <= 10^{-1} - 10^{-5} are
implied in jet models of the radio emission. We find evidence that, in analogy
to Galactic black hole candidates, LINERs are in a `low/hard' state (gas poor
nuclei, low Eddington ratio, ability to launch collimated jets) while
low-luminosity Seyferts are in a `high' state (gas rich nuclei, higher
Eddington ratio, less likely to launch collimated jets). The jets are
energetically more significant than supernovae in the LLAGN host galaxies, and
are potentially able to deposit sufficient energy into the innermost parsecs to
significantly slow the gas supply to the accretion disk.

effect by considering the third-order correlations between galaxies and mass:
galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing. Third-order correlations in the cosmic shear
field have recently been reported in the VIRMOS-DESCART and CTIO surveys. Such
data should also be ideal for measuring galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing. Indeed,
the effects of these higher-order correlations may have already been detected
in recent studies of galaxy-galaxy lensing. In this paper we lay out the basic
relations for third-order cross correlations and their projections and
introduce a new set of scale dependent third-order bias parameters. We define
three new observables: two galaxy-shear-shear correlation functions, $G_{\pm}$,
and a galaxy-galaxy-shear correlation, ${\cal G}$. We relate these to the
various projected cross-bispectra and give practical estimators for their
measurement. We note that the observational signature of these correlators is
simply the excess shear-shear correlation measured about foreground galaxies
(for $G_{\pm}$) and the average tangential shear around foreground galaxy pairs
(for $\cal G$). Finally we derive expressions for the third order aperture mass
statistics in terms of both the cross-bispectra and the real-space correlation

synchrotron spectra in most radio, optical and X-ray studies. We find a narrow
range of inferred low energy electron energy slopes, n(E)=const*E^-2.1 for the
currently small sample of lower luminosity sources classified as FRI (not
classical doubles). This distribution is close to, but apparently inconsistent
with, the test particle limit of n(E)=const*E^-2.0 expected from strong
diffusive shock acceleration in the non-relativistic limit. Relativistic shocks
or those modified by the back-pressure of efficiently accelerated cosmic rays
are two alternatives to produce somewhat steeper spectra. We note for further
study the possiblity of acceleration through shocks, turbulence or shear in the
flaring/brightening regions in FRI jets as they move away from the nucleus.
Jets on pc scales and the collimated jets and hot spots of FRII (classical

mechanisms; they appear to show a much wider range of spectra than for FRI

not reliably detected but may, uncharacteristically, strengthen and increase in
frequency with spectral hardness. The VLFN fits to a power law, which becomes
steeper when the source moves to the harder part of the CD. We conclude that 4U
1624-49 is an atoll source which in our observations is in the upper banana
branch. Combining this with the high (0.5-0.7 L_Edd) luminosity, the long-term
flux stability of the source as seen with the RXTE All-Sky Monitor (ASM), and
with the fact that it is an X-ray dip source, we conclude that 4U 1624-49 is
most likely a GX atoll source such as GX 3+1 and GX 9+9, but seen edge on.

an unexpected magnetic field dependence of the dielectric constant. In
particular, the echo technique experiments have shown that the echo amplitude
depends on the magnetic field. The analysis of these experiments results in the
conclusion that the effect seems to be related to the nuclear degrees of
freedom of tunneling systems. The interactions of a nuclear quadrupole
electrical moment with the crystal field and of a nuclear magnetic moment with
magnetic field transform the two-level tunneling systems inherent in amorphous
dielectrics into many-level tunneling systems. The fact that these features
show up at temperatures $T<100mK$, where the properties of amorphous materials
are governed by the long-range $R^{-3}$ interaction between tunneling systems,
suggests that this interaction is responsible for the magnetic field dependent
relaxation. We have developed a theory of many-body relaxation in an ensemble
of interacting many-level tunneling systems and show that the relaxation rate
is controlled by the magnetic field. The results obtained correlate with the
available experimental data. Our approach strongly supports the idea that the
nuclear quadrupole interaction is just the key for understanding the unusual
behavior of glasses in a magnetic field.

structural order by orientational and translational order metrics. Upon cooling
the liquid into the glassy state, both the orientational order parameter $Q$
and translational order parameter $\tau$ increase. At T=0 K, the glasses fall
on a line in the $Q$-$\tau$ plane or {\it order map}.
  The position of this line depends only on density and coincides with the
location in the order map of the inherent structures (IS) sampled upon cooling.
We evaluate the energy of the IS, $e_{IS}(T)$, and find that both order
parameters for the IS are proportional to $e_{IS}$. We also study the
structural order during the transformation of low-density amorphous ice (LDA)
to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) upon isothermal compression and are able to
identify distinct regions in the order map corresponding to these glasses.
Comparison of the order parameters for LDA and HDA with those obtained upon
isochoric cooling indicates major structural differences between glasses
obtained by cooling and glasses obtained by compression. These structural
differences are only weakly reflected in the pair correlation function. We also
characterize the evolution of structural order upon isobaric annealing, leading
at high pressure to very-high density amorphous ice (VHDA).

its relation to loop quantum gravity and high energy cosmic rays. Although we
follow a pedagogic approach we include an open section on unsolved problems,
presented as exercises for the student. We also review varying constant models:
the Brans-Dicke theory, the Bekenstein varying $\alpha$ model, and several more
radical ideas. We show how they make contact with strange high-redshift data,
and perhaps other cosmological puzzles. We conclude with a few remaining
observational puzzles which have failed to make contact with quantum gravity,

mission. By using a combination of independent time-series of highly accurate
gravitational deflection of light in the immediate proximity to the Sun along
with measurements of the Shapiro time delay on the interplanetary scales (to a
precision respectively better than $10^{-13}$ radians and 1 cm), LATOR will
significantly improve our knowledge of relativistic gravity. The primary
mission objective is to i) measure the key post-Newtonian Eddington parameter
$\gamma$ with accuracy of a part in 10$^9$. $(1-\gamma)$ is a direct measure
for presence of a new interaction in gravitational theory, and, in its search,
LATOR goes a factor 30,000 beyond the present best result, Cassini's 2003 test.
Other mission objectives include: ii) first measurement of gravity's non-linear
effects on light to $\sim$0.01% accuracy; including both the traditional
Eddington $\beta$ parameter and also the spatial metric's 2nd order potential
contribution (never been measured before); iii) direct measurement of the solar
quadrupole moment $J_2$ (currently unavailable) to accuracy of a part in 200 of
its expected size; iv) direct measurement of the ``frame-dragging'' effect on
light by the Sun's rotational gravitomagnetic field to one percent accuracy.
LATOR's primary measurement pushes to unprecedented accuracy the search for
cosmologically relevant scalar-tensor theories of gravity by looking for a
remnant scalar field in today's solar system. The key element of LATOR is a
geometric redundancy provided by the laser ranging and long-baseline optical
interferometry. We discuss the mission and optical designs of this proposed
experiment.

(\phi,\omega,\rho^0,\eta',\eta,\pi^0,f_0)K_S$ from $\sin 2\beta$ determined
from $B\to J/\psi K_S$, we study final-state rescattering effects on their
decay rates and CP violation. Recent observations of large direct CP asymmetry
in modes such as $B^0\to K^+\pi^-,\rho^-\pi^+$ means that final state phases in
2-body B decays may not be small. It is therefore important to examine these
long-distance effects on penguin-dominated decays. Such long-distance effects
on $S_f$ are found to be generally small [i.e. ${\cal O}(1-2%)$] or negligible
except for the $\omega K_S$ and $\rho^0K_S$ modes where $S_f$ is lowered by
around 15% for the former and increased by the same percentage for the latter.
However, final-state rescattering can enhance the $\omega K_S, \phi K_S,
\eta'K_S, \rho^0K_S$ and $\pi^0K_S$ rates significantly and flip the signs of
direct CP asymmetries of the last two modes. Direct CP asymmetries in $\omega
K_S$ and $\rho^0K_S$ channels are predicted to be $\A_{\omega K_S}\approx
-0.13$ and $\A_{\rho^0K_S}\approx 0.47$, respectively. However, direct CP
asymmetry in all the other $b\to s$ penguin dominated modes that we study is
found to be rather small (a few percents), rendering these modes a viable place
to search for the CP-odd phases beyond the standard model.

The mixing parameters are in general related to non-perturbative QCD which are
not calculable at present. We determine them by fitting data from known states
and then generalize the mechanism to $\Theta_b$ to predict its mass and width.
The mixing mechanism can also naturally explain the narrow width for $\Theta^+$

and molecular states have much larger decay widths. We also briefly discuss the
properties of the partner eigenstates of $\Theta^+$ and $\Theta_c$ and the

controlled by a cosine potential. In addition, we couple a constant electric

that the volume of n-dimensional hyperbolic and spherical simplices, as a

convex polytopes. The simplex argument works without change in dimensions
greater than 3 (and for spherical simplices in all dimensions), so the bulk of
this paper is concerned with the three-dimensional argument. The estimates
relating the diameter of a polyhedron to the length of the systole of the polar

that every Frobenius object in a monoidal category M arises from an

which M fully and faithfully embeds. Since a 2D topological quantum field
theory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this result also shows
that every 2D TQFT is obtained from an ambijunction in some 2-category. Our
theorem is proved by extending the theory of adjoint monads to the context of
an arbitrary 2-category and utilizing the free completion under Eilenberg-Moore
objects. We then categorify this theorem by replacing the monoidal category M
with a semistrict monoidal 2-category M, and replacing the 2-category D into
which it embeds by a semistrict 3-category. To state this more powerful result,
we must first define the notion of a `Frobenius pseudomonoid', which
categorifies that of a Frobenius object. We then define the notion of a `pseudo
ambijunction', categorifying that of an ambijunction. In each case, the idea is
that all the usual axioms now hold only up to coherent isomorphism. Finally, we
show that every Frobenius pseudomonoid in a semistrict monoidal 2-category
arises from a pseudo ambijunction in some semistrict 3-category.

theoretic applications of the hypoelliptic calculus on Heisenberg manifolds.
More specifically, in this paper we make use of the Heisenberg calculus of
Beals-Greiner and Taylor to analyze the spectral theory of hypoelliptic
operators on Heisenberg manifolds. The main results of this paper include: (i)
Obtaining complex powers of hypoelliptic operators as holomorphic families of
Psi_{H}DO's, which can be used to define a scale of weighted Sobolev spaces
interpolating the weighted Sobolev spaces of Folland-Stein and providing us
with sharp regularity estimates for hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg
manifolds; (ii) Criterions on the principal symbol of $P$ to invert the heat
operator $P+\partial_{t}$ and to derive the small time heat kernel asymptotics
for $P$; (iii) Weyl asymptotics for hypoelliptic operators which can be
reformulated geometrically for the main geometric operators on CR and contact
manifolds, that is, the Kohn Laplacian, the horizontal sublaplacian and its
conformal powers, as well as the contact Laplacian. For dealing with complex
powers of hypoelliptic operators we cannot make use of the standard approach of
Seeley, so we rely on a new approach based on the pseudodifferential approach
representation of the heat kernel. This is especially suitable for dealing with
positive hypoelliptic operators. We will deal with more general operator in a
forthcoming paper using another new approach.

slip for mesoscopic molecules at the boundaries. The slip function plays the
role of a renormalizing factor which incorporates, with some degree of

discuss the mesoscopic slip properties in terms of slip length, slip velocity,
pressure drop reduction (drag reduction), and mass flow rate in microchannels
as a function of the degree of slippage and of its spatial distribution and
localization, the latter parameter mimicking the degree of roughness of the
ultra-hydrophobic material in real experiments. We also discuss the increment
of the slip length in the transition regime, i.e. at O(1) Knudsen numbers.

dependency of the slip length on the mean channel pressure and local slip
properties (Cottin-Bizonne et al. 2004) and with the experimental dependency of

IHEP Protvino and other major high-energy labs, an interesting question is how
one could improve channeling capabilities by applying modern nanotechnology.
Theoretical research of nanotube channeling was in progress over recent years.
In this work, we assess potential benefits from nanotube channeling for real
accelerator systems. We report simulation studies of channeling in
nanostructured material (carbon SWNT and MWNT) tested for possible serving as a
primary scraper for the collimation systems of hadron colliders. The advantages
of nanostructured material as a potential choice for a primary scraper in a
high-energy accelerator such as LHC or the Tevatron are discussed in comparison
to crystal lattices and amorphous material. We evaluate physical processes
relevant to this application and reveal nanotechnology requirements.

motion, taking the equation $mdv/dt =-\zeta v+X$ as their starting point,

equation the correct expression for $\bar{\Delta^2}$, the mean-squared distance
covered by a Brownian particle, credited de Haas-Lorentz, rather than Langevin,
for finding the stationary limit of $\bar{\Delta^2}$. A glance at Einstein's
1907 paper, titled ``Theoretical remarks on Brownian motion'', should suffice
to convince one that it is not unfair to attribute the {\it conception} of the
above equation, now universally known as the Langevin equation, to Einstein.
Langevin's avowed aim in his 1908 article was to recover, through a route that
was `infinitely more simple', Einstein's 1905 expression for the diffusion
coefficient, but a careful reading of Langevin's paper shows that--depending on
how one interprets his description of the statistical behavior of the random
force $X$ appearing in the above equation--his analysis is at best incomplete,
and at worst a mere tautology. Since textbook accounts are based on the
interpretation that renders the proof fallacious, alternative derivations,
which are adaptations of those given by de Haas-Lorentz and Ornstein, are
presented here. Some neglected aspects of the contents of Ornstein's early
papers on Brownian motion are also brought to light.

  oscillators, Cambridge University Press, Nov. 2008, ISBN 978-0-521-88677-2",,,"physics.ins-det",,"  Time, and equivalently frequency, is the most precisely measured physical
quantity. It is therefore inevitable that virtually all domains of engineering
and physics need reference oscillators. The oscillator noise can be decomposed
into amplitude noise and phase noise. The latter, far more important, affects
timing, for it is related to precision and accuracy of measurements.
  The oscillator, inherently, turns the phase noise of the internal parts into
frequency noise. This is a necessary consequence of the Barkhausen condition,
which states that the loop gain must be of one, with zero phase, for stationary
oscillation. There follows that oscillator phase noise, which is the integral
of the frequency noise, diverges in the long run. This is the Leeson effect.
  The topics covered can be divided into three parts. Chapter 1 addresses
language and general physical mechanisms. Chapter 2 aims at understanding the
inside of commercial oscillators through the analysis of the specifications.
Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the use of the Laplace transform to describe the
oscillator and its phase noise.
  Since spring 2004, I had the opportunity to give some seminars on noise in
oscillators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the IEEE Frequency Control
Symposium, at the FEMTO-ST Laboratory, and at the Universite' Henri Poincare'.
These seminars had the purpose to provide a TUTORIAL, as opposed to a report on
advanced science, addressed to a variety of people including technicians, PhD
students, and senior scientists. This booklet derives from these seminars, and
from numerous discussions with colleagues.

population model, deriving the conditions for the existence of a stable steady
state as a function of fertility coefficients, harvesting mortality and
carrying capacity of the resources. Under the effect of proportional harvest,
we give a sufficient condition for a population to extinguish, and we show that
the magnitude of proportional harvest depends on the resources available to the
population. We show that the harvesting yield can be periodic, quasi-periodic
or chaotic, depending on the dynamics of the harvested population. For
populations with large fertility numbers, small harvesting mortality leads to
abrupt extinction, but larger harvesting mortality leads to controlled
population numbers by avoiding over consumption of resources. Harvesting can be
a strategy in order to stabilise periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations in the
number of individuals of a population.

in each lattice site, and then decay to the motional ground state, creating
particle-hole pairs in the reservoir. Atoms transferred into the ground
motional level are no longer coupled back to the reservoir, and doubly occupied
sites in the motional ground state are prevented by Pauli blocking. This scheme
has strong conceptual connections with optical pumping, and can be extended to
load high-fidelity patterns of atoms.
