caused by spiral density waves. In the solar neighborhood, stellar velocities
corresponding to orbits that are nearly closed in the frame rotating with a
spiral pattern represent likely regions for stellar concentrations. Via
particle integration, we show that orbits can intersect the solar neighborhood
when they are excited by Lindblad resonances with a spiral pattern. We find
that a two-armed spiral density wave with pattern speed placing the Sun near
the 4:1 Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) can cause two families of nearly closed
orbits in the solar neighborhood. One family corresponds to square shaped
orbits aligned so their peaks lie on top of, and support, the two dominant
stellar arms. The second family correspond to orbits 45 degrees out of phase
with the other family. Such a spiral density pattern could account for two
major clumps in the solar neighborhood's velocity distribution. The
Pleiades/Hyades moving group corresponds to the first family of orbits and the
Coma Berenices moving group corresponds to the second family. This model
requires a spiral pattern speed of approximately 0.66 +- 0.03 times the angular
rotation rate of the Sun or 18.1 +- 0.8 km/s/kpc.

and reverse shock components. For a broad range of parameters, a generic
property for GRBs at redshifts $z \sim$ 5--30 is that the emission peaks in the
millimeter to far-infrared bands with milli-Jansky flux levels, first at a few
hours after the burst due to the reverse shock, and then again for several days
afterwards with somewhat lower flux due to the forward shock. The radio,
submillimeter and infrared continuum emission should be readily detectable out
to $z \ga 30$ by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Extended Very Large
Array (EVLA), Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and other facilities. For relatively
bright bursts, spectroscopic measurements of molecular and atomic absorption
lines due to ambient protostellar gas may be possible. Utilizing models of
primordial protostellar clouds, we show that under certain conditions,
appreciable absorption may be caused by HD rotational transitions even in
metal-free environments. After sufficient metal enrichment, absorption from CO
rotational transitions and [OI] fine-structure transitions can also become
strong. With appropriate observing strategies in combination with optical
telescopes, ALMA and/or SKA may be able to detect such lines, offering a unique
probe of physical conditions in individual Pop III and early Pop II star
forming regions. We also remark on potential near-infrared absorption features
due to electronic transitions of H$_2$.

remarkable results of deep impact for fundamental physics: the existence of
non-baryonic dark matter, the (nearly) flatness of space, the domination of the
density of the universe by some gravitationally repulsive fluid. This last
result is probably the most revolutionizing one: the scientific review Sciences
has considered twice results on this question as Breakthrough of the Year (for
1998 and 2003). However, direct evidence of dark energy are still rather weak,
and the strength of the standard scenario relies more on the ""concordance""
argument rather than on the robustness of direct evidences. Furthermore, a
scenario can be build in an Einstein-de Sitter universe, which reproduces as
well as the concordance model the following various data relevant to cosmology:
WMAP results, large scale structure of the universe, local abundance of massive
clusters, weak lensing measurements, most Hubble constant measurements not
based on stellar indicators. Furthermore, recent data on distant x-ray clusters
obtained from XMM and Chandra indicates that the observed abundances of
clusters at high redshift taken at face value favors an Einstein de Sitter
model and are hard to reconcile with the concordance model. It seems wise
therefore to consider that the actual existence of the dark energy is still an
open question.

simulations of jets launched self-consistently from accretion disks orbiting
Kerr black holes and applied the results to the inner engine of the collapsar
model of gamma-ray bursts. The accretion flow launches energetic jets in the
axial funnel region of the disk/jet system, as well as a substantial coronal
wind. The jets feature knot-like structures of extremely hot,
ultra-relativistic gas; the gas in these knots begins at moderate velocities
near the inner engine, and is accelerated to ultra-relativistic velocities
(Lorentz factors of 50, and higher) by the Lorentz force in the axial funnel.
The increase in jet velocity takes place in an acceleration zone extending to
at least a few hundred gravitational radii from the inner engine. The overall
energetics of the jets are strongly spin-dependent, with high-spin black holes
producing the highest energy and mass fluxes. In addition, with high-spin black
holes, the ultra-relativistic outflow is cylindrically collimated within a few
hundred gravitational radii of the black hole, whereas in the zero- spin case
the jet retains a constant opening angle of approximately 16 degrees. The
simulations also show that the coronal wind, though considerably slower and
colder than the jets, also carries a significant amount of mass and energy.
When simulation data is scaled to the physical dimensions of a collapsar the
jets operate for a period ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 seconds, until the accretion
disk is depleted, delivering $10^{48}$ to $10^{49}$ erg.

shows significant boosting during transient merging events, but the integrated
SZE appears to be relatively insensitive to these events. Most importantly, the
integrated SZE closely tracks the underlying cluster mass. Observations through
the thermal SZE allow a strikingly accurate mass estimation from relatively
simple measurements that do not require either parametric modeling or geometric
deprojection and thus avoid assumptions regarding the physics of the ICM or the
symmetry of the cluster. This result offers significant promise for precision
cosmology using clusters of galaxies.

early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6<z<1.15. The galaxies in this

from the ACS. We find that the mean evolution in M/L of our sample is $Delta ln
(M/L_B) = -1.74+/-0.16z$, with a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter. This value can
be too low by 0.3 due to selection effects, resulting in $Delta ln (M/L_B) =
-1.43+/-0.16z$. The strong correlation between M/L and rest-frame color
indicates that the observed scatter is not due to measurement errors, but due
to intrinsic differences between the stellar populations of the galaxies. This
pace of evolution is much faster than the evolution of cluster galaxies.
However, we find that the measured M/L evolution strongly depends on galaxy
mass. For galaxies with masses $M>2 x 10^11 Msol$, we find no significant
difference between the evolution of field and cluster galaxies: $Delta ln
(M/L_B) = -1.20+/-0.18z for field galaxies and $Delta ln (M/L_B) =
-1.12+/-0.06z$ for cluster galaxies. The relation between the measured M/L
evolution and mass is partially due to selection effects. However, even when
taking selection effects into account, we still find a relation between M/L
evolution and mass, which is most likely caused by a lower mean age and a
larger intrinsic scatter for low mass galaxies. Results from lensing early-type
galaxies, which are mass-selected, show a very similar trend with mass. This,
combined with our findings, provides evidence for down-sizing. Previous studies
of the rate of evolution of field early-type galaxies found a large range of
mutually exclusive values. We show that these differences are largely caused by
the differences between fitting methods. (Abridged)

spin parameters of dark matter haloes forming in LCDM N-body simulations. In
particular, we focus on haloes with virial masses characteristic of the hosts

analysis demonstrates that concentration and spin are anti-correlated. If we
assume that a galaxy disk forms in one of these haloes from baryons that
approximately conserved angular momentum during their dissipation into the
rotationally supported disk, then it is possible to estimate the disk's central
surface density. For an appropriate choice of mass-to-light ratio, we can place
constraints on the central surface brightness of the disk and hence identify
the analogues of the host haloes of LSB and HSB galaxies. We find that our LSB
galaxy analogues occupy haloes that have lower concentrations than might be
expected based on consideration of the mass-concentration relation for the LCDM
cosmology. The distribution of concentrations peaks at c~6, in good agreement
with observational data, although there are important differences between the
shapes of the simulated and observationally inferred distributions. This
suggests that LSB galaxies inhabit a biased subsample of the halo population,
and that this bias may be an important ingredient for resolving the current
debate regarding the structure of LSB galaxy dark matter haloes.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.72.011602",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A phase-field model that allows for quantitative simulations of low-speed
eutectic and peritectic solidification under typical experimental conditions is
developed. Its cornerstone is a smooth free-energy functional, designed so that
the stable solutions connecting any two phases are completely free of the third
phase. For the simplest choice of this functional, the equations of motion for
each of the two solid-liquid interfaces can be mapped to the standard
phase-field model of single-phase solidification, and all thin-interface
corrections to the dynamics of the solid-liquid interfaces can be eliminated.
This means that simulation results become independent of the thickness W of the
diffuse interfaces. As a consequence, accurate results can be obtained using
values of W much larger than the physical interface thickness, which makes
simulations for realistic experimental parameters feasible. Convergence of the
simulation outcome with decreasing W is explicitly demonstrated. The results
are also compared to a boundary-integral formulation of the corresponding
free-boundary problem. Excellent agreement is found, except in the immediate
vicinity of bifurcation points, where differences arise. These differences
reveal that, in contrast to the standard assumptions of the free-boundary
problem, out of equilibrium the diffuse trijunction region of the phase-field
model can (i) slightly deviate from Young's law for the contact angles, and
(ii) advance in a direction that forms a finite angle with the solid-solid
interface at each instant. While the deviation (i) extrapolates to zero in the
limit of vanishing interface thickness, the small angle in (ii) remains roughly
constant, which indicates that it might be a genuine physical effect, present
even for an atomic-scale interface thickness.

  a talk delivered at the 5th International LISA Symposium (Noordwijk, July
  2004)",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Captures of compact objects (COs) by massive black holes in galactic nuclei
(aka ``extreme-mass-ratio inspirals'') will be an important source for LISA.
However, a large fraction of captures will not be individually resolvable, and
so will constitute a source of ``confusion noise,'' obscuring other types of
sources. Here we estimate the shape and overall magnitude of the spectrum of
confusion noise from CO captures. The overall magnitude depends on the capture
rates, which are rather uncertain, so we present results for a plausible range
of rates. We show that the impact of capture confusion noise on the total LISA
noise curve ranges from insignificant to modest, depending on these rates.
Capture rates at the high end of estimated ranges would raise LISA's overall
(effective) noise level by at most a factor $\sim 2$. While this would somewhat
decrease LISA's sensitivity to other classes of sources, it would be a pleasant
problem for LISA to have, overall, as it would also imply that detection rates
for CO captures were at nearly their maximum possible levels (given LISA's
baseline design).

theory of point particle fields. Among them is the fate of a massive point
particle. Since its rest mass exists entirely within its Schwarzschild radius,
in the classical solutions of Einstein's theory, the respective system should
be a black hole. We address this issue using exact results in a new approach to
quantum gravity based upon well-tested resummation methods in point particle
quantum field theory. We show that the classical conclusion is obviated by
quantum loop effects. We show that our new approach already passes two
theoretical checks with the published literature; for, it reproduces known
results on the one-loop correction to the graviton self-energy in scaler matter
coupled to Einstein's gravity as analyzed by 't Hooft and Veltman and it is
consistent with the asymptotic safety results of Bonnanno and Reuter on the
behavior of Newton's constant in the deep Euclidean regime. Indeed, our
approach is consistent with the black hole phenomenology of the latter authors,
including their results on the final state of the Hawking radiation for an
originally massive black hole. Further black hole related phenomenological
implications are also discussed.

resulting functional integral is shown, using known methods (hep-th/9309028),

of the Wigner phase space distribution of the fermion theory which satisfies u

a phase space (hence noncommutative) in the half-BPS sector. Our method sheds

compactifications that control chaos in vacuum Einstein gravity, as well as in
string theories with N = 1 supersymmetry and M-theory. In models where chaos is
controlled in this way, the universe can remain homogeneous and flat until it
enters the quantum gravity regime. At this point, the classical equations

allow a smooth approach to the big crunch and transition into a subsequent

stratified algebras, whose Ringel dual is properly stratified, we discover a
new Ringel-type duality for such algebras, which we call the two-step duality.
This duality arises from the existence of a new (generalized) tilting module
for stratified algebras with properly stratified Ringel dual. We show that this
new tilting module has a lot of interesting properties, for instance, its
projective dimension equals the projectively defined finitistic dimension of
the original algebra, it guarantees that the category of modules of finite
projective dimension is contravariantly finite, and, finally, it allows one to
compute the finitistic dimension of the original algebra in terms of the

Zhang-Vi\~nals model (J. Fluid Mech. 1997). The exact impulsive-forcing
results, in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes, are compared with
numerical results for sinusoidal and multifrequency forcing. We find
surprisingly good agreement between impulsive forcing results and those
obtained using a two-term truncated Fourier series representation of the
impulsive forcing function. As noted previously by Bechhoefer and Johnson (Am.
J. Phys. 1996), in the case of two equally-spaced impulses per period there are
only subharmonic modes of instability. The familiar situation of alternating
subharmonic and harmonic resonance tongues emerges for unequally-spaced
impulses. We extend the linear analysis for two impulses per period to the
weakly nonlinear regime for one-dimensional waves. Specifically, we derive an
analytic expression for the cubic Landau coefficient in the bifurcation
equation as a function of the dimensionless fluid parameters and spacing
between the two impulses. As the capillary parameter is varied, one finds a
parameter region of wave amplitude suppression, which is due to a familiar 1:2
spatio-temporal resonance between the subharmonic mode of instability and a
damped harmonic mode. This resonance occurs for impulsive forcing even when
harmonic resonance tongues are absent from the neutral stability curve. The
strength of this resonance feature can be tuned by varying the spacing between
the impulses. This finding is interpreted in terms of a recent symmetry-based
analysis of multifrequency forced Faraday waves by Porter, Topaz and Silber
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 2004, Phys. Rev. E 2004).

being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation x-ray
facilities. Although only five years have elapsed since the technique was first
introduced, it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resolution
threedimensional imaging and promises few-nm resolution with much larger
samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope. Both life-
and materials-science applications of XDM are intended, and it is expected that
the principal limitation to resolution will be radiation damage for life
science and the coherent power of available x-ray sources for material science.
In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage. We use a
statistical analysis based on the so-called ""dose fractionation theorem"" of
Hegerl and Hoppe to calculate the dose needed to make an image of a lifescience
sample by XDM with a given resolution. We conclude that the needed dose scales
with the inverse fourth power of the resolution and present experimental
evidence to support this finding. To determine the maximum tolerable dose we
have assembled a number of data taken from the literature plus some
measurements of our own which cover ranges of resolution that are not well
covered by reports in the literature. The tentative conclusion of this study is
that XDM should be able to image frozen-hydrated protein samples at a
resolution of about 10 nm with ""Rose-criterion"" image quality.

presented for the ``classical'' resonance which occurs in the limit as the
kicking period goes to zero. This resonance is found to be analogous to the
quantum resonances, and a similar one-parameter classical scaling function is
derived, and found to match our experimental results. The width of the quantum
and classical resonance peaks is compared, and their Sub-Fourier nature
examined.

length, number and dispersion. Highly repetitive DNA is particularly rich in
homo-- and di--nucleotide repeats, while middle repetitive DNA is rich of
families of interspersed, mobile elements hundreds of base pairs (bp) long,
among which the Alu families. A link between homo- and di-polymeric tracts and
mobile elements has been recently highlighted. In particular, the mobility of
Alu repeats, which form 10% of the human genome, has been correlated with the
length of poly(A) tracts located at one end of the Alu. These tracts have a
rigid and non-bendable structure and have an inhibitory effect on nucleosomes,
which normally compact the DNA. We performed a statistical analysis of the
genome-wide distribution of lengths and inter--tract separations of poly(X) and
poly(XY) tracts in the human genome. Our study shows that in humans the length
distributions of these sequences reflect the dynamics of their expansion and
DNA replication. By means of general tools from linguistics, we show that the
latter play the role of highly-significant content-bearing terms in the DNA
text. Furthermore, we find that such tracts are positioned in a non-random
fashion, with an apparent periodicity of 150 bases. This allows us to extend
the link between repetitive, highly mobile elements such as Alus and
low-complexity words in human DNA. More precisely, we show that Alus are
sources of poly(X) tracts, which in turn affect in a subtle way the combination
and diversification of gene expression and the fixation of multigene families.

with sufficient control over its parameters, laser light can be used to

distribution (QKD) protocols. It is based on direct information-theoretic
arguments and thus also applies if no equivalent entanglement purification
scheme can be found. Using this technique, we investigate a general class of
QKD protocols with one-way classical post-processing. We show that, in order to
analyze the full security of these protocols, it suffices to consider
collective attacks. Indeed, we give new lower and upper bounds on the
secret-key rate which only involve entropies of two-qubit density operators and
which are thus easy to compute. As an illustration of our results, we analyze
the BB84, the six-state, and the B92 protocol with one-way error correction and
privacy amplification. Surprisingly, the performance of these protocols is
increased if one of the parties adds noise to the measurement data before the
error correction. In particular, this additional noise makes the protocols more
robust against noise in the quantum channel.
