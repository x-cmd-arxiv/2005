remains a puzzle. Recently, Hansen and Milosavljevic (2003, HM) have argued
that an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) could have delivered the young
stars to the immediate vicinity of SgrA*. Here we focus on the final stages of
the HM scenario. Namely, we integrate numerically the orbits of stars which are
initially bound to the IMBH, but are stripped from it by the tidal field of
SgrA*. Our numerical algorithm is a symplectic integrator designed specifically
for the problem at hand; however, we have checked our results with SYMBA, a
version of the widely available SWIFT code. We find that the distribution of
the post-inspiral orbital parameters is sensitive to the eccentricity of the
inspiraling IMBH. If the IMBH is on a circular orbit, then the inclinations of
numerically computed orbits relative to the inspiral plane are almost always
smaller than 10 degrees, and therefore (a) the simulations are in good
agreement with the observed motions of stars in a clockwise-moving stellar
disc, (b) the simulations never reproduce the orbits of stars outside this
disc, which include those in the second thick ring of stars and the randomly
oriented unrelaxed orbits of some of the S-stars. If the IMBH's orbital
eccentricity is e=0.6, then approximately half of the stars end up with orbital
inclinations below 10 degrees, and another half have inclinations anywhere
between 0 and 180 degrees; this is somewhat closer to what's observed. We also
show that if IRS13 cluster is bound by an IMBH, as has been argued by Maillard
et. al. 2004, then the same IMBH could not have delivered all of the young
stars to their present location.

optically invisible radio sources (OIRS). Only four of the thirty-one OIRSs
observed with MIPS are detected at 24 microns. Comparisons of the radio and
infrared properties of the OIRSs with various galaxy spectral energy
distributions demonstrate that most of these sources are powered by AGN rather
than starbursts. Similarly, eleven X-ray sources observed by both MIPS and the
VLA are classified as optically invisible X-ray sources (OIXS). None are
detected at 24 microns or 20 cm. All seven OIXSs detected in Chandra's 0.5-2

being dominated by an unobscured AGN. From these results we conclude that both

relatively unaffected by dust and most likely at z > 1. No OIRSs are detected

remove most ISM from a star-forming spheroid. However, the mechanism
responsible for the deposition of energy into the ISM is still unclear.
Starting from a model for feedback in galaxy formation with a two-phase medium
(Monaco 2004a), we propose that the perturbation induced by radiative heating
from a quasar on the ISM triggers a critical change of feedback regime. In the
feedback model, SNRs expanding in the hot and pressurized phase of a
star-forming spheroid tipically become pressure-confined before the hot
interior gas is able to cool. Whenever the evaporation flow due to radiative
heating of the quasar is significant with respect to the star-formation rate,
the SNRs reach the point where their interior gas cools before being confined,
forming a thick cold shell. We show that in this conditions the shells
percolate into a super-shell of cold gas that sweeps the whole galaxy.
Radiation pressure then pushes the shell out of the galaxy. This self-limiting
mechanism leads to a correlation between black hole and bulge masses. The
insertion of a motivated wind trigger criterion in a hierarchical galaxy
formation model shows however that winds are not necessary to obtain a good
black hole--bulge correlation. In absence of winds, good results are obtained
if the mechanism responsible for the creation of a reservoir of low-angular
momentum gas (able to accrete onto the black hole) deposits mass at a rate
proportional to the star-formation rate. Using a novel galaxy formation model,
we show under which conditions black hole masses are self-limited by the wind
mechanism described above, and outline the possible observational consequences
of this self-limitation. [Abridged]

in clusters of galaxies, we report on an extensive set of 2D MHD simulations of
hot buoyant bubbles evolving in a realistic intracluster medium. Our bubbles
are inflated near the base of the ICM over a finite time interval from a region
whose magnetic field is isolated from the ICM. We confirm both the early
conjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD
bubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising
bubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as
they stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or
their initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play
a significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with
initial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\beta = P_g/P_b$
approaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became
large enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also
depends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of
the field at the bubble/ICM interface. For example, reconnection of
anti-parallel fields across the bubble top greatly reduced the ability of the
magnetic field to inhibit disruptive instabilities. Our results confirm earlier
estimates of $10^8$ yr for relic radio bubble lifetimes and show that magnetic
fields can account for the long term stability of these objects against
disruption by surface instabilities. In addition these calculations show that
lifting and mixing of the ambient ICM may be a critical function of field
geometries in both the ICM and in the bubble interior.

maser is pumped as electrons are accelerated by the parallel electric field
that develops as a result of the mirror. We estimate the maximum brightness
temperatures that can be obtained in a single maser site and in an array of
many masers operating simultaneously, under conditions likely to apply in
blazar jets. Synchrotron absorption, by relativistic electrons within the jet,
presents the largest obstacle to the escape of the maser radiation, and may
render most of it invisible. However, we argue that a high brightness
temperature could be produced in a thin boundary layer outside the synchrotron
photosphere, perhaps in the shear layer along the wall of the jet. Induced
Compton scattering provides additional constraints on the maximum brightness
temperature of a masing jet. We suggest that recent observations of diffractive
scintillation in the blazar J1819+3845, indicating intrinsic brightness
temperatures greater than 10^{14} K at 5 GHz, may be explained in terms of
cyclotron maser emission. High brightness temperature maser emission from
blazar jets may extend to frequencies as high as ~100 GHz, with the maximum
possible T_B scaling roughly as 1/frequency. Less massive relativistic jet
sources, such as microquasars, are even better candidates for producing

permitted emission lines of CaII, OI and HeI are also good accretion
indicators, as in CTTs; (3) the CaII 8662A flux is an excellent quantitative
measure of the accretion rate (Mdot) in VLMS and BDs(as in CTTs); (4) Mdot
diminishes as M^2 -- our measurements support previous findings of this
correlation, and extend it to the entire range of sub-stellar masses; (5) the
accretor fraction among VLMS and BDs decreases substantially with age, as in
higher-mass stars; (6) at any given age, the VLMS and BD accretor fraction is
comparable to that in higher-mass stars; and (7) a number of sources with IR
disk excesses do not evince measurable accretion, with the incidence of such a
mismatch increasing with age: this implies that disks in the low mass regime
can persist beyond the main accretion phase, and parallels the transition from
the classical to post-T Tauri stage in more massive stars. These strong
similarities at young ages, between higher-mass stars and low-mass bodies close

mechanism in the two mass regimes. (abridged)

expansion. This paper illustrates some properties of diffusive acceleration at
relativistic shocks that pertain to GRB models, providing interpretation of the
BATSE/EGRET data. Using a standard Monte Carlo simulation, computations of the
spectral shape, and the range of spectral indices are presented, as functions
of the shock speed, magnetic field obliquity and the type of particle
scattering. It is clear that while quasi-parallel, relativistic shocks with
fields approximately normal to the shock plane can efficiently accelerate
particles, highly oblique and perpendicular ones cannot unless the particle
diffusion is almost isotropic, i.e. extremely close to the Bohm limit.
Accordingly, an array of distribution indices should be present in the burst
population, as is exhibited by the EGRET data, and even mildly-relativistic
internal shocks require strong field turbulence in order to model the >100 MeV

losses of this material. Numerical simulations of this effect often show the
complete disruption of the bubbles followed by the mixing of the bubble
material with the surrounding cluster gas due to fluid instabilities on the
bubble surface. This prediction is inconsistent with the observations of
apparently coherent bubble structures in clusters. We derive a general
description in the linear regime of the growth of instabilities on the surface
between two fluids under the influence of a gravitational field, viscosity,
surface tension provided by a magnetic field and relative motion of the two
fluids with respect to each other. We demonstrate that Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities are always suppressed, if the fluids are viscous. They are also
suppressed in the inviscid case for fluids of very different mass densities. We
show that the effects of shear viscosity as well as a magnetic fields in the
cluster gas can prevent the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities on relevant
scale lengths. R-T instabilities on pc-scales are suppressed even if the
kinematic viscosity of the cluster gas is reduced by two orders of magnitude
compared to the value given by Spitzer for a fully ionised, unmagnetised gas.
Similarly, magnetic fields exceeding a few microG result in an effective
surface tension preventing the disruption of bubbles. For more massive
clusters, instabilities on the bubble surface grow faster. This may explain the
absence of thermal gas in the north-west bubble observed in the Perseus cluster
compared to the apparently more disrupted bubbles in the Virgo cluster.

their collision rate is reduced by a factor $(1+\alpha)/2$ (where $\alpha$ is
the constant coefficient of normal restitution). In this paper we test the
above expectation in a paradigmatic nonequilibrium state, namely the simple or
uniform shear flow, by performing Monte Carlo computer simulations of the
Boltzmann equation for both classes of dissipative gases with a dissipation
range $0.5\leq \alpha\leq 0.95$ and two values of the imposed shear rate $a$.
The distortion of the steady-state velocity distribution from the local
equilibrium state is measured by the shear stress, the normal stress
differences, the cooling rate, the fourth and sixth cumulants, and the shape of
the distribution itself. In particular, the simulation results seem to be
consistent with an exponential overpopulation of the high-velocity tail. The
EHS results are in general hardly distinguishable from the IHS ones if
$\alpha\gtrsim 0.7$, so that the distinct signature of the IHS gas (higher
anisotropy and overpopulation) only manifests itself at relatively high
dissipations

measurements of specific heat, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and
thermal expansivity up to room temperature for the 6 K superconductor ZrB12,
using well-characterized single crystals with a residual resistivity ratio >9.
The specific heat gives the bulk result 2*delta(0)/(k_B*Tc)=3.7 for the
superconducting gap ratio, and excludes multiple gaps and d-wave symmetry for
the Cooper pairs. The Sommerfeld constant gamma_n = 0.34 mJ K-2 gat-1 and the
magnetic susceptibility xsi = -2.1 x 10^-5 indicate a low density of states at
the Fermi level. The Debye temperature theta_D is in the range 1000-1200 K near
zero and room temperature, but decreases by a factor of ~2 at ~35 K. The
specific heat and resistivity curves are inverted to yield approximations of
the phonon density of states F(omega) and the spectral electron-phonon
scattering function alpha_tr^2 F(omega), respectively. Both unveil a 15 meV
mode, attributed to Zr vibrations in oversized B cages, which gives rise to
electron-phonon coupling. The thermal expansivity further shows that this mode
is anharmonic, while the vanishingly small discontinuity at Tc establishes that
the cell volume is nearly optimal with respect to Tc.

Zubarev is employed to analyse and derive generalized transport and kinetic
equations. The degrees of freedom in solids can often be represented as a few
interacting subsystems (electrons, spins, phonons, nuclear spins, etc.).
Perturbation of one subsystem may produce a nonequilibrium state which is then
relaxed to an equilibrium state due to the interaction between particles or
with a thermal bath. The generalized kinetic equations were derived for a
system weakly coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport
and relaxation processes. It was shown that the ""collision term"" had the same
functional form as for the generalized kinetic equations for the system with
small interactions among particles. The applicability of the general formalism
to physically relevant situations is investigated. It is shown that some known
generalized kinetic equations (e.g. kinetic equation for magnons, Peierls
equation for phonons) naturally emerges within the NSO formalism. The
relaxation of a small dynamic subsystem in contact with a thermal bath is
considered on the basis of the derived equations. The Schrodinger-type equation
for the average amplitude describing the energy shift and damping of a particle
in a thermal bath and the coupled kinetic equation describing the dynamic and
statistical aspects of the motion are derived and analysed. The equations
derived can help in the understanding of the origin of irreversible behavior in
quantum phenomena.

into this class. Also proposed are efficient parallel algorithms for simulating
these asynchronous cellular arrays. In the algorithms, one or several cells are
assigned to a processing element (PE), local times for different PEs can be
different. Although the standard serial algorithm by Metropolis, Rosenbluth,
Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller can simulate such arrays, it is usually believed
to be without an efficient parallel counterpart. However, the proposed parallel
algorithms contradict this belief proving to be both efficient and able to
perform the same task as the standard algorithm. The results of experiments
with the new algorithms are encouraging: the speed-up is greater than 16 using
25 PEs on a shared memory MIMD bus computer, and greater than 1900 using 2**14

scenarios and find it to be always substantial and, generically, much higher
than suggested by the rough estimates usually made. This is due to implicit
tunings between parameters that can be overlooked at first glance but show up
in a more systematic analysis. Focusing on four popular and representative
Little Higgs scenarios, we find that the fine-tuning is essentially comparable
to that of the Little Hierarchy problem of the Standard Model (which these
scenarios attempt to solve) and higher than in supersymmetric models. This does
not demonstrate that all Little Higgs models are fine-tuned, but stresses the
need of a careful analysis of this issue in model-building before claiming that
a particular model is not fine-tuned. In this respect we identify the main
sources of potential fine-tuning that should be watched out for, in order to
construct a successful Little Higgs model, which seems to be a non-trivial
goal.

to give the correct signal interpretation. In particular, it was found that the
LHC has potential to discover LQ with a mass up to 1.2 TeV and 1.5 TeV for the

contributes 30-50% to the total signal rate for LQ-l-q coupling, taken equal to

existence of bound states of the J/psi in light nuclei is possible. For the
psi' resonance we estimate even larger elastic scattering cross section and
also a very large cross section of the process psi'+N -> psi+N giving rise to
the decay width of tens of MeV for the psi' resonance in heavy nuclei.

the coupling of the closed string states with the D-branes and the spectrum of

Hanany-Witten setups, using exact CFT analysis. In particular we identify the
open string spectrum on the D-branes stretched between NS5-branes which
confirms the low-energy analysis in brane constructions, and that allows to go
to higher energy scales. As an application we show the emergence of the
beta-function of the N=2 gauge theory on D4-branes stretching between
NS5-branes from the boundary states describing the D4-branes. We also speculate
on the possibility of getting a matrix model description of little string
theory from the effective theory on the D1-branes. By considering D3-branes
orthogonal to the NS5-branes we find a CFT incarnation of the Hanany-Witten
effect of anomalous creation of D-branes. Finally we give an brief description

Reine Angew. Math. 630 (2009), 1--31",,,"math.AG math.AC math.CO",,"  We relate a classic algebro-geometric degeneration technique, dating at least
to [Hodge 1941], to the notion of vertex decompositions of simplicial
complexes. The good case is when the degeneration is reduced, and we call this
a ""geometric vertex decomposition"".
  Our main example in this paper is the family of vexillary matrix Schubert
varieties, whose ideals are also known as (one-sided) ladder determinantal
ideals. Using a diagonal term order to specify the (Gr\""obner) degeneration, we
show that these have geometric vertex decompositions into simpler varieties of
the same type. From this, together with the combinatorics of the pipe dreams of
[Fomin--Kirillov 1996], we derive a new formula for the numerators of their
multigraded Hilbert series, the double Grothendieck polynomials, in terms of
""flagged set-valued tableaux"". This unifies work of [Wachs 1985] on flagged
tableaux, and [Buch 2002] on set-valued tableaux, giving geometric meaning to
both.
  This work focuses on diagonal term orders, giving results complementary to
those of [Knutson--Miller 2004], where it was shown that the generating minors
form a Gr\""obner basis for any antidiagonal term order and any matrix Schubert
variety. We show here that under a diagonal term order, the only matrix
Schubert varieties for which these minors form Gr\""obner bases are the
vexillary ones, reaching an end toward which the ladder determinantal
literature had been building.

\otimes \Cl{\g}$ (which they called the noncommutative Weil algebra) for any
quadratic Lie algebra $\g$. They showed that $\mathcal{Q}$ induces an algebra
isomorphism between the basic cohomology rings $H^{\ast}_{bas}(\Weil{g})$ and
$H^{\ast}_{bas}(\NWeil{\g})$. In this paper, I interpret the quantization map
$\mathcal{Q}$ as the super Duflo map between the symmetric algebra
$S(\widetilde{T\g[1]})$ and the universal enveloping algebra
$U(\widetilde{T\g[1]})$ of a super Lie algebra $\widetilde{T\g[1]}$ which is
canonically related to the quadratic Lie algebra $\g$. The basic cohomology
rings $H^{\ast}_{bas}(\Weil{g})$ and $H^{\ast}_{bas}(\NWeil{g})$ correspond
exactly to $S(\widetilde{T\g[1]})^{inv}$ and $U(\widetilde{T\g[1]})$
respectively. So what they proved is equivalent to the fact that the Duflo map
commutes with the adjoint action of the Lie algebra, and that the Duflo map is
an algebra homomorphism when restricted to the space of invariants. In
addition, I will explain how the diagrammatic analogue of the Duflo map can be
also made for the quantization map $\mathcal{Q}$.

described according to a generalized Davydov model. The helix is modeled by
three spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units linked via covalent bonds. To
remove the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I mode and to
renormalized the vibron-phonon coupling, two unitary transformation have been
applied to reach the dressed anharmonic vibron point of view. It is shown that
the vibron dynamics results from the competition between inter-spine and
intra-spine vibron hops and that the two kinds of hopping processes do not
experience the same dressing mechanism. Therefore, at low temperature (or weak
vibron-phonon coupling), the polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized
over all the spines whereas at biological temperature (or strong vibron-phonon
coupling), the dressing effect strongly reduces the vibrational exchanges
between different spines. As a result the polaron propagates along a single
spine as in the 1D Davydov model. Although the helix supports both acoustical
and optical phonons, this feature originates in the coupling between the vibron
and the acoustical phonons, only. Finally, the lattice distortion which
accompanies the polaron has been determined and it is shown that residues
located on the excited spine are subjected to a stronger deformation than the
other residues.

disturbances in dependent variables are followed, running the dynamical system
to transport equilibrium. The third species density shows a significant
correlation with that of the electrons, regardless of initial conditions and

Companion tests with a simple two dimensional drift wave model show this
persists even if the third species is a passively advected test field.
Similarity in the transport character of electrons and the trace species does
not imply that the electrons themselves have a test particle transport
character.

off waiting time probability density functions (PDFs) contain all the

to differentiate between them by any sophisticated analyses of the trajectory.
Correlated trajectories, however, contain additional information about the

Alternatively, if one assumes that the dissociation fragments themselves can
polymerize further, then this corresponds to a strong source of short polymers,

dissociation, isotactic polymers becomes infinitely long.
