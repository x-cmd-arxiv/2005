emission from nearby ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). These sources are
bright off-nuclear X-ray point sources with luminosities exceeding L_X > 10^39

times during 5 months with the Very Large Array in A and B configuration. Our
limiting sensitivity is approximately 0.15 mJy (4 sigma) for radio flares and
around 60 uJy for continuous emission. In M82 two ULXs seem to have coincident
compact radio sources, which are probably supernova remnants. No continuous or
flaring radio emission has been detected from any other ULX. Thus, ULXs do not
generally emit steady-state radio emission above radio powers of 1.5 10^17
W/Hz. The non-detections of the continuous emission are consistent with beamed
or unbeamed radio emission from accreting black holes of <= 10^3 Msol based on
the radio/X-ray correlation. Other published radio detections (M82, NGC 5408)
are also discussed in this context. Both detections are significantly above our
detection limit. If ULXs have flaring radio emission above 4 10^17 W/Hz we can
give an upper limit on the duty circle of the flares of 6%. This upper limit is
in agreement with the observed number of flares in Galactic radio transients.
Additionally we present a yet unreported radio double structure in the nearby

  From simultaneous X-ray and radio observations this seems to be related to
the presence of a jet (level of radio emission). We propose a simple idea where
a partial absorption of the signal can shift the phases of the Fourier modes

Surrounding the SN is a richly-structured bipolar nebula. An outer,
double-lobed ``peanut,'' which we believe is the contact discontinuity between
the red supergiant and main sequence winds, is a prolate shell extending 28 ly
along the poles and 11 ly near the equator. Napoleon's Hat, previously believed
to be an independent structure, is the waist of this peanut, which is pinched
to a radius of 6 ly. Interior, the innermost circumstellar material lies along
a cylindrical hourglass, 1 ly in radius and 4 ly long, which connects to the
peanut by a thick equatorial disk. The nebulae are inclined 41o south and 8o
east of the line of sight, slightly elliptical in cross section, and marginally
offset west of the SN. The 3-D geometry of the three circumstellar rings is
studied, suggesting the equatorial ring is elliptical (b/a<0.98), and spatially
offset in the same direction as the hourglass. Dust-scattering models suggest
that between the hourglass and bipolar lobes: the gas density drops from 1--3
cm^{-3} to >0.03 cm^{-3}; the maximum dust-grain size increases from ~0.2
micron to 2 micron; and the Si:C dust ratio decreases. The nebulae have a total
mass of ~1.7 Msun, yielding a red-supergiant mass loss around 5*10^{-6} Msun

of our previous best-fitting model had to be adjusted in order to be consistent

simple rescaling of the bolometric flux F_bol is not sufficient to take the
variability of the source into account, as the change in optical depth over a
full pulsation cycle is rather high. On the other hand, the impact of a change
in effective temperature T_eff on SED and visibility is rather small. However,
observations, as well as models for other AGB stars, show the necessity of
including a variation of T_eff with pulsation phase in the radiative transfer
models. Therefore, our new best-fitting model accounts for these changes.

implies that some of the loops must reach temperatures where X-ray filters are
sensitive (> 2.5 MK) before they cool to EUV temperatures. Hence, some bright
EUV loops must be preceded by bright X-ray loops. Previous analysis of X-ray
and EUV active region observations, however, have concluded that EUV loops are
not preceded by X-ray loops. In this paper, we examine two active regions
observed in both X-ray and EUV filters and analyze the evolution of five loops
over several hours. These loops first appear bright in the X-ray images and
later appear bright in the EUV images. The delay between the appearance of the
loops in the X-ray and EUV filters is as little as 1 hour and as much as 3
hours. All five loops appear as single ``monolithic'' structures in the X-ray
images, but are resolved into many smaller structures in the (higher
resolution) EUV images. The positions of the loops appear to shift during
cooling implying that the magnetic field is changing as the loops evolve. There
is no correlation between the brightness of the loop in the X-ray and EUV
filters meaning a bright X-ray loop does not necessarily cool to a bright EUV
loop and vice versa. The progression of the loops from X-ray images to EUV
images and the observed substructure is qualitatively consistent with the IMHS
model.

problem of planet formation, transplanted from a star-centered disk to a disk
centered on the Lagrange point. The newly discovered class of Neptune Trojans
promises to test theories of planet formation by coagulation. Neptune Trojans
resembling the prototype 2001 QR322 (``QR'')--whose radius of ~100 km is
comparable to that of the largest Jupiter Trojan--may outnumber their Jovian
counterparts by a factor of ~10. We discover that seeding the 1:1 resonance
with debris from planetesimal collisions and having the seed particles accrete
in situ naturally reproduces the inferred number of QR-sized Trojans. We
analyze accretion in the Trojan sub-disk by applying the two-groups method,
accounting for kinematics specific to the resonance. We find that a Trojan
sub-disk comprising decimeter-sized seed particles and having a surface density
1e-3 that of the local minimum-mass disk produces ~10 QR-sized objects in ~1
Gyr, in accord with observation. Further growth is halted by collisional
diffusion of seed particles out of resonance. In our picture, the number and
sizes of the largest Neptune Trojans represent the unadulterated outcome of
dispersion-dominated, oligarchic accretion. Large Neptune Trojans, perhaps the
most newly accreted objects in our Solar System, may today have a dispersion in
orbital inclination of less than ~10 degrees, despite the existence of niches
of stability at higher inclinations. Such a vertically thin disk, born of a
dynamically cold environment necessary for accretion, and raised in minimal

fields. Since it is impossible to simulate the magnetic field evolution
employing the actual magnetic Reynolds numbers ($\Rm$) resulting from the
hydrodynamic simulations, (smallest) critical $\Rm$s and the corresponding
field geometries are derived on the kinematic level by rescaling the velocity
amplitudes. It turns out that the actual values of $\Rm$ are by many orders of
magnitude larger than the critical values found. A dynamo might therefore start
to act vigorously very soon after the onset of convection. But as in general
dynamo growth rates are non--monotonous functions of $\Rm$ the later fate of
the magnetic field is uncertain. Hence, no reliable statements on the existence
and efficiency of PNS dynamos can be drawn without considering the interplay of
magnetic field and convection from the beginning. Likewise, in so far as
convection inside the PNS is regarded to be essential in re--launching the
supernova explosion, a revision of its role in this respect could turn out to
be necessary.

interesting implications for understanding oxygen chemistry at sub-solar metal

  We validate the method using mock spectra obtained from hydrodynamical
simulations, and then apply it to a sample of 12 bright quasars at redshifts
2-3 observed with UVES at the VLT-UT2 Kueyen ESO telescope. These quasars do
not show signatures of associated absorption and have a mean monochromatic
luminosity of 5.4 10^{31} h^{-2} erg/s/Hz at the Lyman limit. The observed
distribution of optical depth within 10 Mpc/h from the QSO is statistically
different from that measured in the general intergalactic medium at the same
redshift. Such a change will result from the combined effects of the increase
in photoionisation rate above the mean UV-background due to the extra ionizing
photons from the quasar radiation (proximity effect), and the higher density of
the IGM if the quasars reside in overdense regions (as expected from biased
galaxy formation). The first factor decreases the optical depth whereas the
second one increases the optical depth, but our measurement cannot distinguish
a high background from a low overdensity. An overdensity of the order of a few
is required if we use the amplitude of the UV-background inferred from the mean
Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity. If no overdensity is present, then we require the
UV-background to be higher, and consistent with the existing measurements based
on standard analysis of the proximity effect.

with morphological type. Bulges of early-type spiral galaxies follow the
fundamental plane and the colour/line strength vs. luminosity relations of

distributions (SEDs) of protoplanetary disks. We investigated dust growth and
settling in protoplanetary disks through numerical simulations to examine
time-evolution of the disk optical thickness and SEDs. In the present paper, we
considered laminar disks as a first step of a series of papers. As a result of
dust growth and settling, a dust layer forms around the mid-plane of a gaseous
disk. After the formation of the dust layer, small dust grains remain floating
above the layer. Although the surface density of the floating small grains is
much less than that of the dust layer, they govern the disk optical thickness
and the emission. The floating small grains settle onto the dust layer in a
long time scale compared with the formation of the dust layer. Rapid grain
growth in the inner part of disks makes the radial distribution of the disk
optical thickness less steep than that of the disk surface density. At t >
10^6yr, the optical thickness of the inner disk (> a few AU) almost vanishes,
which may correspond to disk inner holes observed by Spitzer Space Telescope.
Furthermore, we examined time-evolution of disk SEDs, using our numerical
results and the two-layer model. The grain growth and settling decrease the
magnitude of the SEDs especially. Our results indicate that grain growth and
settling can explain the decrease in observed energy fluxes at
millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths with time scales of 10^{6-7}yr without
depletion of the disks.

loss is enhanced at mid-latitudes due to shock reflection from a torus-shaped

aim here is to intercompare the results obtained using a variety of commonly
used modelling techniques, specifically with respect to our own extensively
tested multi-dimensional approach. Any significant differences among the
resulting parameters are due to the details of the various, independently
developed modelling techniques used, rather than to the stellar population
models themselves. Despite the model uncertainties and the selection effects
inherent to most methods used, we find that the PEAKS in the relative age and
mass distributions of a given young (<= 10^9 yr) cluster system can be derived
relatively robustly and consistently, to accuracies of sigma_t = Delta <log(Age
/ yr)> <= 0.35 and sigma_M = Delta <log(M_cl / Msun)> <= 0.14, respectively,
assuming Gaussian distributions in cluster ages and masses for reasons of
simplicity. The peaks in the relative mass distributions can be obtained with a
higher degree of confidence than those in the relative age distributions, as
exemplified by the smaller spread among the peak values of the mass
distributions derived. This implies that mass determinations are mostly
insensitive to the approach adopted. We reiterate that as extensive a
wavelength coverage as possible is required to obtain robust and internally
consistent age and mass estimates for the individual objects, with reasonable
uncertainties. Finally, we conclude that the ACTUAL filter systems used for the
observations should be used for constructing model colours, instead of using
conversion equations, to achieve more accurate derivations of ages and masses.

of the uncertain O I f-values in the FUSE bandpass is not significant. Taking

result implies that ~25% of the oxygen in the Local Bubble is depleted onto

they are tuned across a Feshbach resonance associated with a fermionic
molecular state. Provided the number of fermionic atoms exceeds the number of
bosonic atoms, we argue that there is a critical detuning at which the
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is completely depleted. The phases on either
side of this quantum phase transition can also be distinguished by the distinct
Luttinger constraints on their Fermi surfaces. In both phases, the total volume
enclosed by all Fermi surfaces is constrained by the total number of fermions.
However, in the phase without the BEC, which has two Fermi surfaces, there is a
_second_ Luttinger constraint: the volume enclosed by one of the Fermi surfaces
is constrained by the total number of_bosons_, so that the volumes enclosed by
the two Fermi surfaces are separately conserved. The phase with the BEC may
have one or two Fermi surfaces, but only their total volume is conserved. We
obtain the phase diagram as a function of atomic parameters and temperature,
and describe critical fluctuations in the vicinity of all transitions. We make
quantitative predictions valid for the case of a narrow Feshbach resonance, but
we expect the qualitative features we describe to be more generally applicable.
As an aside, we point out intriguing connections between the BEC depletion
transition and the transition to the fractionalized Fermi liquid in Kondo

from a superposition of Gaussian distributions for subsystems that have a
particular energy dissipation rate at a fixed length scale [Castaing et al.,

the value of an intensive variable (inverse ``effective temperature'') in each
subsystem [Beck and Cohen, {\it Physica A} {\bf 322}, 267 (2003)]. The

thermodynamic equilibrium of a vesicle adhering to a flat substrate. The
vesicle is treated in a canonical description with a fixed number of sites. A
finite number of these sites are occupied by mobile ligands that are capable of
interacting with a discrete number of receptors immobilized on the substrate.
Explicit consideration of the bending energy of the vesicle shape has shown
that the problem of the vesicle shape can be decoupled from the determination
of the optimum allocation of ligands over the vesicle. The allocation of bound
and free ligands in the vesicle could be determined as a function of the size
of the contact zone, the ligand-receptor binding strength and the concentration
of the system constituents. Several approximate solutions for different regions
of system parameters are determined and in particular, the distinction between
receptor-dominated equilibria and ligand-dominated equilibria is found to be
important. The crossover between these two types of solutions is found to occur
at a critical size of the contact zone. The presented approach enables the
calculation of the effective adhesion strength of the vesicle and thus permits
meaningful comparisons with relevant experiments as well as connecting the
presented model with the proven success of the continuum approach for modeling
the shapes of adhering vesicles. The behavior of the effective adhesion
strength is analyzed in detail and several approximate expressions for it are
given.

the stringent, and expensive, requirements on the orbital geometry of the
originally prosed LARES mission (same semimajor axis a=12270 km of the existing
LAGEOS and inclination i=70 deg) by inserting the new spacecraft in a
relatively low, and cheaper, orbit (a=7500-8000 km, i\sim 70 deg) and suitably
combining its node Omega with those of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II in order to cancel
out the first even zonal harmonic coefficients of the multipolar expansion of
the terrestrial gravitational potential J_2, J_4 along with their temporal
variations. The total systematic error due to the mismodelling in the remaining
even zonal harmonics would amount to \sim 1% and would be insensitive to
departures of the inclination from the originally proposed value of many
degrees. No semisecular long-period perturbations would be introduced because
the period of the node, which is also the period of the solar K_1 tidal
perturbation, would amount to \sim 10^2 days. Since the coefficient of the node
of the new satellite would be smaller than 0.1 for such low altitudes, the
impact of the non-gravitational perturbations of it on the proposed combination
would be negligible. Then, a particular financial and technological effort for
suitably building the satellite in order to minimize the non-conservative
accelerations would be unnecessary.

tool to discriminate between the Dirac and Majorana types of neutrinos and to
survey the structure of the weak interaction. It is assumed that massive
neutrinos mix with one another and that the interaction Hamiltonian consists of
the $V-A$ and $V+A$ charged currents. A new set of parameters used in place of
the Michel parameters is proposed for the positron distribution. Explicit forms
of these new parameters are obtained by assuming that the masses are less than
10 eV for light neutrinos and sufficiently large for heavy Majorana neutrinos,
which are not emitted in the muon decay. It is shown that a possible method to
discriminate between the Dirac and Majorana cases is to use a characterization
given by the $\chi^2$ fitting of their spectra. It is also confirmed that the
theoretical predictions in the Majorana neutrino case are almost the same as
those obtained from the standard model. Indeed, their differences cannot be
distinguished within the present experimental precision.

Calabi-Yau fourfolds are important for dualities between string
compactifications with four flat space-time dimensions. A natural framework for
studying explicit examples of such fibrations is given by Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces in toric varieties, because this class of varieties is
sufficiently large to provide examples with very different features while still
allowing a large degree of explicit control. In this paper, many examples for
elliptic K3 fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds are found (not constructed) by
searching for reflexive subpolyhedra of reflexive polyhedra corresponding to
hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces. Subpolyhedra not always give rise
to fibrations and the obstructions are studied. In addition, perturbative gauge
algebras for dual heterotic string theories are determined. In order to do so,
all elliptically fibered toric K3 surfaces are determined. Then, the
corresponding gauge algebras are calculated without specialization to
particular polyhedra for the elliptic fibers. Finally, the perturbative gauge
algebras for the fourfold fibrations are extracted from the generic fibers and

correcting codes and to reconstruction of signals from few linear measurements.
An error correcting code encodes an n-letter word x into an m-letter word y in
such a way that x can be decoded correctly when any r letters of y are
corrupted. We prove that most linear orthogonal transformations Q from R^n into
R^m form efficient and robust robust error correcting codes over reals. The
decoder (which corrects the corrupted components of y) is the metric projection
onto the range of Q in the L_1 norm. An equivalent problem arises in signal
processing: how to reconstruct a signal that belongs to a small class from few
linear measurements? We prove that for most sets of Gaussian measurements, all
signals of small support can be exactly reconstructed by the L_1 norm
minimization. This is a substantial improvement of recent results of Donoho and
of Candes and Tao. An equivalent problem in combinatorial geometry is the
existence of a polytope with fixed number of facets and maximal number of
lower-dimensional facets. We prove that most sections of the cube form such
polytopes.

shift by means of the effective-range expansion featuring values found for the

on photoluminescence of well characterized water and prepared under controlled
conditions (container, atmospheric, electromagnetic, and acoustic
environments). When reference water samples were excited at 260 nm, two wide
emission bands centered at 345 nm (3.6 eV) and 425 nm (2.9 eV) were observed.
By contrast under 310 nm excitation, only one band appeared at 425 nm.
Interestingly, electromagnetic treatment (EMT) induced, at both excitation
wavelengths, a decrease (around 70%) in the 425 nm band relative
photoluminescence intensity. However, no difference between reference and
treated sample was observed in the 345 nm band. Other experiments, performed on
outgassed samples (reference and treated), show that the emission bands
(position, shape, intensity) under excitation at 260 nm and 310 nm were similar
and close to the corresponding bands of the treated nonoutgassed samples.
Similar effects were observed on photoluminescence excitation of water samples.
Two excitation bands monitored at 425 nm were observed at 272 nm and 330 nm.
After EMT and/or outgassing, a decrease (> 60%) was observed in the intensity
of these two bands. Altogether, these results indicate that electromagnetic
treatment and/or outgassing decrease in a similar fashion the photoluminescence
intensity in water samples. They also suggest that this effect is most likely
indirectly attributed to the presence of gas bubbles in water. The possible
role of hydrated ionic shell around the bubbles in the observed
extraluminescence is discussed.

has been characterized by mutational Phi-value analysis. In this article, a
simple, essentially parameter-free model is introduced which derives folding
routes from native structures by minimizing the entropic loop-closure cost
during folding. The model predicts characteristic folding sequences of
structural elements such as helices and beta-strand pairings. Based on few
simple rules, the kinetic impact of these structural elements is estimated from
the routes and compared to average experimental Phi-values for the helices and
strands of 15 small, well-characterized proteins. The comparison leads on
average to a correlation coefficient of 0.62 for all proteins with polarized
Phi-value distributions, and 0.74 if distributions with negative average
Phi-values are excluded. The diffuse Phi-value distributions of the remaining
proteins are reproduced correctly. The model shows that Phi-value
distributions, averaged over secondary structural elements, can often be traced
back to entropic loop-closure events, but also indicates energetic preferences
in the case of a few proteins governed by parallel folding processes.

distinguishability of these operators is quantified by the minimum overlap of
the output states over all possible input probe states. The entangling capacity
of the original unitary operator is therefore directly related to the degree of
non-Hermiticity of its canonical form, as quantified in an operationally
satisfactory manner in terms of the extent to which it can be distinguished, by
measurement, from its adjoint. Furthermore, the maximum entropy of
entanglement, again without local ancillas, that a given two-qubit unitary
