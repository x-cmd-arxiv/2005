SAMs incorporate simplified physical treatments of the key processes of galaxy

oscillations of $\beta$ Cephei stars which are often rapidly rotating stars.
Our study shows that the third-order perturbation formalism presented by Soufi

the equations. As a first step in our study of $\beta$ Cephei stars, we
quantify by numerical calculations the effect of rotation on the oscillation
frequencies of a uniformly rotating zero-age main-sequence star with
12~$M_\odot$. For an equatorial velocity of 100~$\rm km \, s^{-1}$, it is found
that the second- and third-order corrections for $(l,m)=(2,2)$, for instance,
are of order of 0.01$\%$ of the frequency for radial order $n=6$ and reaches up

consideration of the data leaves us with only one pair (M3 and M13) of clusters
good for a quantitative discussion. For this pair we consider differences in
age and helium content as possible causes for the difference in Delta
V_{TO}^{bump}, and find more convincing support for the latter. A larger helium
content in M13 stars (Y~0.28 vs. Y~0.24) accounts for various CM diagram
features, such as the difference in the luminosity level of RR Lyr variables
and of the red giant bump with respect to the turnoff luminosity, and the
horizontal branch morphology. This enhanced helium can be tentatively
understood in the framework of self--enrichment by massive asymptotic giant
branch stars in the first ~100 Myr of the cluster life. A modest
self--enrichment can be present also in M3 and can be the reason for the still
unexplained presence of a not negligible number of luminous, Oosterhoff II type

parameter for clusters with very blue horizontal branch morphology could be
checked by an accurate set of data for more clusters giving turnoff, RR Lyrs

double degenerate mergers are excluded as SN Ia progenitors, we find that the

massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are
found at the centers of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to
the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass
of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of
the black holes and the host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a
number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole
mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of
galaxies have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously
follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy
collisions. We find that in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a
merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and
thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas
to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines
the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains
the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity
dispersion.

to detect the gradT SZE signal by broad-band or multi-frequency observations of

electron density and is proportional to the heat conductivity. Therefore, the
gradT SZE provides an unique opportunity to measure thermally nonequilibrium

and the heat conductivity in the ICM. However, the expected amplitude of the

These measurements, along with modeling of the broadband knot emission that
constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the jets, can yield estimates of the jet
power carried by protons and leptons. We provide an explicit calculation of the
spectrum of the bulk-Comptonized (BC) CMB component and apply these results to
PKS 0637--752 and 3C 273, two superluminal quasars with Chandra-detected large

is the absence of significant non-thermal jet emission in the `bridge', the
region between the core and the first bright jet knot, which guarantees that
most of the electrons are cold there, leaving the BC scattered CMB radiation as
the only significant source of photons in this region. At lambda=3.6-8.0
microns the most likely band to observe the BC scattered CMB emission, the
Spitzer angular resolution (~ 1''-3) is considerably smaller than the `bridges'

explore the effect that changing the correlation between the strong-line

find that the slope of the L-Z relationship decreases as the wavelength of the
luminosity bandpass increases. We interpret this as being, at least in part, an
effect of internal absorption in the host galaxy. Furthermore, the dispersion
in the L-Z relation decreases for the NIR bands, suggesting that variations in
internal absorption contribute significantly to the observed scatter. We
propose that our NIR L-Z relations are more fundamental than the B-band
relation, since they are largely free of absorption effects and the NIR
luminosities are more directly related to the stellar mass of the galaxy than
are the optical luminosities.

Peculiar/Irregulars) to a limit of z_AB=22.5 and make the resulting catalog

the GOODS catalog and deep K-band imaging to assign stellar masses. We find
little evolution in the form of the galaxy stellar mass function from z~1 to
z=0, especially at the high mass end where our results are most robust.
Although the population of massive galaxies is relatively well established at
z~1, its morphological mix continues to change, with an increasing proportion
of early-type galaxies at later times. By constructing type-dependent stellar
mass functions, we show that in each of three redshift intervals, E/S0's
dominate the higher mass population, while spirals are favored at lower masses.
This transition occurs at a stellar mass of 2--3 times 10^{10} Msun at z~0.3
(similar to local studies) but there is evidence that the relevant mass scale
moves to higher mass at earlier epochs. Such evolution may represent the
morphological extension of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon, in which the most
massive galaxies stop forming stars first, with lower mass galaxies becoming
quiescent later. We infer that more massive galaxies evolve into spheroidal
systems at earlier times, and that this morphological transformation may only
be completed 1--2 Gyr after the galaxies emerge from their active star forming
phase. We discuss several lines of evidence suggesting that merging may play a
key role in generating this pattern of evolution.

Neutron emission generates most solar energy. Neutron-decay near the core

large number of different theoretical models are presently being discussed. In
one way or another, all of these contain `new physics', though at different
levels. The big question is how to select out of infinitely many possible
models the right one. Here we discuss a possibility that has so far been
somewhat neglected, namely that the new physics underlying dark energy arises
out of a gravitationally active amendment of the electroweak and strong sector
of the standard model. This amendment basically consists of a rapidly
fluctuating gravitationally active dynamics of vacuum fluctuations with a

for this based on second-quantized self-interacting scalar fields, which evolve
in a chaotic way. It is shown that expectations with respect to the chaotic

  Magnetic Fields in the Universe, Angra dos Reis, Brazil, November, 2004",,"10.1063/1.2077205",,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  The universe cools down monotonically following its expansion.This generates
a sequence of phase transitions. If a second order phase transition happens
during the radiation dominated era with a charged order parameter, spinodal
unstabilities generate large numbers of charged particles. These particles
hence produce magnetic fields.We use out of equilibrium field theory methods to
study the dynamics in a mean field or large N setup.The dynamics after the
transition features two distinct stages: a spinodal regime dominated by linear
long wave length instabilities, and a scaling stage in which the
non-linearities and backreaction of the scalar fields are dominant. This second
stage describes the growth of horizon sized domains. We implement a formulation
based on the non equilibrium Schwinger-Dyson equations to obtain the spectrum
of magnetic fields that includes the dissipative effects of the plasma. We find
that large scale magnetogenesis is efficient during the scaling regime. Charged
scalar field fluctuations with wavelengths of the order of the Hubble radius
induce large scale magnetogenesis via loop effects.The leading processes
are:pair production, pair annihilation and low energy bremsstrahlung, these
processes while forbidden in equilibrium are allowed strongly out of
equilibrium. The ratio between the energy density on scales larger than L and
that in the background radiation r(L,T)= rho_B(L,T)/rho_{cmb}(T) is r(L,T) ~
10^{-34} at the Electroweak scale and r(L,T) ~ 10^{-14} at the QCD scale for L
sim 1 Mpc. The resulting spectrum is insensitive to the magnetic diffusion
length and equipartition between electric and magnetic fields does not hold. We
conjecture that a similar mechanism could be operative after the QCD chiral
phase transition.

matter haloes at redshifts z\approx 60 (Diemand et al. 2005). These abundant
CDM micro-haloes have cuspy density profiles that can easily withstand the
Galactic tidal field at the solar radius. Zhao, Taylor, Silk & Hooper
(astro-ph/0502049) concluded that ``...the majority of dark matter
substructures with masses \sim 10^{-6}M_o will be tidally disrupted due to
interactions with stars in the Galactic halo''. However these authors assumed a
halo density of stars that is at least an order of magnitude higher than
observed. We show that the appropriate application of the impulse approximation
is to the regime of multiple encounters, not single disruptive events as
adopted by Zhao et al., which leads to a survival time of several Hubble times.
Therefore we do not expect the tidal heating by Galactic stars to affect the
abundance of micro-haloes. Disk crossing will cause some mass loss but the
central cores are likely to survive and could be detected as gamma-ray sources
with proper motions of several arc minutes per year.

penetration of the ZOA with the in 2003 released NIR 2MASX Catalog. The

identified to extinction levels of over A(B) < 10m except in the wider Galactic
Bulge region (see Fig. 9) where star density is a strong delimiting factor. The

spiral arms and the Bulge, something that should not be ignored when using NIR
samples for studies such as dipole determinations.

the Fermi level. While its dispersion in the $z$ direction is negligibly small
for BLH, it is of the order of 0.1 eV for MLH. This result implies that the
three dimensional feature of the $a_{1g}$ band may be the origin for the
absence of superconductivity in MLH.

variety of different regions in a typical phase diagram of HTSC can be given in
terms of the model of negative-U centers superconductivity. Both the existence
of four regions (pseudogap, superconducting, non Fermi-liquid and
Fermi-liquid), in the phase diagram and all the transitions between these
regions were explained by assuming that negative-U centers exist in HTSC and
qualitatively taking into account their thermodynamic and direct

It is found that the principal parameter determining the properties of HTSC in
the model of negative-U centers is the relative concentration of electrons
belonging to negative-U centers. The negative-U centers naturally determine
both the superconducting properties of HTSC systems and the entire phase

spin/charge channels and the route to solitons, 4kF anomaly, dimerization gap,
role of ionic transitions. New phenomena unify an unusual variety of concepts:
ferroelectricity of good conductors, structural instability towards
Mott-Hubbard state, Wigner crystallization in a dense electronic system,
ordered 4kF density wave, richness of physics of solitons, interplay of
structural and electronic symmetries. The ferroelectric state gives rise to
several types of solitons carrying the electron charge, a noninteger charge,
spin or both the spin and the charge in special cases. They are clearly
observed via conductivity, electric and magnetic susceptibilities. Solitons are
challenging for optics where they already seem to determine the pseudogap in
absorption. Various features also appear, or are expected, from collective
electronic and coupled electron-phonon modes. The last topic, as well as some
aspects of physics of solitons, recalls also the contributions of M.J. Rice.

(INS) on a high quality sample of peapods. The comparison of the
neutron-derived generalized phonon density of states (GDOS) of the peapods

chains encapsulated in the hollow core of the SWNTs to be probed. Lattice
dynamical models are used to calculate the GDOS of chains of monomers, dimers
and polymers inserted into SWNTs, which are compared to the experimental data.
The presence of strong interactions between C60 cages inside the nanotube is
clearly demonstrated by an excess of mode density in the frequency range around
10 meV. However, the presence of a quasi-elastic signal indicates that some of
the C60\'s undergo rotational motion. This suggests that peapods are made from
a mixture of C60 monomers and C60 n-mer (dimer, trimer ... polymer) structures.

no effect on either the magnitude or the direction of the spins. Using the

with lower energy decay before reaching the Earth and produce a detectable flux
in a 1 km^3 neutrino telescope. The initial flavor composition of these

the opportunity to perform a combined \bar\nu_\mu/\bar\nu_\tau appearance and

\phi(\bar\nu_\mu)/\phi(\bar\nu_e+\bar\nu_\tau) of fluxes arriving on Earth

two inequivalent fundamental representations $A$ and $B$ of the Dirac gamma
matrices. Moreover, the parity transformation swaps the fermion fields living
in $A$ and $B$. As a consequence, a parity invariant Lagrangian can only be
constructed by incorporating both the representations. Based upon these ideas
and contrary to long held belief, we show that in addition to a discrete
exchange symmetry for the massless case, we can also define chiral symmetry
provided the Lagrangian contains fields corresponding to both the inequivalent
representations. We also study the transformation properties of the
corresponding chiral currents under parity and charge conjugation operations.
We work explicitly in 2+1 dimensions and later show how some of these ideas
generalize to an arbitrary number of odd dimensions.

giving rise to neutrino masses consists of the introduction of one righthanded

mechanism this leads to three light and three heavy neutrinos. The charged
current interactions couple the charged leptons to both the light and the heavy
physical neutrinos and leptonic CP violation may occur at low energies as well
as at high energies giving rise to the possibility of leptogenesis. There are
special scenarios where it is possible to establish a connection between CP
violation at the two different scales, an interesting example is included in
this work. Furthermore, we describe how the conjecture that all phenomena of CP
violation present in nature could have a common origin can be realized in the
framework of a further minimal extension of the Standard Model with CP broken

of some interesting examples, including the commutative S-algebras ku, ko, tmf,
ju and j, and to calculate the homotopy groups of THH(ku) and THH(ko) after
smashing with suitable finite complexes. This is part of a program to make
systematic computations of the algebraic K-theory of S-algebras, by means of

closed to a Kaehler Einstein metric, then the Kaehler Ricci flow converges to
it. The present work should be viewed as a first step in a more ambitious
program of deriving the existence of Kaehler Einstein metrics with an arbitrary
energy level, provided that this energy functional has a uniform lower bound in
this Kaehler class.

numbers of small individual sellers and buyers. However, over the past fifty
years mutual funds and other institutional shareholders have assumed an ever
increasing part of stock transactions: their assets, as a percentage of GDP,
have been multiplied by more than one hundred. The paper presents evidence
which shows that reactions to major shocks are often dominated by a small
number of institutional players. Most often the market gets a wrong perception
and inadequate understanding of such events because the relevant information
(e.g. the fact that one mutual fund has sold several million shares) only
becomes available weeks or months after the event, through reports to the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our observations suggest that there
is a radical difference between small ($ < 0.5% $) day-to-day price variations
which may be due to the interplay of many agents and large ($ >5% $) price
changes which, on the contrary, may be caused by massive sales (or purchases)
by a few players. This suggests that the mechanisms which account for large

can be considered as fairly robust with respect to various, endogenous or
exogenous, sources of noise. (iv) The relevant data are available on the

that there is a missing variable in most consensus formation simulations. In
its conclusion, the paper calls for a large scale effort for identifying,

with close relatives) and the occurrence of suicide. The objective is to
discriminate between a model based on social ties and a model based on
psychological traumas. Our methodological strategy is to focus on instances
characterized by the severance of some social ties. We consider several
situations of this kind. (i) Prisoners in the first days after their
incarceration. (ii) Prisoners in solitary confinement. (iii) Prisoners who are
transferred from one prison to another. (iv) Prisoners in closed versus open
prisons. (v) Prisoners in the weeks following their release. (vi) Immigrants in
the years following their relocation. (vii) Unmarried versus married people.
  Furthermore, in order to test the impact of major shocks we consider the
responses in terms of suicides to the following shocks. (i) The attack of
September 11, 2001 in Manhattan. (ii) The Korean War. (iii) The two world wars.
(iv) The Great Depression in the United States. (v) The hyperinflation episode
of 1923 in Germany. Major global traumatic shocks such as 9/11 or wars have no
influence on suicide rates once changing environment conditions have been
controlled for.
  Overall, it turns out that the observations have a natural interpretation in
terms of short-range ties. In contrast, the trauma model seems unable to
adequately account for many observations.

occurrence of large earthquakes. The model idealizes the loading of elastic
energy in a seismic fault by the stochastic filling of a box. The emptying of
the box after it is full is analogous to the generation of a large earthquake
in which the fault relaxes after having been loaded to its failure threshold.
The duration of the filling process is analogous to the seismic cycle, the time
interval between two successive large earthquakes in a particular fault. The
simplicity of the model enables us to derive the statistical distribution of
its seismic cycle. We use this distribution to fit the series of earthquakes
with magnitude around 6 that occurred at the Parkfield segment of the San
Andreas fault in California. Using this fit, we estimate the probability of the
next large earthquake at Parkfield and devise a simple forecasting strategy.

Linearized calculations show that the oscillating mode uniform over the length

longitudinal momentum grow exponentially. In the limit of strong atom
interactions, we give scaling laws for the instability time constant and
unstable wave vectors. Beyond the linearized approach, numerical calculations
show a damped recurrence behavior : the energy in the Josephson mode presents
damped oscillations. Finally, we derive conditions on the confinement of the
condensates to prevent instabilities.

approach, we relate optical properties such as emission and absorption to
equilibrium force-force correlation functions, which allow for a systematic
perturbative treatment with the help of thermodynamic Green functions. By
considering self-energy and vertex corrections, medium modifications such as
multiple scattering of the emitting electrons are taken into account. Results
are presented for the absorption coefficient as a function of the frequency at
various densities. It is shown that the modification of the inverse
bremsstrahlung due to medium effects becomes more significant in the low
frequency and high density region.

of the classical, and well-studied, binary adder channel: in this model qubits
rather than classical bits are transmitted. This of course is as special case
of the general theory of quantum multiple access channels, and we may apply the
established formulas for the capacity region to it. However, the binary adder
channel is of particular interest classically, which motivates our generalizing
it to the quantum domain. It turns out to be a very nice case study not only of
multi-user quantum information theory, but also on the role entanglement plays
there. It turns out that the analogous classical situation, the multi-user
channel supported by shared randomness, is not distinct from the channel
without shared randomness, as far as rates are concerned. However, we discuss
the effect the new resource has on error probabilities, in an appendix.
  We focus specially on the effect entanglement between the senders as well as
between senders and receiver has on the capacity region. Interestingly, in some
of these cases one can devise rather simple codes meeting the capacity bounds,
even in a zero-error model, which is in marked difference to code construction
in the classical case.

between quantum and classical reaction and transmission probabilities,
primarily by increasing the energy dispersion in a well defined way. Increased
