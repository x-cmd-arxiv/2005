best fitting models have virial masses of ~10^9 M_Sun, halo formation redshifts
consistent with the age of oldest stars in these dwarfs, and shallow inner dark
matter density profiles (with slope gamma -0.5...0). The inferred temperature
of gas is ~10^4 K. In our model, the ""extratidal"" stars observed in the

galaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos. The inferred virial
masses make Galactic dwarf spheroidals massive enough to alleviate the ""missing

$z=0.297$ quasar E1821+643. The absorption line is detected at a confidence
level, estimated by two different methods, in the range ~2-3 sigma. Although
the detection significance is not high enough to exclude a non-astrophysical
origin, accounting for the absorption feature when modeling the X-ray spectrum
implies that the Fe-K emission line is broad, and consistent with an origin in
a relativistic accretion disk. Ignoring the apparent absorption feature leads
to the conclusion that the Fe-K emission line is narrower, and also affects the
inferred peak energy of the line (and hence the inferred ionization state of
Fe). If the absorption line (at ~6.2 keV in the quasar frame) is real, we argue
that it could be due to gravitationally redshifted Fe XXV or Fe XXVI resonance
absorption within ~10-20 gravitational radii of the putative central black
hole. The absorption line is not detected in earlier low-energy grating
observations, but is not unequivocally ruled out by these data. The Chandra
high-energy grating Fe K emission line is consistent with an origin
predominantly in Fe I-XVII or so. In a previous LEG observation the line was
double-peaked, at ~6.4 keV and ~6.9 keV (H-like Fe). Such a wide range in
ionization state of Fe is not ruled out by the HEG data and an earlier ASCA
observation, and is suggestive of a complex structure for the line-emitter.

difference may reflect the relative importance of magnetic fields and
turbulence in controlling star formation. We investigate the interplay between
supersonic turbulence and magnetic fields using numerical simulations, in a
sheet-like geometry. We demonstrate that star formation with an efficiency of a
few percent can occur over several gravitational collapse times in moderately
magnetically subcritical clouds that are supersonically turbulent. The
turbulence accelerates star formation by reducing the time for dense core
formation. The dense cores produced are predominantly quiescent, with subsonic
internal motions. These cores tend to be moderately supercritical. They have
lifetimes long compared with their local gravitational collapse time. Some of
the cores collapse to form stars, while others disperse away without star
formation. In turbulent clouds that are marginally magnetically supercritical,
the star formation efficiency is higher, but can still be consistent with the
values inferred for nearby embedded clusters. If not regulated by magnetic
fields at all, star formation in a multi-Jeans mass cloud endowed with a strong
initial turbulence proceeds rapidly, with the majority of cloud mass converted
into stars in a gravitational collapse time. The efficiency is formally higher
than the values inferred for nearby cluster-forming cores, indicating that
magnetic fields are dynamically important even for cluster formation.

rapidly accreting (Mdot > 10^{-7} M_sun/yr) CO white dwarfs may rotate
differentially, with a shear rate near the threshold value for the onset of the
dynamical shear instability. Such differentially rotating white dwarfs obtain
critical masses for thermonuclear explosion or electron-capture induced
collapse which significantly exceed the canonical Chandrasekhar limit. Here, we
construct two-dimensional differentially rotating white dwarf models with
rotation laws resembling those of the one-dimensional models of Yoon & Langer
(2004a). We derive analytic relations between the white dwarf mass, its angular
momentum, and its rotational-, gravitational- and binding energy. We show that
these relations are applicable for a wide range of angular velocity profiles,
including solid body rotation. We demonstrate that pre-explosion and
pre-collapse conditions of both, rigidly and differentially rotating white
dwarfs are well established by the present work, which may facilitate future
multi-dimensional simulations of Type Ia supernova explosions and studies of
the formation of millisecond pulsars and gamma-ray bursts from collapsing white
dwarfs.Our results lead us to suggest various possible evolutionary scenarios
for progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, leading to a new paradigm of a variable
mass of exploding white dwarfs, at values well above the classical
Chandrasekhar mass. Based on our 2D-models, we argue for the supernova peak
brightness being proportional to the white dwarf mass, which could explain
various aspects of the diversity of Type Ia supernovae, such as their variation
in brightness, the dependence of their mean luminosity on the host galaxy type,
and the weak correlation between ejecta velocity and peak brightness.

of Damped Ly alpha (DLA) systems. We show that the extinction of any Galactic
or extragalactic HI region increases with the column density of zinc with a
turning point above which background sources are suddenly obscured. We derive a
relation between the extinction of a DLA system and its HI column density, N,
metallicity, Z, fraction of iron in dust, f_Fe(Z), and redshift, z. From this
relation we estimate the fraction of DLA systems missed as a consequence of
their own extinction in magnitude-limited surveys. We derive a method for
recovering the true frequency distributions of N and Z in DLAs, f_N and f_Z,
using the biased distributions measured in the redshift range where the
observations have sufficient statistics (1.8 </= z </= 3). By applying our
method we find that the well-known empirical thresholds of DLA column
densities, N(ZnII) </~ 10^13.1 cm^-2 and N(HI) </~ 10^22 cm^-2 can be
successfully explained in terms of the obscuration effect without tuning of the
local dust parameters. The obscuration has a modest effect on the distribution
of quasar apparent magnitudes, but plays an important role in shaping the
statistical distributions of DLAs. The exact estimate of the bias is still
limited by the paucity of the data (~40 zinc measurements at 1.8 </~ z </~ 3).
We find that the fraction of DLAs missed as a consequence of obscuration is
\~30% to 50%, consistent with the results of surveys of radio-selected quasars.
By modelling the metallicity distribution with a Schechter function we find
that the mean metallicity can be ~5 to 6 times higher than the value commonly
reported for DLAs at z~2.3.

states. In 1$B_{u}$ PA spectrum they identified two main features namely PA1
and PA2. While in the 2$A_{g}$ spectrum they identified only one feature called
PA$_{g}$. In this paper we present a theoretical study of 1$B_{u}$ and 2$A_{g}$
PA spectra of oligo-PDPA's using correlated-electron Pariser-Parr-Pople (P-P-P)
model and various configuration interaction (CI) methodologies. We compare the
calculated spectra with the experiments, as well as with the calculated spectra
of polyenes of the same conjugation lengths. Calculated spectra are in good
agreement with the experiments. Based upon our calculations, we identify PA1 as
the m$A_{g}$ state and PA$_{g}$ as the $nB_{u}$ state of the polymer. Regarding
the PA2 feature, we present our speculations. Additionally, it is argued that
the nature of excited states contributing to the $2A_{g}$-PA spectra of
oligo-PDPA's is qualitatively different from those contributing to the spectra
of polyenes.

  Cu2Te2O5Cl2",,,"10.1063/1.2008143",,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Neutron scattering studies on powder and single crystals have provided new
evidences for unconventional magnetism in Cu2Te2O5Cl2. The compound is built
from tetrahedral clusters of S=1/2 Cu2+ spins located on a tetragonal lattice.
Magnetic ordering, emerging at TN=18.2 K, leads to a very complex multi-domain,
most likely degenerate, ground state, which is characterized by an
incommensurate (ICM) wave vector k ~ [0.15, 0.42,1/2]. The Cu2+ ions carry a
magnetic moment of 0.67(1) mB/ Cu2+ at 1.5 K and form a four helices spin
arrangement with two canted pairs within the tetrahedra. A domain
redistribution is observed when a magnetic field is applied in the tetragonal
plane (Hc&#8776;0.5 T), but not for H||c up to 4 T. The excitation spectrum is
characterized by two well-defined modes, one completely dispersionless at 6.0
meV, the other strongly dispersing to a gap of 2 meV. The reason for such
complex ground state and spin excitations may be geometrical frustration of the
Cu2+ spins within the tetrahedra, intra- and inter-tetrahedral couplings having
similar strengths and strong Dzyaloshinski-Moriya anisotropy. Candidates for
the dominant intra- and inter-tetrahedral interactions are proposed.

criticality, significant gains in computational efficiency may be had by
confining the particles to the sites of a lattice of sufficiently fine spacing,
$a_{0}$ (relative to the particle size, say $a$). But a cardinal question,
investigated here, then arises, namely: How does the choice of the lattice
discretization parameter, $\zeta\equiv a/a_{0}$, affect the values of
interesting parameters, specifically, critical temperature and density,
$T_{\scriptsize c}$ and $\rho_{\scriptsize c}$? Indeed, for small $\zeta
(\lesssim 4 $-$ 8)$ the underlying lattice can strongly influence the
thermodynamic properties. A heuristic argument, essentially exact in $d=1$ and
$d=2$ dimensions, indicates that for models with hard-core potentials, both
$T_{\scriptsize c}(\zeta)$ and $\rho_{\scriptsize c}(\zeta)$ should converge to
their continuum limits as $1/\zeta^{(d+1)/2}$ for $d\leq 3$ when
$\zeta\to\infty$; but the behavior of the error is highly erratic for $d\geq
2$. For smoother interaction potentials, the convergence is faster. Exact
results for $d=1$ models of van der Waals character confirm this; however, an
optimal choice of $\zeta$ can improve the rate of convergence by a factor
$1/\zeta$. For $d\geq 2$ models, the convergence of the {\em second virial
coefficients} to their continuum limits likewise exhibit erratic behavior which
is seen to transfer similarly to $T_{\scriptsize c}$ and $\rho_{\scriptsize
c}$; but this can be used in various ways to enhance convergence and improve
extrapolation to $\zeta = \infty$ as is illustrated using data for the
restricted primitive model electrolyte.

the energy fluctuation as a function of time tends to an asymptotic value

Multiobjective hBOA (mohBOA) is then described that combines hBOA, NSGA-II and

multiobjective variants of BOA and hBOA proposed in the past by including
clustering in the objective space and allocating an approximately equally sized

basis, we study various observables that involve the K* spin amplitudes Aperp,
Apar, A0 by exploiting the heavy-to-light form factor relations in the heavy
quark and large-E_K* limit. We find that at leading order in 1/m_b and alpha_s
the form-factor dependence of the asymmetries that involve transversely
polarized K* completely drops out. At next-to-leading logarithmic order,
including factorizable and non-factorizable corrections, the theoretical errors
for the transverse asymmetries turn out to be small in the standard model (SM).
Integrating over the lower part of the dimuon mass region, and varying the
theoretical input parameters, the SM predicts A_T^(1)=0.9986+/- 0.0002 and
A_T^(2)=-0.043+/- 0.003. In addition, the longitudinal and transverse
polarization fractions are found to be (69+/-3)% and (31+/-3)% respectively, so
that Gamma_L/Gamma_T = 2.23+/-0.31. Beyond the SM, we focus on new physics that
mainly gives sizable contributions to the coefficients C_7^eff' of the
electromagnetic dipole operators. Taking into account experimental data on rare
B decays, we find large effects of new physics in the transverse asymmetries.
Furthermore, we show that a measurement of longitudinal and transverse
polarization fractions will provide complementary information on physics beyond
the SM.

  We establish the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem within the class of
conservative solutions, for initial data having finite energy and assuming that
the flux function $f$ has Lipschitz continuous second-order derivative. In the
case where $f$ is convex, the Cauchy problem is well-posed also within the
class of dissipative solutions. However, when $f$ is not convex, we show that
the dissipative solutions do not depend continuously on the initial data.

one of the earliest, but still one of the most elegant, classification results
in dynamical systems. Here we generalize this to quasiperiodically forced
circle homeomorphisms, which have been the subject of considerable interest in
recent years. Herman already showed two decades ago that a unique rotation
number exists for all orbits in the quasiperiodically forced case. However,
unlike the unforced case, no a priori bounds exist for the deviations from the
average rotation. This plays an important role in the attempted classification,
and in fact we define a system as regular if such deviations are bounded and
irregular otherwise. For the regular case we prove a close analogue of
Poincare's result: if the rotation number is rationally related to the rotation
rate on the base then there exists an invariant strip (an appropriate analogue
for fixed or periodic points in this context), otherwise the system is
semi-conjugate to an irrational translation of the torus. In the irregular
case, where neither of these two alternatives can occur, we show that the
dynamics are always topologically transitive.

technological systems. Here I argue that networks provide a coherent framework
to construct coarse-grained models for many different physical systems. To
elucidate these ideas, I discuss two long-standing problems. The first concerns
the structure and dynamics of magnetic fields in the solar corona, as
exemplified by sunspots that startled Galileo almost 400 years ago. We
discovered that the magnetic structure of the corona embodies a scale free
network, with spots at all scales. A network model representing the
three-dimensional geometry of magnetic fields, where links rewire and nodes
merge when they collide in space, gives quantitative agreement with available
data, and suggests new measurements. Seismicity is addressed in terms of
relations between events without imposing space-time windows. A metric
estimates the correlation between any two earthquakes. Linking strongly
correlated pairs, and ignoring pairs with weak correlation organizes the
spatio-temporal process into a sparse, directed, weighted network. New scaling
laws for seismicity are found. For instance, the aftershock decay rate
decreases as 1/t in time up to a correlation time, t[omori]. An estimate from
the data gives t[omori] to be about one year for small magnitude 3 earthquakes,
about 1400 years for the Landers event, and roughly 26,000 years for the
earthquake causing the 2004 Asian tsunami. Our results confirm Kagan's
conjecture that aftershocks can rumble on for centuries.

initiation and dynamics. If crisis brought on by telomere shortening is

test this, we compared a mathematical model in which telomere loss is the rate
