cosmological mass density of HI in the local universe is found to be
Omega_HI=(3.5 +/- 0.4 +/- 0.4) x 10^{-4}. This large homogeneous sample allows
us to test whether the shape of the HIMF depends on local galaxy density. We
find tentative evidence for environmental effects in the sense that the HIMF
becomes steeper toward higher density regions, ranging from alpha ~ -1.2 in the
lowest density environments to alpha ~ -1.5 in the highest density environments
probed by this blind HI survey. This effect appears stronger when densities are
measured on larger scales.

Here, we report the detection of a new X-ray feature coincident with a radio

synchrotron radiation. However, given that the 20 \kms molecular cloud, with
its intense 1.2mm dust emission, lies in the vicinity of SgrA-F, it is possible
that the X-rays could be produced by inverse Compton scattering of far-infrared
photons from dust by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio
synchrotron emission. The production of X-ray emission from ICS allows an
estimate of the magnetic field strength of ~0.08 mG within the nonthermal
filament. This should be an important parameter for any models of the Galactic

observations of the massive X-ray binary system SMC X-1. The system was
observed during both the high and low X-ray states of the roughly 60-day
superorbital period. The continuum spectra during both states are well
represented by a power law with photon index $\alpha$=0.9 and a blackbody of kT
= 0.15keV. The high state spectra are dominated by the continuum and
independent of orbital phase whereas the low state spectra show a strong
orbital dependence as well as line emission from O, Ne, Mg, Fe, and Si. This is
consistent with the states attributed to disk precession: during the high state
X-ray emission is dominated by the compact source which is abrubtly eclipsed
and during the low state the compact object is hidden by the disk and a larger,
less luminous scattering region is responsible for the X-ray emission. A
prominent Ne IX feature places a stringent limit (Log $\xi$ = 2.0-2.5) on the
ionization parameter which constrains the wind dynamics of the system. The Fe
line fluxes are related linearly to the blackbody fluxes indicating that both
originate in the same region or are excited by the same mechanism. There is
evidence for structure in the Fe-line that cannot be fully resolved by the
current observations. The pulse period measured during our observations,
0.7057147$\pm$0.00000027s shows that the uninterrupted spin-up trend of SMC X-1

O(3)+O(2) symmetric Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory, which describes the
competition of two order parameters that are O(3) and O(2) symmetric,
respectively. This study is relevant for the SO(5) theory of high-Tc
superconductors, which predicts the existence of a multicritical point in the
temperature-doping phase diagram, where the antiferromagnetic and
superconducting transition lines meet.
  We investigate whether the O(3)+O(2) symmetry gets effectively enlarged to
O(5) approaching the multicritical point. For this purpose, we study the
stability of the O(5) fixed point. By means of a Monte Carlo simulation, we
show that the O(5) fixed point is unstable with respect to the spin-4 quartic
perturbation with the crossover exponent $\phi_{4,4}=0.180(15)$, in substantial
agreement with recent field-theoretical results. This estimate is much larger
than the one-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimate $\phi_{4,4}=1/26$, which has
often been used in the literature to discuss the multicritical behavior within
the SO(5) theory. Therefore, no symmetry enlargement is generically expected at
the multicritical transition.
  We also perform a five-loop field-theoretical analysis of the
renormalization-group flow. It shows that bicritical systems are not in the
attraction domain of the stable decoupled fixed point. Thus, in these
systems--high-Tc cuprates should belong to this class--the multicritical point
corresponds to a first-order transition.

analogy to the well-known X-ray edge absorption problem. Secondly, the
threshold energy $\omega_0$ - below which no photon is absorbed (above which no

well known that the AS-graph, and in particular its clustering structure, is
influenced by geography.
  We introduce a new model that describes the AS-graph as a directed graph,
with an edge going from the customer to the provider, but also models symmetric
peer-to-peer arrangements, and takes geography into account. We are able to
mathematically analyze its power-law exponent and number of leaves. Beyond the
analysis we have implemented our model as a synthetic network generator we call
GdTang. Experimentation with GdTang shows that the networks it produces are
more realistic than those generated by other network generators, in terms of
its power-law exponent, fractions of customer-provider and symmetric peering
arrangements, and the size of its dense core. We believe that our model is the
first to manifest realistic regional dense cores that have a clear geographic
flavor. Our synthetic networks also exhibit path inflation effects that are
similar to those observed in the real AS graph.

necessary and sufficient conditions the data have to satisfy in order to find a
unitary matrix compatible with them, and this method can be applied to both
quark and lepton CKM matrices. The key condition writes $-1\le\cos\delta\le 1$
where $\delta$ is the phase that encodes the CP violation, and it is obtained
when one describes the CKM matrix in terms of four moduli of its entries. We
use it to reconstruct many approximate unitary matrices from the PDG data, and
by using the double stochasticity property of the unitary matrices we find a
strong dependence of $\sin 2\beta$ on $|U_{ub}|$, that implies also strong
correlations between $|U_{ij}|$ themselves, proving the constraining power of
this approach.

are investigated in this paper. Mesonic coherent states with fixed $G$-parity

that if the X(1860) is a bound state of $(p\bar{p})$, the decay channel ($X\to

criteria for distinguishing the baryonium interpretation for the near-threshold

the following question (in a different, but equivalent language of integrals):
If there exists a linear dependence relation over $\mathbf Q$ between two
convergent $_3F_2$-series with argument 1, with integral parameters, and whose
values are irrational numbers, is this relation a specialisation of one of the
120 Thomae relations? A few years later, Sato answered this question in the
negative, by giving six examples of relations which cannot be explained by
Thomae's relations. We show that Sato's counter-examples can be naturally
embedded into two families of infinitely many $_3F_2$-relations, both
parametrised by three independent parameters. Moreover, we find two more
infinite families of the same nature. The families, which do not seem to have

taking intervals and suitable sublattices. Trim lattices satisfy a weakened
form of modularity. The order complex of a trim lattice is contractible or
homotopic to a sphere; the latter holds exactly if the maximum element of the
lattice is a join of atoms.
  Other than distributive lattices, the main examples of trim lattices are the
Tamari lattices and various generalizations of them. We show that the Cambrian

  Inventiones Mathematicae",,"10.1007/s00222-006-0026-x",,"math.AG math.DG math.KT math.QA",,"  For a finite group G acting on a smooth projective variety X, we construct
two new G-equivariant rings: first the stringy K-theory of X, and second the
stringy cohomology of X. For a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack Y we also construct
a new ring called the full orbifold K-theory of Y. For a global quotient
Y=[X/G], the ring of G-invariants of the stringy K-theory of X is a subalgebra
of the full orbifold K-theory of the the stack Y and is linearly isomorphic to
the ``orbifold K-theory'' of Adem-Ruan (and hence Atiyah-Segal), but carries a
different, ``quantum,'' product, which respects the natural group grading. We
prove there is a ring isomorphism, the stringy Chern character, from stringy
K-theory to stringy cohomology, and a ring homomorphism from full orbifold
K-theory to Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology. These Chern characters satisfy
Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch for etale maps.
  We prove that stringy cohomology is isomorphic to Fantechi and Goettsche's
construction. Since our constructions do not use complex curves, stable maps,
admissible covers, or moduli spaces, our results simplify the definitions of
Fantechi-Goettsche's ring, of Chen-Ruan's orbifold cohomology, and of
Abramovich-Graber-Vistoli's orbifold Chow.
  We conclude by showing that a K-theoretic version of Ruan's Hyper-Kaehler
Resolution Conjecture holds for symmetric products.

contact rates, incubation times, duration of infectious periods, etc. In most

simple means of quantifying sociological and behavioral patterns. Here we apply
several paradigmatic models of epidemics to empirical data on the advent and
spread of Feynman diagrams through the theoretical physics communities of the

test case has the advantage of having been studied historically in great
detail, which allows validation of our results. We estimate the effectiveness

flow between concentric rotating cylinders. This theory has been proposed in
our previous works. In our previous studies, the energy gradient theory was
demonstrated to be applicable for wall-bounded parallel flows. It was found
that the critical value of the energy gradient parameter Kmax at turbulent
transition is about 370-389 for wall-bounded parallel flows (which include
plane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow) below which
no turbulence occurs. In this paper, the detailed derivation for the
calculation of the energy gradient parameter in the flow between concentric
rotating cylinders is provided. The calculated results for the critical
condition of primary instability (with semi-empirical treatment) are found to
be in very good agreement with the experiments in the literature. A possible
mechanism of spiral turbulence generation observed for counter-rotation of two
cylinders can also be explained using the energy gradient theory. The energy
gradient theory can serve to relate the condition of transition in
Taylor-Couette flow to that in plane Couette flow. The latter reasonably
becomes the limiting case of the former when the radii of cylinders tend to
infinity. It is our contention that the energy gradient theory is possibly
fairly universal for analysis of flow instability and turbulent transition, and
is found valid for both pressure and shear driven flows in parallel and
rotating flow configurations.

in a material planar cavity based on the calculation of the vacuum Lorentz
force [C. Raabe and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 71, 013814 (2005)] describes a
(medium) screened Casimir force and, in addition to it, a medium-assisted
force. The latter force also describes the force on the cavity medium. For
dilute media, it implies the atom-mirror interaction of the Casimir-Polder type
at large and of the Coulomb type at small atom-mirror distances of which the
sign is insensitive to the polarizability type (electric or magnetic) of the
atom.

Phys. 122, 154106 (2005)","10.1063/1.1875052",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose and investigate a procedure to measure, at least in principle, a
positive quantum version of the local kinetic energy density. This procedure is
based, under certain idealized limits, on the detection rate of photons emitted
by moving atoms which are excited by a localized laser beam. The same type of
experiment, but in different limits, can also provide other non
positive-definite versions of the kinetic energy density. A connection with
quantum arrival time distributions is discussed.

used for imaging protocols, in which an object field is injected into the
nonlinear medium together with a reference field and an image field is
generated. When the reference field is chaotic, the image field is also chaotic
and does not carry any information about the object. We show that a clear image
of the object be extracted from the chaotic image field by measuring the
spatial intensity correlations between this field and one Fourier component of
the reference. We experimentally verify this imaging protocol in the case of
frequency downconversion.

A 72, 012319 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.012319",,"quant-ph cond-mat.other",,"  We provide an analysis of basic quantum information processing protocols
under the effect of intrinsic non-idealities in cluster states. These
non-idealities are based on the introduction of randomness in the entangling
steps that create the cluster state and are motivated by the unavoidable
imperfections faced in creating entanglement using condensed-matter systems.
Aided by the use of an alternative and very efficient method to construct
cluster state configurations, which relies on the concatenation of fundamental
cluster structures, we address quantum state transfer and various fundamental
gate simulations through noisy cluster states. We find that a winning strategy
to limit the effects of noise, is the management of small clusters processed
via just a few measurements. Our study also reinforces recent ideas related to
the optical implementation of a one-way quantum computer.
