1.4-GHz flux densities above 40 microJy has been imaged using MERLIN+VLA. The
images are amongst the most sensitive yet made at 1.4 GHz, with rms noise
levels of 3.3 microJy/beam in the 0.2-arcsec images. Virtually all the sources
are resolved, with angular sizes in the range 0.2 to 3 arcsec. No additional
sources were detected down to 23 microJy in the central 3 arcmin, indicating
that sources fainter than 40 microJy are heavily resolved with MERLIN and must
have typical angular sizes greater than 0.5 arcsec. Compact radio sources were
used to align the optical data to the ICRF, to <50 mas in the HDF. We find a
statistical association of very faint (2 microJy and above) radio sources with
optically bright HDF galaxies down to about 23 mag. Of the 92 radio sources
above 40 microJy, about 85 percent are identified with galaxies brighter than
about I = 25 mag; the remaining 15 percent are associated with optically faint
systems. We identify several very red, optically faint systems including the
the strongest sub-mm source in the HDF, HDF850.1. 72 percent of the radio
sources are starburst or AGN-type systems; the remainder are unclassified. The
proportion of starburst systems increases with decreasing flux density; below

models. We analyze this ``massive galaxy problem'' with two different types of
hydrodynamic simulations -- Eulerian TVD and SPH -- of a concordance Lambda CDM
universe. We consider two separate but connected aspects of the problem posed
by these extremely red objects (EROs): (1) the mass-scale, and (2) red colors.
We perform spectrophotometric analyses of simulated galaxies in B, z, R, I, Js,
Ks, K filters, and compare their near-IR properties with observations at
redshift z=1-3. We find that the simulated galaxies brighter than the magnitude
limit of K_vega=20 mag have stellar masses Mstar >= 10^{11} Msun/h and a number
density of a few \times 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3} at z~2, in good agreement with the
observed number density in the K20 survey. Therefore, our hydrodynamic
simulations do not exhibit the ``mass-scale problem''. The answer to the
``redness problem'' is less clear because of our poor knowledge of the amount
of dust extinction in EROs and the uncertain fraction of star-forming EROs.
However, our simulations can account for the observed comoving number density
of ~ 1e-4 Mpc^{-3} at z=1-2 if we assume a uniform extinction of E(B-V)=0.4 for
the entire population of simulated galaxies. The critical question of the
existence of a significant population of old, passively evolving massive EROs
should continue to be tested with future hydrodynamic simulations. Upcoming
observations of the thermal emission of dust in 24 micron by the Spitzer Space
Telescope will help to better estimate the dust content of EROs at z=1-3, and
thus to further constrain the star formation history of the Universe, and

hydrogen-deficient post-AGB white dwarfs. To this end, we compute the complete
evolution of an initially 2.7 M_sun star from the zero-age main sequence
through the thermally pulsing and mass-loss phases to the white dwarf stage.
Particular attention is given to the chemical abundance changes during the
whole evolution. A time-dependent scheme for the simultaneous treatment of
abundance changes caused by nuclear reactions, diffusive overshooting, salt
fingers and convection is considered. We employed the double-diffusive
mixing-length theory of convection for fluids with composition gradients
(Grossman & Taam 1996). The study can therefore be considered as a test of its
performance in low-mass stars. Also, time-dependent element diffusion for
multicomponent gases is taken into account during the white dwarf evolution.
The evolutionary stages corresponding to the last helium thermal pulse on the
early white-dwarf cooling branch and the following born-again episode are
carefully explored. Relevant aspects for PG1159 stars and DB white dwarf
evolution are studied in the frame of these new evolutionary models that take
into account the history of the white dwarf progenitor. The scope of the
calculations is extended to the domain of the helium-rich, carbon-contaminated
DQ white dwarfs with the aim of exploring the plausibility of the evolutionary
connection PG1159-DB-DQ. In this regard, the implications for the
double-layered chemical structure in pulsating DB white dwarfs is investigated.
Another aspect of the investigation concerned the consequences of mass-loss
episodes during the PG1159 stage for the chemical stratification of the outer
layer of DB and DQ white dwarfs.

1901, in the optical using the 2m HCT and at low radio frequencies using the
GMRT. The evolution of the nova remnant indicates shock interaction with the
ambient medium, especially in the southwest quadrant. Application of a simple
model for the shock and its evolution to determine the time dependence of the
radius of the shell in the southwest quadrant indicates that the shell is now
expanding into an ambient medium that has a lower density compared to the
density of the ambient medium ahead of the shock in 1987.There are indications
of a recent interaction of the nova remnant with the ambient medium in the
northeast quadrant also. The nova remnant of GK Per is detected at all the
observed radio frequencies and is of similar extent as the optical remnant.
Putting together our radio observations with VLA archival data on GK Per from
1997, we obtain three interesting results: 1. The spectrum above 1.4 GHz
follows a power law with an index -0.7 and below 1.4 GHz follows a power law
with an index ~ -0.85. This could be due to the presence of at least two
populations of electrons dominating the global emission at different
frequencies. 2. We record an annual secular decrease of 2.1% in the flux
density of the nova remnant at 1.4 and 4.9 GHz between 1984 and 1997 which has
left the spectral index unchanged at -0.7. No such decrease is observed in the
flux densities below 1 GHz. 3. We record an increase in the flux density at
0.33 GHz compared to the previous estimate in 1987. We conclude that the
remnant of nova GK Per is similar to supernova remnants and in particular, to
the young supernova remnant Cas A.

for producing the chondrules that are found in meteorites. Gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) provide a large flux of gamma-rays that Compton scatter and create a
charge separation in the gas because the electrons are displaced from the
positive ions. The electric field easily exceeds the breakdown value of ~1 V
m^-1 over distances of order 0.1 AU. The energy in a giant lightning discharge
exceeds a terrestrial lightning flash by a factor of ~10^12. The predicted
post-burst emission of gamma-rays from accretion into the newly formed black
hole or spin-down of the magnetar is sufficiently intense to cause a lightning
storm in the nebula that lasts for days and is more probable than the GRB
because the radiation is beamed into a larger solid angle. The giant outbursts
from nearby soft gamma-ray repeater sources (SGRs) are also capable of causing
giant lightning discharges. The total amount of chondrules produced is in
reasonable agreement with the observations of meteorites. Furthermore in the
case of GRBs most chondrules were produced in a few major melting events by
nearby GRBs and lightning occurred at effectively the same time over the whole
nebula, and provide accurate time markers to the formation of chondrules and
evolution of the solar nebula. This model provides a reasonable explanation for
the delay between the formation of calcium aluminium inclusions (CAIs) and
chondrules.

the warm neutral medium of CHVCs with high sensitivity. The achieved baseline
rms of about 50 mK at the original 2.6 km/s velocity resolution allows us to
search for evidence of ram-pressure interaction with the ambient medium. In
addition, we have obtained spectra along an appropriate axis across each CHVC
with longer integration times and denser angular sampling. These deep slices
with a spectral baseline rms of about 25...35 mK allow us to determine the
column density profile in greater detail as well as the velocity and line width
gradient across each cloud. The most outstanding result of our observations is
the complexity of the HI column density distribution and the line profiles of
the investigated CHVCs. We have found only one cloud with a
spherically-symmetric appearance. Among the remaining clouds we observe
head-tail structures, bow-shock shapes, and objects with irregular shapes.
These complex morphologies in combination with the obtained physical parameters
suggest that ram-pressure interactions with an ambient medium may play a
significant role in shaping some of the CHVCs from our sample. These results
are consistent with a circumgalactic distribution of CHVCs with typical
distances of the order of 100 kpc. The pressure of the ambient medium might
also stabilise CHVCs in addition to their own gravitational potential.

optimization in which a set of $n$ numbers is partitioned into two subsets such
that the sum of the numbers in one subset is as close as possible to the sum of
the numbers in the other set. When the $n$ numbers are i.i.d. variables drawn
from some distribution, the partitioning problem turns out to be equivalent to
a mean-field antiferromagnetic Ising spin glass. In the spin glass
representation, it is natural to define energies -- corresponding to the costs
of the partitions, and overlaps -- corresponding to the correlations between
partitions. Although the energy levels of this model are {\em a priori} highly
correlated, a surprising recent conjecture asserts that the energy spectrum of
number partitioning is locally that of a random energy model (REM): the
spacings between nearby energy levels are uncorrelated. In other words, the
properly scaled energies converge to a Poisson process. The conjecture also
asserts that the corresponding spin configurations are uncorrelated, indicating
vanishing overlaps in the spin glass representation. In this paper, we prove
these two claims, collectively known as the local REM conjecture.

concentrated on ground state properties. However recent spectroscopic
measurements have been used to infer the structure of water, and the
interpretation of optical and x-ray spectra requires accurate theoretical
models of excited electronic states, not only of the ground state. To this end,
we investigate the electronic properties of water at ambient conditions using
ab initio density functional theory within the generalized gradient
approximation (DFT/GGA), focussing on the unoccupied subspace of Kohn-Sham
eigenstates. We generate long (250 ps) classical trajectories for large
supercells, up to 256 molecules, from which uncorrelated configurations of
water molecules are extracted for use in DFT/GGA calculations of the electronic
structure. We find that the density of occupied states of this molecular liquid
is well described with 32 molecule supercells using a single k-point (k = 0) to
approximate integration over the first Brillouin zone. However, the description
of the density of unoccupied states (u-EDOS) is sensitive to finite size
effects. Small, 32 molecule supercell calculations, using Gamma-the point
approximation, yield a spuriously isolated state above the Fermi level.
Nevertheless, the more accurate u-EDOS of large, 256 molecule supercells may be
reproduced using smaller supercells and increased k-point sampling. This
indicates that the electronic structure of molecular liquids like water is
relatively insensitive to the long-range disorder in the molecular structure.
These results have important implications for efficiently increasing the
accuracy of spectral calculations for water and other molecular liquids.

different lattice and scatterer symmetry are studied numerically, with three
types of lattice (square, triangular and rectangular) and four different
scatterer shapes (circle, hexagon, square and rectangle) considered. XY and $Z$
vibration modes are investigated separately. Two types of phononic crystal are
considered: one composed of high-density rods embedded in a low-density matrix,
the other of low-density rods in a high-density matrix. In the former case,
lattice type and polarization being fixed, the broadest gaps are obtained when
the symmetry of the rods corresponds to that of the lattice (the shape of a rod
is identical with that of the first Brillouin zone); the largest gap width
values are observed in triangular lattice-based crystals (compared to those
based on square and rectangular lattices), the shape of the corresponding first
Brillouin zone being closest to a circle. These rules do not apply to
structures in which the density of the rod material is lower than that of the
matrix. In this case, when the symmetry of the rods corresponds to that of the
lattice, gaps either fail to appear at all, or are much narrower than in other
configurations. The effect of other material parameter values (such as the
longitudinal and transversal velocity values) on the considered relation proves
much lesser.

dislocations and disclinations in the framework of Mindlin's gradient
elasticity. We consider simple but rigorous versions of Mindlin's first
gradient elasticity with one material length (gradient coefficient). Using the
stress function method, we find modified stress functions for all six types of
Volterra defects (dislocations and disclinations) situated in an isotropic and
infinitely extended medium. By means of these stress functions, we obtain exact
analytical solutions for the stress and strain fields of dislocations and
disclinations. An advantage of these solutions for the elastic strain and
stress is that they have no singularities at the defect line. They are finite
and have maxima or minima in the defect core region. The stresses and strains
are either zero or have a finite maximum value at the defect line. The maximum
value of stresses may serve as a measure of the critical stress level when
fracture and failure may occur. Thus, both the stress and elastic strain
singularities are removed in such a simple gradient theory. In addition, we
give the relation to the nonlocal stresses in Eringen's nonlocal elasticity for
the nonsingular stresses.

called a ""wet granular material"", is made of non-Brownian particles immersed in
a viscous fluid. The particles are heavier than the fluid, consequently,
gravity influences the structure and flow profiles of the sheared material.
Experiments are carried out in a plane Couette device, with a model slurry
composed of approximately monodisperse spherical PMMA particles in oil, at high
average solid concentration (about 58%). Optical observation reveals a typical
2-phase configuration, with a fluidized layer in contact with the upper plate
and on top of an amorphous solid phase. We provide data on velocity profiles,
wall-slip and shear stress versus the average shear rate. To interpret the
data, we propose a model for the ideal case of infinite horizontal flat plates.
The model, of mean field type, is based on local constitutive equations for the
tangential and normal components of the stress tensor and on expressions
relating the material viscometric coefficients (the shear viscosity eta and the
normal viscosity psi) with the local concentration (phi) and the local shear
rate. 1-,2- and 3-phase configurations are predicted, with non linear flow and
concentration profiles. We conclude that the model equations correctly describe
the experimental data, provided that appropriate forms are chosen for the
divergence of eta and psi near the packing concentration (phi_max), namely a
(phi_max-phi)^-1 singularity.

analogue of this model yields inverse freezing, as implied by the analytic
solution based on the replica trick. The qualitative features of this system
(generalized Blume-Capel spin model) are shown to resemble a large class of

exact rescaling of one of the interaction parameters that measures the entropy
of the system. For the case of almost degenerate spin states perturbative
expansion is presented, and the first three terms correspond to the empiric
formula for the Flory-Huggins $\chi$ parameter in the theory of polymer melts.

broad-band transients (glitches) of instrumental or environmental origin which
can appear with high signal-to-noise ratio on the matched filtering output.
This paper describes several techniques to discriminate genuine events from the
false ones, based on our knowledge of the signals we look for. Starting with
the $\chi^2$ discriminator, we show how it may be optimized for free
parameters. We then introduce several alternative vetoing statistics and
discuss their performance using data from the GEO600 detector.

apply two formulations of the Ginsparg-Wilson fermions the Neuberger operator

main result we present the comparison of the distributions of the leading
individual eigenvalues of the Neuberger operator in QCD and the analytical
predictions of chiral random matrix theory. We observe a good agreement as long
as each side of the physical volume exceeds about $L\approx 1.12\fm$. It turns
out that this bound for $L$ is generic and sets the size of the physical volume
where the axial correlator behaves according to chiral perturbation theory.
This allows us to compute a value for the pion decay constant $F_{\pi}$. As an
alternative procedure we only consider the contribution from the zero modes.
Here we are able to obtain an estimate for $F_{\pi}$ and $\alpha$. As a
theoretical development the L\""uscher topology conserving gauge action is
investigated. This enables us to sample the observables of interest in the
$\epsilon$--regime without recomputing the index. We can report that a
promising gauge action has been identified.

and extra dimension models. New charged and neutral heavy leptons are a feature
of a number of theories of new physics, including the `intermediate scale'
class of supersymmetric models. Using a time-of-flight technique to detect the

D-term models have the desirable property that the inflaton mass can naturally
remain much smaller than the Hubble scale. We observe that this advantage is
lost in models based on string compactifications whose volume is stabilized by
a nonperturbative superpotential: the F-term energy associated with volume
stabilization causes the eta problem to reappear. Moreover, any shift
symmetries introduced to protect the inflaton mass will typically be lifted by
threshold corrections to the volume-stabilizing superpotential. Using threshold
corrections computed by Berg, Haack, and Kors, we illustrate this point in the
example of the D3-D7 inflationary model, and conclude that inflation is
possible, but only for fine-tuned values of the stabilized moduli. More
generally, we conclude that inflationary models in stable string
compactifications, even D-term models with shift symmetries, will require a
certain amount of fine-tuning to avoid this new contribution to the eta
problem.

are examined when the spacetime is a $(4+n)$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m
black hole. Making use of an appropriate analytic continuation, we compute the
absorption and emission spectra in the full range of particle's energy. For the
case of the brane-localized scalar the presence of the nonzero inner horizon
parameter $r_-$ generally enhances the absorptivity and suppresses the emission
rate compared to the case of the Schwarzschild phase. The low-energy absorption
cross section exactly equals to $4\pi r_+^2$, two-dimensional horizon area. The
effect of the extra dimensions generally suppresses the absorptivity and
enhances the emission rate, which results in the disappearance of the
oscillatory pattern in the total absorption cross section when $n$ is large.
For the case of the bulk scalar the effect of $r_-$ on the spectra is similar
to that in the case of the brane-localized scalar. The low-energy absorption
cross section equals to the area of the horizon hypersurface. In the presence
of the extra dimensions the total absorption cross section tends to be inclined
with a positive slope. It turns out that the ratio of the {\it missing} energy
over the {\it visible} one decreases with increase of $r_-$.

understood, yet there remain unsolved problems. In this thesis, superfield
actions for free massless and massive higher spin superfield theories are
formulated in four dimensions. The discussion of massless models is restricted
to half integer superhelicity. These models describe multiplets with helicities
(s, s-1/2) where s is an integer. The investigation of massive models covers
recent work on superspin-3/2 and superspin-1 multiplets. Superspin-3/2
multiplets contain component fields with spins (2, 3/2, 3/2, 1) and superspin-1
multiplets contain component fields with spins (3/2, 1, 1, 1/2). The super
projector method is used to distinguish supersymmetric subspaces. Here, this
method is used to write general superspace actions. The underlying geometrical
structure of superspace actions is elucidated when they are written in terms of
super projectors. This thesis also discusses the connection between
four-dimensional massive theories and five-dimensional massless theories. This
connection is understood in non-supersymmetric field theory but has not been
established in superspace. A future direction of the five-dimensional models
would involve finding an anti-de Sitter supergravity background. In order to
construct this model using the knowledge gained from this thesis, an
understanding of the Casimir operators of four-dimensional anti-de Sitter
superspace would be necessary. These Casimir operators have not yet appeared in
the literature and are presented in this thesis.

links the existence and scaling properties of QEIs to the spectrum of masses.
The upshot is that the existence of a suitable QEI with polynomial scaling is a
sufficient condition for the model to satisfy the Buchholz--Wichmann nuclearity

symplectic mechanics and its quantisation. In coordinates $\{q^i,p_k\}$ the
canonical symplectic two-form is $\omega_0=dq^i\wedge dp_i$. It is well known
in symplectic mechanics {\bf\cite{Souriau,Abraham,Guillemin}} that the
interaction of a charged particle with a magnetic field can be described in a
Hamiltonian formalism without a choice of a potential. This is done by means of
a modified symplectic two-form $\omega=\omega_0-e\F$, where $e$ is the charge
and the (time-independent) magnetic field $\F$ is closed: $\dif\F=0$. With this
symplectic structure, the canonical momentum variables acquire non-vanishing
Poisson brackets: $\{p_k,p_l\} = e F_{kl}(q)$. Similarly a closed two-form in
$p$-space $\G$ may be introduced. Such a {\it dual magnetic field} $\G$
interacts with the particle's {\it dual charge} $r$. A new modified symplectic
two-form $\omega=\omega_0-e\F+r\G$ is then defined. Now, both $p$- and
$q$-variables will cease to Poisson commute and upon quantisation they become
noncommuting operators. In the particular case of a linear phase space ${\bf
R}^{2N}$, it makes sense to consider constant $\F$ and $\G$ fields. It is then
possible to define, by a linear transformation, global Darboux coordinates:
$\{\xi^i,\pi_k\}= {\delta^i}_k$. These can then be quantised in the usual way
$[\hat{\xi}^i,\hat{\pi}_k]=i\hbar {\delta^i}_k$. The case of a quadratic
potential is examined with some detail when $N$ equals 2 and 3.

corresponding ones derived under the standard assumptions of normality and

they allow us to apply classical statistical methods for inference, which use
only first- and second-order moments, to correlated and nonnormal data. Via a

negligible bias and provide less variability than the a.s.e.'s computed by an
alternative robust estimator that utilizes up to fourth moments. Our
methodology and results are applied to real panel data, and it is shown that
the correlated samples cannot be formulated and analyzed as independent

degrees of freedom at hadronization and gluon degrees of freedom are not

consistent with recent Lattice QCD calculations that near the critical
temperature hadrons do not melt completely and quasi-particles may provide an
effective degrees of freedom to describe the partonic matter. Heavy quark

The interaction between the diquark and the quark is taken as an exchange

and temperature dependent based on the lattice QCD and dynamical chiral
symmetry breaking (DCSB). The kernel interaction modification with temperature
is approximated using the mixed representation in the imaginary time formalism

the Matsubara frequencies sum. The results of BSE are compared with those for
MIT bag model. We argue the bag pressure is a temperature dependent and it
decreases smoothly with temperature to be consistent with the results for BSE.
Furthermore, the nucleon bound state obtained by BSE ceases to exist just below
the critical temperature and this indicates that the nucleon deconfines to its
constituent quarks at the critical temperature. The nucleon mass decreases with
temperature as $M_N(T)/M_N(0)\approx {\cal R}^{\delta}(T)$ where ${\cal
R}(T)=(1-b\frac{T^2}{T^2_c})^{1/2}$ and $\delta\approx 1$ and this suggests

that the gauge potentials themselves are unchanged under gauge transformations.

issue of \emph{instrumental realism}, the issue of whether (as for EPR in the
original form or EPRB, Bohm's versions using spin) or not (as for GHZ)
observables have values that preexist measurement. Instrumental realism in the
EPR context helps us prove that in some special circumstances, one can get
simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities, which in particular make
sense together. This shatters the axiomatic presentation of Quantum Mechanics.
This simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities elaborates on 1935 work
by Schr{\""o}dinger, hence the name, \emph{Schr{\""o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem},
given to the second main result that is easily deduced from the result on
instrumental realism. Once the axiomatic edifice of Quantum Mechanics is
broken, we can let go the completeness of the wave function as suggested in
EPR, and hold fast on locality. The EPR paper of mid-1935 gets here contrasted,
from a new point of view, with a 1936 text where Einstein avoids using
counterfactuals. Counterfactuals get a precise definition and the corresponding
concept is used all along, but may be new under an old name. We provide a short
critical review of Bell's 1964 paper. Then, a small modification of arguments
for the Schr{\""o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem will let appear a simple
conservation law, combined with the Malus Law, as the origin of the correlation
in Bell's version of EPRB: this is our third main result. As the fourth main
result, a last use of the concept of counterfactual yields the decay of
geometry at small enough scale. This opens a new world of interpretation of
aspects of Quantum Mechanics, aspects that range from measurement and the need
of classical physics to views on what realism should mean in microphysics.
