elliptical galaxies using initial galaxy models that consist of a dark matter
halo and a stellar bulge with properties consistent with the observed
fundamental plane. By varying the density profile of the dark matter halo
(standard NFW versus adiabatically contracted NFW), the global stellar to dark
matter mass ratio, and the orbit of the merging galaxies, we are able to assess
the impact of each of these factors on the structure of the merger remnant. Our
results indicate that the properties of the remnant bulge depend primarily on
the angular momentum and energy of the orbit; for a cosmologically motivated
orbit, the effective radius and velocity dispersion of the remnant bulge remain
approximately on the fundamental plane. This indicates that the observed
properties of elliptical galaxies are consistent with significant growth via
late dissipationless mergers. We also find that the dark matter fraction within
the effective radius of our remnants increases after the merger, consistent
with the hypothesis that the tilt of the fundamental plane from the virial
theorem is due to a varying dark matter fraction as a function of galaxy mass.

We propose that these modulations are due to distortion of pulsar B
magnetosphere by pulsar A wind which produces orbital phase-dependent changes
of the direction along which radio waves are emitted. In our model, pulsar B is
intrinsically bright at all times but its radiation beam misses the Earth at
most orbital phases. We employ a simple model of distorted B magnetosphere
using stretching transformations of Euler potentials of dipolar fields. To fit
observations we use parameters of pulsar B derived from modeling of A eclipses
(Lyutikov and Thompson 2005). The model reproduces two bright regions
approximately at the observed orbital phases, explains variations of the pulse
shape between them and regular timing residuals within each emission window. It
also makes predictions for timing properties and secular variations of pulsar B

random walker across the barrier. In this paper, we study this first crossing
probability analytically. Complete solutions are obtained for barriers that
vary as square root of time and square of time. Large and small time asymptotic

  In this work, we measure the baryonic mass function of galaxies, which
describes how the baryonic mass is distributed {\it within} galaxies of
different types (e.g. spiral or elliptical) and of different sizes. This can
provide useful constraints on our current cosmology, convolved with our
understanding of how galaxies form. This work relies on various large
astronomical surveys, for example the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (to
observe stars) and the HIPASS radio survey (to observe atomic gas). We then
perform an integral over our mass function to determine the cosmological
density in baryons in galaxies: $\Omega_{\rm b, gal} = 0.0035$. Most of these
baryons are in stars: $\Omega_{*} = 0.0028$. Only about 20% are in gas. The

different methods, is $\sim 10$%; systematic errors may be much larger.
  Most ($\sim 90$%) of the baryons in the Universe are not in galaxies. They

drifts of the oscillations in the bursts, and the burning appears to excite
these waves quite naturally. This paper addresses the detailed shape of the
expected flux profiles from r-modes on neutron stars as a function of energy.
R-modes naturally account for both the small amplitude of the observed
oscillations and their lack of harmonic content. However, the model predicts
that the oscillation at higher energies leads the lower energy variation. The
observed oscillations have the opposite trend which possibly indicates that the
higher energy photons are upscattered in the plasma surrounding the neutron

Godunov algorithm based on the piecewise parabolic method (PPM), the corner
transport upwind (CTU) integration algorithm, and the constrained transport
(CT) algorithm for evolving the magnetic field. This algorithm is particularly
suited for these studies owing to the conservation properties of a Godunov
scheme and the particular implementation of the shearing box source terms used
here. We present a variety of calculations which may be compared directly to
previously published results and discuss them in some detail. The only
significant discrepancy found between the results presented here and in the
published literature involves the turbulent heating rate. We observe the
presence of recurrent channel solutions in calculations involving a mean
vertical magnetic field and the associated time lag between the energy
injection and thermalization rate. We also present the results of a shearing
box calculation which includes an optically thin radiative term with a cooling
rate selected to match the turbulent heating rate. Some properties which we
find uniformly present in all of the calculations presented here are
compressible fluctuations, spiral waves and weak shocks. It is found that these
compressible modes dominate the temporal fluctuations in the probability
distribution functions for most of the thermodynamic variables; only the
specific entropy is relatively immune to their effects.

distribution function containing the information on the distribution of stellar
remnants, the number of supernovae and the chemical enrichment history of a
galaxy. Since most stars form in embedded star clusters with different masses
the IGIMF becomes an integral of the assumed (universal or invariant) stellar
IMF over the embedded star-cluster mass function (ECMF). For a range of
reasonable assumptions about the IMF and the ECMF we find the IGIMF to be
steeper (containing fewer massive stars per star) than the stellar IMF, but
below a few Msol it is invariant and identical to the stellar IMF for all
galaxies. However, the steepening sensitively depends on the form of the ECMF
in the low-mass regime. Furthermore, observations indicate a relation between
the star formation rate of a galaxy and the most massive young stellar cluster
in it. The assumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of a
young-cluster mass function leads to a connection of the star formation rate
and the slope of the IGIMF above a few Msol. The IGIMF varies with the star
formation history of a galaxy. Notably, large variations of the IGIMF are
evident for dE, dIrr and LSB galaxies with a small to modest stellar mass. We
find that for any galaxy the number of supernovae per star (NSNS) is suppressed
relative to that expected for a Salpeter IMF. Dwarf galaxies have a smaller
NSNS compared to massive galaxies. For dwarf galaxies the NSNS varies
substantially depending on the galaxy assembly history and the assumptions made
about the low-mass end of the ECMF. The findings presented here may be of some
consequence for the cosmological evolution of the number of supernovae per
low-mass star and the chemical enrichment of galaxies of different mass.

clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each
of whose length to width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc
candidates were identified with a length to width ratio less than 7. Keck
spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the
radial arc sample from non-lensed objects is ~30-50%. With our catalog, we
explore the practicality of using the number ratio of radial to tangential arcs
as a statistical measure of the slope \beta of the dark matter distribution in
cluster cores (where \rho_{DM}\propto r^{-\beta} at small radii). Despite the
heterogeneous nature of the cluster sample, we demonstrate that this abundance
ratio is fairly constant across various cluster subsamples partitioned
according to X-ray luminosity and optical survey depth. We develop the
necessary formalism to interpret this ratio in the context of two-component
mass models for cluster cores. Although the arc statistics in our survey are
consistent with a range of density profiles -- \beta<~1.6 depending on various
assumptions, we show that one of the prime limiting factors is the distribution
of stellar masses for the brightest cluster galaxies. We discuss the prospects
for improving the observational constraints and thereby providing a reliable
statistical constraint on cluster dark matter profiles on <~100 kpc scales.

Remarkably, all SNeIa with early data (7 in our RTN sample and 10 from other

IR, and some also in SiII 6255A line. High-velocity features may be interpreted
as abundance or density enhancements. Abundance enhancements would imply an
outer region dominated by Si and Ca. Density enhancements may result from the
sweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity SN ejecta. In
this scenario, the high incidence of HVFs suggests that a thick disc and/or a
high-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be the
case in Single Degenerate systems. Large-scale angular fluctuations in the
radial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this could
originate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likely
explosion mechanism. CSM-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,
possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. In some SNe the HVFs are
narrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burned
material.

aligns with the outer disk PA for the T Tauri stars DR Tau and SU Aur and FU

explained if the inner disks of Herbig Ae stars are optically thin, whilst

in the dust density leads to local gas temperature and pressure increases.
Consequently, the relative motion between the gas and the dust is modified. The
subsequent hydrodynamic drag on the dust particles leads to further enhancement
of their concentration. We show that this process is linearly unstable and
leads to the formation of ring-like structures within the estimated life time

smaller masses; they are less restrictive than those from the traditional odd
group approximation regardless of WIMP mass. Combination of experimental

obtained from any single experiment. Experiments traditionally considered

The charges of the black holes are considered to be of two types, the first
being an induced tidal charge that appears as an imprint of nonlocal
gravitational effects from the bulk space and the second is a usual electric
charge arising due to a Maxwell field trapped on the brane. We assume a special
ansatz for the metric on the brane taking it to be of the Kerr-Schild form and
show that the Kerr-Newman solution of ordinary general relativity in which the
electric charge is superceded by a tidal charge satisfies a closed system of
the effective gravitational field equations on the brane. It turns out that the
negative tidal charge may provide a mechanism for spinning up the black hole so
that its rotation parameter exceeds its mass. This is not allowed in the
framework of general relativity. We also find a new solution that represents a
rotating black hole on the brane carrying both charges. We show that for a
rapid enough rotation the combined influence of the rotational dynamics and the
local bulk effects of the ""squared"" energy momentum tensor on the brane distort
the horizon structure of the black hole in such a way that it can be thought of
as composed of non-uniformly rotating null circles with growing radii from the
equatorial plane to the poles. We finally study the geodesic motion of test
particles in the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole with tidal charge.
We show that the effects of negative tidal charge tend to increase the horizon
radius, as well as the radii of the limiting photon orbit, the innermost bound
and the innermost stable circular orbits for both direct and retrograde motions

shrinking monotonically until it disappears at a critical time $T$ and point

corresponding rescaled mean curvature flow converges to a sphere ${\bf S^n}$ of
radius $\sqrt{n}$. In this paper we will study the rate of exponential
convergence of a rescaled flow. We will present here a method that tells us the
rate of the exponential decay is at least $\frac{2}{n}$. We can define the
''arrival time'' $u$ of a smooth, strictly convex $n$-dimensional hypersurface
as it moves with normal velocity equal to its mean curvature as $u(x) = t$, if
$x\in M_t$ for $x\in \Int(M_0)$. Huisken proved that for $n\ge 2$ $u(x)$ is
$C^2$ near $x^*$. The case $n=1$ has been treated by Kohn and Serfaty, they
proved $C^3$ regularity of $u$. As a consequence of obtained rate of
convergence of the mean curvature flow we prove that $u$ is not $C^3$ near

  Network Topologies","Submitted to SIADS",,"10.1137/050625229",,"nlin.CD cond-mat.dis-nn nlin.AO",,"  In previous work, empirical evidence indicated that a time-varying network
could propagate sufficient information to allow synchronization of the
sometimes coupled oscillators, despite an instantaneously disconnected
topology. We prove here that if the network of oscillators synchronizes for the
static time-average of the topology, then the network will synchronize with the
time-varying topology if the time-average is achieved sufficiently fast. Fast
switching, fast on the time-scale of the coupled oscillators, overcomes the
descychnronizing decoherence suggested by disconnected instantaneous networks.
This result agrees in spirit with that of where empirical evidence suggested
that a moving averaged graph Laplacian could be used in the master-stability
function analysis. A new fast switching stability criterion here-in gives
sufficiency of a fast-switching network leading to synchronization. Although
this sufficient condition appears to be very conservative, it provides new
insights about the requirements for synchronization when the network topology
is time-varying. In particular, it can be shown that networks of oscillators
can synchronize even if at every point in time the frozen-time network topology
is insufficiently connected to achieve synchronization.

solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model. To
tackle the formation of a coherent social collective intelligence from
individual behaviors, we discuss several concepts related to self-organization,
stigmergy and social foraging in animals. Then, in a more abstract level we
suggest and stress the role played not only by the environmental media as a
driving force for societal learning, as well as by positive and negative
feedbacks produced by the many interactions among agents. Finally, presenting a
simple model based on the above features, we will address the collective
adaptation of a social community to a cultural (environmental, contextual) or
media informational dynamical landscape, represented here - for the purpose of
different experiments - by several three-dimensional mathematical functions
that suddenly change over time. Results indicate that the collective
intelligence is able to cope and quickly adapt to unforeseen situations even
when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community is requested to

relatively little resolution dependence for the range of grid sizes considered

Tectonics theory, this paper proposes a model where a single cause can explain
all geophysical and geological phenomena. The source of the Earth's activity
lies in the difference of the angular velocities of the mantle and of the solid
inner core. The friction between both spheres infers heat, which is the cause
of the melted iron which constitutes most of the liquid outer core, as well as
the source of the global heat flow. The solid inner core angular velocity is
supposed to remain steady, while the mantle angular velocity depends on
gyroscopic forces (involving acceleration) and slowing down due to external
attractions and, principally the motions of mantle plates 2900 km thick. The
variations of the geomagnetic field are therefore the direct consequence of the
variations of the angular velocity of the mantle relative to that of the inner
core. As a result, the biological and tectonic evolutions during geological
times are due to those phenomena. So, the limits of eras coincide exactly with
the passage to zero of the geomagnetic field. Here we show that cycles of about
230-250 millions years, which exhibit the correlation between the mantle
angular velocity variations, the geomagnetic variations, and therefore the
climate, allow us to predict future events : the current global warming which
parallels the Earth's magnetic field decrease.

by a two-phase learning window similar to that of Spike-Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP). If the presynaptic spike arrives before the desired

directly reflects the time course of an excitatory postsynaptic potential. The

genuine multipartite entanglement, even at finite modest temperatures.

In particular, the optimal search time for this algorithm is proportional to
$\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the database size. This search algorithm can be
implemented using any Hamiltonian with a discrete energy spectrum through
excitation of resonances between an initial and the searched state. This
algorithm is robust and, as in the case of Grover's, it allows for an error
$O(1/\sqrt{N})$ in the determination of the searched state. A discrete time
version of this continuous time search algorithm is built, and the connection
between the search algorithms with discrete and continuous times is
established.

quantum states has attracted much attention. So far, bounds on the optimum
success probability have been derived [1]. For two mixed states they are given
in terms of the fidelity. Here we give tighter bounds as well as necessary and
sufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds. Moreover we
construct the corresponding optimal measurement strategies. With this result,
we provide analytical solutions for unambiguous discrimination of a class of
generic mixed states. This goes beyond known results which are all reducible to
some pure state case. Additionally, we show that examples exist where the
bounds cannot be reached.

particular contribution was to bring quantum mechanics into the discussion and
his ideas played a key role in the development of quantum computation. It was
shown in 1995 by Barenco et al that all quantum computation processes could be
written in terms of local operations and CNOT gates. We show how one of the
most important of all physical systems, the quantized bosonic oscillator, can
be rewritten in precisely those terms and therefore described as a quantum
computational process, exactly in line with Feynman's ideas. We discuss single
particle excitations and coherent states.

two vectors in different orthogonal bases is constant equal to the inverse
$1/\sqrt{d}$, with $d$ the dimension of the finite Hilbert space, are becoming
more and more studied for applications such as quantum tomography and
cryptography, and in relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil
group of quantum optics. Complete sets of MUBs of cardinality $d+1$ have been
derived for prime power dimensions $d=p^m$ using the tools of abstract algebra
(Wootters in 1989, Klappenecker in 2003). Presumably, for non prime dimensions
the cardinality is much less. The bases can be reinterpreted as quantum phase
states, i.e. as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators generalizing those
introduced by Pegg & Barnett in 1989. The MUB states are related to additive
characters of Galois fields (in odd characteristic p) and of Galois rings (in
characteristic 2). Quantum Fourier transforms of the components in vectors of
the bases define a more general class of MUBs with multiplicative characters
and additive ones altogether. We investigate the complementary properties of
the above phase operator with respect to the number operator. We also study the
phase probability distribution and variance for physical states and find them
related to the Gauss sums, which are sums over all elements of the field (or of
the ring) of the product of multiplicative and additive characters. Finally we
relate the concepts of mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement. This
allows to use well studied algebraic concepts as efficient tools in our quest
of minimal uncertainty in quantum information primitives.

  The corresponding geometric phase is interpreted as a holonomy inherited from
the universal connection of a Stiefel U(N)-bundle over a Grassmann manifold.
Most significantly, for an arbitrary initial state, this geometric phase
captures the inherent geometric feature of the state evolution. Moreover, the
geometric phase in the evolution of the eigenspace of an adiabatic action
operator is also addressed, which is elaborated by a pullback U(N)-bundle.
Several intriguing physical examples are illustrated.
