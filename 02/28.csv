polarization anisotropies using observations of anisotropies in the cosmic
21-cm radiation emitted or absorbed by neutral hydrogen atoms at redshifts 10

challenging, a combined study with a relatively low-resolution (but
high-sensitivity) CMB polarization experiment could probe inflationary energy
scales well below the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale of 10^{16} GeV --
constraining models with energy scales below 10^{15} GeV (the detectable limit
derived from CMB observations alone). The ultimate theoretical limit to the
detectable inflationary energy scale via this method may be as low as 3 \times

from the star. Due to poloidal flux entrainment, poloidal field inside the jet
decreases at a slower rate than the dipole's $r^{-3}$, and the pulsar power
increases accordingly: $L\sim (\mu ^2\Omega^4/c^3)(\Omega R/c)^{-\alpha}$,
where $\mu$ is the magnetic dipole, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $R$ is the
neutron star radius, and $\alpha \lesssim 1$ is an index which depends on

poses a challenge to the current theories of planet formation. Based on the
sequential accretion hypothesis and the standard theory of gap formation and
orbital migration, we show that around M dwarf stars, close-in Neptune-mass
ice-giant planets may be relatively common, while close-in Jupiter-mass
gas-giant planets are relatively rare. The mass distribution of close-in
planets generally has two peaks at about Neptune mass and Jupiter mass. The
lower-mass peak takes the maximum frequency for M dwarfs. Around more massive
solar-type stars (G dwarfs), the higher-mass peak is much more pronounced.
These are because planets tend to undergo type II migration after fully
accreting gas around G dwarfs while they tend to migrate faster than gas
accretion around M stars. Close-in Neptune-mass planets may also exist around G
dwarfs, though they tend to be mostly composed of silicates and iron cores and
their frequency is expected to be much smaller than that of Neptune-mass
planets around M dwarfs and that of gas giants around G dwarfs. We also show
that the conditions for planets' migration due to their tidal interaction with
the disk and the stellar-mass dependence in the disk-mass distribution can be
calibrated by the mass distribution of short-period planets around host stars
with various masses.

due to these lines on the level of $0.3 \mu K$ for the H$\alpha$ line, being
maximum at small angular scales ($\ell \approx 870$). The morphology of the
signal is very rich. It leads to relatively narrow spectral features ($\Delta
\nu / \nu \sim 10^{-1}$), with several regions in the power spectrum showing a
characteristic change of sign of the effect as we probe different redshifts or
different multipoles by measuring the power spectrum at different frequencies.
It also has a very peculiar dependence on the multipole scale, connected with
the details of the transfer function at the epoch of scattering. In order to
compute the optical depths for these transitions, we have evolved numerically
the populations of the levels of the hydrogen atom during recombination,
treating simultaneously the evolution of helium. For the hydrogen atom, we
follow each angular momentum state separately, up to the level n=10.
Foregrounds and other frequency dependent contaminants, as Rayleigh scattering,
may be a important limitation for these measurements, although the peculiar
frequency and angular dependences of the effect which we are discussing might
permit to separate it. Detection of this signal using future narrow-band
spectral observations can give information about the details of how the cosmic
recombination proceeds, and how Silk damping operates during recombination.

the inner radio jet, as well as a small-scale, cool component of thermal
emission, a number of the individual galaxies of the host cluster (Abell 2634),
and the hotter thermal emission from the cluster itself. The X-ray detection of
the jet allows us to argue that synchrotron emission may be an important
mechanism in other well-collimated, fast jets, including those of classical
double radio sources. The bases of the radio plumes are not detected in the
X-ray, which supports the model in which these plumes are physically different
from the twin jets of lower-power radio galaxies. The plumes are in fact
spatially coincident with deficits of X-ray emission on large scales, which
argues that they contain little thermal material at the cluster temperature,
although the minimum pressures throughout the source are lower than the
external pressures estimated from the observed thermal emission. Our
observations confirm both spatially and spectrally that a component of dense,
cool gas with a short cooling time is associated with the central galaxy.
However, there is no evidence for the kind of discontinuity in external
properties that would be required in many models of the jet-plume transition in
WATs. Although the WAT jet-plume transition appears likely to be related to the
interface between this central cool component and the hotter intra-cluster
medium, the mechanism for WAT formation remains unclear. We revisit the
question of the bending of WAT plumes, and show that the plumes can be bent by
plausible bulk motions of the intra-cluster medium, or by motion of the host
galaxy with respect to the cluster, as long as the plumes are light.

that the interior of the star is purely hadronic and second that the star can

quark model the critical density for a phase transition to color
superconducting quark matter under neutron star conditions can be low enough
for these phases to occur in compact star configurations with masses below 1.3
M_sun. For a realistic choice of parameters the equation of state (EoS) allows
for 2SC quark matter with a large quark gap ~ 100 MeV for u and d quarks of two
colors that coexists with normal quark matter within a mixed phase in the
hybrid star interior. We argue that, if in the hadronic phase the neutron
pairing gap in 3P_2 channel is larger than few keV and the phases with unpaired
quarks are allowed, the corresponding hybrid stars would cool too fast.
  Even in the case of the essentially suppressed 3P_2 neutron gap if free
quarks occur for M < 1.3 M_sun, as it follows from our EoS, one could not
appropriately describe the neutron star cooling data existing by today.
  It is suggested to discuss a ""2SC+X"" phase, as a possibility to have all
quarks paired in two-flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints, where
the X-gap is of the order of 10 keV - 1 MeV. Density independent gaps do not
allow to fit the cooling data. Only the presence of an X-gap that decreases
with increase of the density could allow to appropriately fit the data in a
similar compact star mass interval to that following from a purely hadronic

springs representing interlocked asperities of the surfaces in contact. Each
spring is given a maximal strain according to a probability distribution. At
their maximal strain the springs break irreversibly. Initially all springs are
assumed to have zero strain, because at static contact local elastic stresses
are expected to relax. Relative tangential motion of the two solids leads to a
loss of coherence of the initial state: The springs get out of phase due to
differences in their sizes. This mechanism alone is shown to lead to a
difference between static and dynamic friction forces already. We find that in
this case the ratio of the static and dynamic coefficients decreases with
increasing relative width of the probability distribution, and has a lower
bound of 1 and an upper bound of 2.

investigation of quantum electrodynamics in two space and one time dimensions
($QED_3$) by Hermele et al. [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 70}, 214437 (2004)]. Utilizing a

renormalization group equation for an internal charge $e$ (the coupling
strength between non-relativistic fermions and U(1) gauge fields) reveals that
the conductivity $\sigma$ of fermions near the Fermi surface plays the same
role as the flavor number $N$ of massless Dirac fermions in $QED_3$. This leads
us to the conclusion that if the conductivity of fermions is sufficiently
large, instanton excitations of U(1) gauge fields can be suppressed owing to
critical fluctuations of the non-relativistic fermions at the charged fixed
point. As a result a critical field theory of non-relativistic fermions
interacting via noncompact U(1) gauge fields is obtained at the charged fixed

The examination has been set in the context of the boson-fermion, negative-U
understanding of HTSC advocated over many years by the author. Stripe models
are developed which are 2q in nature and diagonal in form. For such a geometry
to be compatible with the data rests upon both the spin and charge arrays being
face-centred. Various special doping concentrations are closely looked at, in
particular p = 0.1836 or 9/49, which is associated with the maximization of the
superconducting condensation energy and the termination of the pseudogap
regime. The stripe models are dictated by real space organization of the holes,
whereas the dispersionless checkerboarding is interpreted in terms of
correlation driven collapse of normal Fermi surface behaviour and response
functions. The incommensurate spin diffraction below the resonance energy is
seen as in no way expressing spin-wave physics or Fermi surface nesting, but is
driven by charge and strain (Jahn-Teller) considerations, and it stands
virtually without dispersion. The apparent dispersion comes from the downward
dispersion of the resonance peak, and the growth of a further incoherent
commensurate peak ensuing from the falling level of charge stripe organization
under excitation.

denaturation to the predictions of the Poland-Scheraga model. Concentrating on
the critical region of the latter model we calculate both thermodynamic
quantities and the distribution functions measured in the simulations. We find
that the Poland-Scheraga model yields an excellent fit to the data, provided
(i) we include a (singular) factor weighting the open ends of the doubly
stranded chain, and (ii) we keep the leading corrections to the finite size
scaling limit. The exponent c_1, which governs the end-weighting factor, is
fairly well determined: 0.1 <~ c_1 <~ 0.15. The exponent c, which governs the
length distribution of large loops, is determined only poorly. The data are
compatible with values of c in at least the range 1.9 <~ c <~ 2.2. From the
data it therefore cannot be decided whether the denaturation transition
asymptotically is of first or of second order. We suggest that simulations of
doubly stranded chains closed at both ends might allow for a more precise
determination of c.

field-strength, we show that only complex scalar fields from the $N=2, d=4$
vector multiplet become physical bosons in $d=1$. The rest of the bosonic
components are reduced to auxiliary fields, thus giving rise to the {\bf (2, 8,
6)} supermultiplet in $d=1$. We construct the most general superfields action
for this supermultiplet and demonstrate that it possesses duality symmetry
extended to the fermionic sector of theory. We also explicitly present the
Dirac brackets for the canonical variables and construct the supercharges and
Hamiltonian which form a N=8 super Poincar\`{e} algebra with central charges.
Finally, we discuss the duality transformations which relate the {\bf (2, 8,
6)} supermultiplet with the {\bf (4, 8, 4)} one.

Virtual Haken Conjecture posits that every irreducible 3-manifold with infinite
fundamental group has a finite cover which is Haken. In this paper, we study
random 3-manifolds and their finite covers in an attempt to shed light on this
difficult question. In particular, we consider random Heegaard splittings by
gluing two handlebodies by the result of a random walk in the mapping class
group of a surface. For this model of random 3-manifold, we are able to compute
the probabilities that the resulting manifolds have finite covers of particular
kinds. Our results contrast with the analogous probabilities for groups coming
from random balanced presentations, giving quantitative theorems to the effect
that 3-manifold groups have many more finite quotients than random groups. The
next natural question is whether these covers have positive betti number. For
abelian covers of a fixed type over 3-manifolds of Heegaard genus 2, we show
that the probability of positive betti number is 0.
  In fact, many of these questions boil down to questions about the mapping
class group. We are lead to consider the action of mapping class group of a
surface S on the set of quotients pi_1(S) -> Q. If Q is a simple group, we show
that if the genus of S is large, then this action is very mixing. In
particular, the action factors through the alternating group of each orbit.
This is analogous to Goldman's theorem that the action of the mapping class
group on the SU(2) character variety is ergodic.

distal DNA sites plays a central role in many cellular processes, such as
transcription, recombination, and replication. Here we review the basic
thermodynamic concepts underlying the assembly of macromolecular complexes on
looped DNA and the effects that this process has in the properties of gene
regulation. Beyond the traditional view of DNA looping as a mechanism to
increase the affinity of regulatory molecules for their cognate sites, recent
developments indicate that DNA looping can also lead to the suppression of
cell-to-cell variability, the control of transcriptional noise, and the
activation of cooperative interactions on demand.

the proteomic repertoire. Genetic recoding by editing was so far observed for
only a few mammalian RNAs that are predominantly expressed in nervous tissues.
However, as these editing targets fail to explain the broad and severe
phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice, additional targets for editing by ADARs were
always expected. Using comparative genomics and expressed sequence analysis, we
identified and experimentally verified four additional candidate human
substrates for ADAR-mediated editing: FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2 and IGFBP7.
Additionally, editing of three of these substrates was verified in the mouse
while two of them were validated in chicken. Interestingly, none of these
substrates encodes a receptor protein but two of them are strongly expressed in
the CNS and seem important for proper nervous system function. The editing
pattern observed suggests that some of the affected proteins might have altered
physiological properties leaving the possibility that they can be related to
the phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice.

described as the decoherence due to interaction with a composite bath

causes the slower decay of coherence at larger times. The decoherence rate
scales up as a square root of the number of spins giving the linear scaling of
the resulting error. Our theory is consistent with recent experiment reported
in decoherence of correlated spin clusters.

environment of many spins 1/2 with and without mutual coupling. The total
system is closed, its state is pure and evolves under Schroedinger dynamics.
Nevertheless, the considered spin typically reaches a quasi-stationary
equilibrium state. Here we show that this state depends strongly on the
coupling to the environment on the one hand and on the coupling within the
environmental spins on the other. In particular we focus on spin star and spin
ring-star geometries to investigate the effect of intra-environmental coupling
on the central spin. By changing the spectrum of the environment its effect as
a bath on the central spin is changed also and may even be adjustable to some
degree. We find that the relaxation behavior is related to the distribution of
the energy eigenstates of the total system. For each of these relaxation modes
there is a dual mode for which the resulting subsystem approaches an inverted
state occupation probability (negative temperature).

scheme performs well for both spatially correlated and uncorrelated

given a quite arbitrary pair of quantum chains, one can check whether it is
capable of perfect transfer by only local operations at the ends of the chains,
and the system in the middle being a ""black box"". We argue that unless some
specific symmetries are present in the system, it will be capable of perfect
transfer when used with dual-rail encoding. Therefore our scheme puts minimal
demand not only on the control of the chains when using them, but also on the
design when building them.
