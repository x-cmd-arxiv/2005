interferometry dataset spanning six years with the Palomar Testbed
Interferometer, a smaller amount of data from the Navy Prototype Optical
Interferometer, and a radial velocity dataset spanning 14 years from the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. We have updated the 12 Boo
physical orbit model with our expanded interferometric and radial velocity
datasets. The revised orbit is in good agreement with previous results, and the
physical parameters implied by a combined fit to our visibility and radial
velocity data result in precise component masses and luminosities. In
particular, the orbital parallax of the system is determined to be 27.74 $\pm$
0.15 mas, and masses of the two components are determined to be 1.4160 $\pm$
0.0049 M$_{\sun}$ and 1.3740 $\pm$ 0.0045 M$_{\sun}$, respectively. Based on
theoretical models we can estimate a system age of approximately 3.2 Gyr.
Comparisons with stellar models suggest that the 12 Boo primary may be just
entering the Hertzsprung gap, but that conclusion is highly dependent on
details of the models. Such a dynamic evolutionary state makes the 12 Boo
system a unique and important test for stellar models.

possessing a central optically-thin (dust-free) cavity, ringed by hot dust
emitting at the expected sublimation temperatures (T_sub~1000-1500K).
Furthermore, we find a tight correlation of disk size with source luminosity R
propto L^(1/2) for Ae and late Be systems (valid over more than 2 decades in
luminosity), confirming earlier suggestions based on lower-quality data.
Interestingly, the inferred dust-free inner cavities of the highest luminosity

were simulated using the AIRES code, for the two hadronic interaction models in
current use: QGSJet and Sibyll. Both, photon and hadron primaries were
simulated and used to generate events. The output parameters from the ground
array were simulated for the typical instrumental and environmental conditions

helium, carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium and iron nuclei were also
simulated. We show that Principal Components Analysis alone is enough to
separate individual photon from hadron events, but the same technique cannot be
applied to the classification of hadronic events. The latter requires the use
of a more robust diagnostic. We show that neural networks are potentially
powerful enough to discriminate proton from iron events almost on an
event-by-event basis. However, in the case of a more realistic multi-component
mixture of primary nuclei, only a statistical estimate of the average mass can
be reliably obtained. Although hybrid events are not explicitly simulated, we
show that, whenever hybrid information in the form of $X_{max}$ is introduced
in the training procedure of the neural networks, a considerable improvement
can be achieved in mass discrimination analysis.

dynamics, which is more general and more in line with classical mechanics

inertial frame of reference is no longer required and the inertial force is no

applied in any reference frame as long as which is irrotational with respect to
the absolute background of the universe. The nature of the inertial force is
nothing but the real forces acting on the reference object. The essence of this
reform of classical particle dynamics is just a drawback of traditional
formalism in Newtonian mechanics being corrected. However, it may be more
important that a logical derivation of this new particle dynamics equation
strongly suggests the existence of an absolute background for the whole space
of the universe. In physical concepts, the absolute background for space does
not conflict with the relative length of the base unit of space in Einstein's
Special Relativity and General Relativity. Furthermore, the size of the base
unit of space should essentially be understood as the length of the line

been employed. A key role in this regards is thought to be played by the
continuous transfer of spectral weight from coherent to incoherent states. In
this paper we employ a simple analytical expression for the electronic Green's

synchronization in networks of oscillators coupled symmetrically with uniform

analysis is partially based on the identification of a diffusive process
underlying the communication between oscillators and reveals a striking
relation between this process and the condition for the linear stability of the
synchronized states. We show that, for a given degree distribution, the maximum
synchronizability is achieved when the network of couplings is weighted and
directed, and the overall cost involved in the couplings is minimum. This
enhanced synchronizability is solely determined by the mean degree and does not
depend on the degree distribution and system size. Numerical verification of
the main results is provided for representative classes of small-world and

sphere fluids can be generated by linear truncations of functional expansions
of the nonuniform density rho (r) about that of an appropriately chosen uniform
system. We consider the most general such truncation, which we refer to as the
shifted linear response (SLR) equation, where the density response rho (r) to
an external field phi (r) is expanded to linear order at each r about a
different uniform system with a locally shifted chemical potential. Special
cases include the Percus-Yevick (PY) approximation for nonuniform fluids, with
no shift of the chemical potential, and the hydrostatic linear response (HLR)
equation, where the chemical potential is shifted by the local value of phi (r)
The HLR equation gives exact results for very slowly varying phi (r) and
reduces to the PY approximation for hard core phi (r), where generally accurate
results are found. We try to develop a systematic way of choosing an optimal
local shift in the SLR equation for general phi (r) by requiring that the
predicted rho (r) is insensitive to small variations about the appropriate
local shift, a property that the exact expansion to all orders would obey. The
resulting insensitivity criterion (IC) gives a theory that reduces to the HLR
equation for slowly varying phi (r), and is much more accurate than HLR both
for very narrow slits, where the IC agrees with exact results, and for fields
confined to ``tiny'' regions that can accomodate at most one particle, where

antisymmetric relation such that if (x, y) is an element of A then |x| is
polynomially bounded by |y|), an interval size function of A returns, for each
string x in the universe, the number of strings in the interval between strings
b(x) and t(x) (with respect to A), where b(x) and t(x) are functions that are
polynomial-time computable in the length of x.
  By choosing sets of interval size functions based on feasibility requirements
for their underlying p-orders, we obtain new characterizations of complexity
classes. We prove that the set of all interval size functions whose underlying
p-orders are polynomial-time decidable is exactly #P. We show that the interval
size functions for orders with polynomial-time adjacency checks are closely
related to the class FPSPACE(poly). Indeed, FPSPACE(poly) is exactly the class
of all nonnegative functions that are an interval size function minus a
polynomial-time computable function.
  We study two important functions in relation to interval size functions. The
function #DIV maps each natural number n to the number of nontrivial divisors
of n. We show that #DIV is an interval size function of a polynomial-time
decidable partial p-order with polynomial-time adjacency checks. The function
#MONSAT maps each monotone boolean formula F to the number of satisfying
assignments of F. We show that #MONSAT is an interval size function of a
polynomial-time decidable total p-order with polynomial-time adjacency checks.

describe the leading nonperturbative hadronic contributions to exclusive QCD
reactions at large energy transfer, for instance electromagnetic form factors.
They also enter B decay amplitudes described in QCD factorisation, in
particular nonleptonic two-body decays. Being nonperturbative quantities, DAs
cannot be calculated from first principles, but have to be described by models.
Most models for DAs rely on a fixed order conformal expansion, which is
strictly valid for large factorisation scales, but not always sufficient in
phenomenological applications. We derive models for DAs that are valid to all
orders in the conformal expansion and characterised by a small number of
parameters which are related to experimental observables.

D3-branes at singularities given by complex cones over del Pezzo surfaces (and
related examples), in the presence of fractional branes. From the gauge field
theory viewpoint, we show that D3-branes probing the infrared theory have a
quantum deformed moduli space, given by a complex deformation of the initial
geometry to a simpler one. This implies that for the dual supergravity
viewpoint, the gauge theory strong infrared dynamics smoothes out the naked
singularities of the recently constructed warped throat solutions with 3-form
fluxes, describing the cascading RG flow of the gauge theory. This behavior
thus generalizes the Klebanov-Strassler deformation of the conifold. We
describe several explicit examples, including models with several scales of
strong gauge dynamics. In the regime of widely separated scales, the dual
supergravity solutions should correspond to throats with several radial regions
with different exponential warp factors. These rich throat geometries are
expected to have interesting applications in compactification and model
building. Along our studies, we also construct explicit duality cascades for
gauge theories with irrational R-charges, obtained from D-branes probing
complex cones over dP1 and dP2.

expansion that can be attributed to mirage non-relativistic matter (mirage cold
dark matter) on the brane. The real source of the evolution is an anisotropic
bulk fluid with negative pressure along the extra dimension. We also study the
general problem of exchange of real non-relativistic matter between the brane
and the bulk, and discuss the related mirage effects. Finally, we derive the
brane cosmological evolution within a bulk that contains a global monopole
(hedgehog) configuration. This background induces a mirage curvature term in
the effective Friedmann equation, which can cause a brane Universe with
positive spatial curvature to expand forever.

chain have limits as n tends to infinity. These results can be interpreted as
describing a ``post-gelation'' phase of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent, in

the remaining small blocks are being absorbed.

links added with each new node is an increasing function of network size so the
total number of links increases faster than linearly with network size. In
particular, biological networks can display a quadratic growth in regulator
number with genome size even while remaining sparsely connected. These features
are mutually incompatible in standard treatments of network theory which
typically require that every new network node possesses at least one
connection. To model sparsely connected networks, we generalize existing
approaches and add each new node with a probabilistic number of links to
generate either accelerating, hyper-accelerating, or even decelerating network
statistics in different regimes. Under preferential attachment for example,
slowly accelerating networks display stationary scale-free statistics
relatively independent of network size while more rapidly accelerating networks
display a transition from scale-free to exponential statistics with network
growth. Such transitions explain, for instance, the evolutionary record of
single-celled organisms which display strict size and complexity limits.
