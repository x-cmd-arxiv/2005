is eclipsed once per orbit. We construct a simple geometric model which
successfully reproduces the eclipse light curves, based on the idea that the
radio pulses are attenuated by synchrotron absorption on the closed magnetic
field lines of pulsar B. The model explains most of the properties of the
eclipse: its asymmetric form, the nearly frequency-independent duration, and
the modulation of the brightness of pulsar A at both once and twice the
rotation frequency of pulsar B in different parts of the eclipse. This detailed
agreement confirms the dipolar structure of the star's poloidal magnetic field.
The model makes clear predictions for the degree of linear polarization of the
transmitted radiation.
  The weak frequency dependence of the eclipse duration implies that the
absorbing plasma is relativistic, with a density much larger than the
corotation charge density. Such hot, dense plasma can be effectively stored in
the outer magnetosphere, where cyclotron cooling is slow. The gradual loss of
particles inward through the cooling radius is compensated by an upward flux
driven by a fluctuating component of the current, and by the pumping of
magnetic helicity on the closed field lines. The trapped particles are heated
to relativistic energies by the damping of magnetospheric turbulence and, at a
slower rate, by the absorption of the radio emission of the companion pulsar.

(LMC) microlensing data set that incorporates the effects of contamination of
the microlensing event sample by variable stars. Photometric monitoring of
MACHO LMC microlensing event candidates by the EROS and OGLE groups has
revealed that one of these events is likely to be a variable star, while
additional data has confirmed that many of the other events are very likely to
be microlensing. This additional data on the nature of the MACHO microlensing
candidates is incorporated into a simple likelihood analysis to derive a
probability distribution for the number of MACHO microlens candidates that are
true microlensing events. This analysis shows that 10-12 of the 13 events that
passed the MACHO selection criteria are likely to be microlensing events, with
the other 1-3 being variable stars. This likelihood analysis is also used to
show that the main conclusions of the MACHO LMC analysis are unchanged by the
variable star contamination. The microlensing optical depth toward the LMC is =
1.0 +/- 0.3 * 10^{-7}. If this is due to microlensing by known stellar
populations, plus an additional population of lens objects in the Galactic
halo, then the new halo population would account for 16% of the mass of a
standard Galactic halo. The MACHO detection exceeds the expected background of
2 events expected from ordinary stars in standard models of the Milky Way and
LMC at the 99.98% confidence level. The background prediction is increased to 3
events if maximal disk models are assumed for both the MilkyWay and LMC, but
this model fails to account for the full signal seen by MACHO at the 99.8%
confidence level.

edges can create spectral breaks visible in the spectra of slowly-spinning
black holes viewed from almost all angles and in the spectra of
rapidly-spinning black holes seen approximately pole-on. For fixed mass and
accretion rate relative to Eddington, both the black hole spin and the viewing

when the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes ionized by the first stars
and/or AGN. While the discoveries of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs in
the spectra of the highest redshift QSOs, and large scale polarization of the
CMB, have set the first hard constraints on the EoR, the redshift and process
of reionization, and the nature of the first luminous objects, remain two of
the paramount questions in cosmic structure formation. Moreover, the GP effect
is such that observations of objects during this epoch will be difficult at
wavelengths shorter than about 1 micron. Hence, cosmic reionization, and the
formation of the first luminous objects, occurs in a 'twilight zone',
observable only at radio through near-IR wavelengths. In this talk I explore
studies of the EoR at meter through submillimeter wavelengths. I present recent
observations of the dust, molecular gas, and star formation activity in the
host galaxies of the highest redshift QSOs. These results have interesting
implications on the timescale for metal and dust enrichment, on the possibility
of co-eval formation of SMBHs and galaxies, and on the process of reionization.
I then discuss future capabilities of low frequency radio astronomy to study
the neutral IGM via the HI 21cm line, including imaging and power spectral
analyses of large scale structure in emission, and absorption studies toward
the first radio loud sources. I conclude with a summary of the VLA-VHF system

the flow equations approach. The flow equations approach is known to predict a
definite structure to the observational predictions. In this paper, we first
demonstrate a more efficient implementation of the flow equations exploiting an
analytic solution found by Liddle (2003). We then consider alternative
stochastic methods of generating large numbers of inflation models, with the
aim of testing whether the structures generated by the flow equations are
robust. We find that while typically there remains some concentration of points

groups show remarkable self-similarity in their azimuthally averaged entropy
and temperature profiles. The entropy increases with radius; the behavior of
the entropy profiles is consistent with an increasing broken power law with
inner and outer slope 0.92+0.04-0.05 and 0.42+0.05-0.04 (68% confidence),

entropy distribution in most of the groups is flatter at large radii than in
the inner region, challenging earlier reports as well as theoretical models
predicting large isentropic cores or asymptotic slopes of 1.1 at large radii.
The pressure profiles are consistent with a self-similar decreasing broken
power law in radius; the inner and outer slopes are -0.78+0.04-0.03 and
-1.7+0.1-0.3, respectively. The results suggest that the larger scatter in the

events using a model light curve with the flux blending. We find that ~38% of
the OGLE-II events which appear to have RCG sources are actually due to much
fainter stars blended with a bright companion. We show explicitly that model
fits without blending result in similar tau estimates through partial
cancellation of contributions from higher detection efficiency, underestimated

to biased time-scale distributions and event rates. Consequently, microlensing

to 0.2 dex compared to previous determinations of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).
With these revisions, the photospheric Z/X decreases to 0.0165 (0.0177
Lodders), and Z to ~0.0122 (0.0133 Lodders). A number of papers report that
solar models evolved with standard opacities and diffusion treatment using
these new abundances give poor agreement with helioseismic inferences. Here we
explore evolved solar models with varying diffusion treatments to reduce the
photospheric abundances while keeping the interior abundances about the same as
earlier standard models. While enhanced diffusion improves agreement with some
helioseismic constraints compared to a solar model evolved with the new
abundances using nominal input physics, the required increases in thermal
diffusion rates are unphysically large, and none of the variations tried
restores the good agreement attained using the earlier abundances. A
combination of modest opacity increases, diffusion enhancements, and abundance
increases near the level of the uncertainties, while somewhat contrived,
remains the most physically plausible means to restore agreement with
helioseismology. The case for enhanced diffusion would be improved if the
inferred convection-zone helium abundance could be reduced; we recommend
reconsidering this derivation in light of new equations of state with modified
abundances and other improvements. We also recommend considering, as a last
resort, diluting the convection zone, which contains only 2.5% of the sun's
mass, by accretion of material depleted in these more volatile elements C, N,
O, Ne, & Ar after the sun arrived on the main sequence.

gyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic (~1-10 keV) electrons with
source densities n_e <~ 10^9 cm^-3 in B >~ 10 G magnetic fields. DENIS

coherent emission process in a region of high electron density (n_e ~

dynamics of sources such as Gigahertz Peak Spectrum and Compact Steep Spectrum
radio galaxies, High Redshift Radio Galaxies and radio galaxies in cooling

the clouds. With a small filling factor, the jet retains some forward momentum
but also forms a halo or bubble around the source. At larger filling factors
channels are formed in the cloud distribution through which the jet plasma
flows and a hierarchical structure consisting of nested lobes and an outer
enclosing bubble results. We suggest that the CSS quasar 3C48 is an example of
a low filling factor jet - interstellar medium interaction whilst M87 may be an
example of the higher filling factor type of interaction. Jet disruption occurs
primarily as a result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities driven by turbulence in
the radio cocoon not through direct jet-cloud interactions, although there are
some examples of these. In all radio galaxies whose morphology may be the
result of jet interactions with an inhomogeneous interstellar medium we expect
that the dense clouds will be optically observable as a result of radiative
shocks driven by the pressure of the radio cocoon. We also expect that the

as boundary conditions. We apply Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) method to simulate
the evolution of the star-disk system. We carry out simulations for (1) a disk
inside the corotation radius, in which the disk rotates faster than the star,
and (2) a disk outside the corotation radius, in which the neutron star rotates
faster than the disk. Numerical results indicate that for both models, the
magnetic field lines connecting the disk and the star inflate as they are
twisted by the differential rotation between the disk and the star. When the
twist angle exceeds pi radian, the magnetic field lines expand with speed close
to the light speed. This mechanism can be the origin of relativistic outflows

estimate cosmological parameters by applying the conventional minimizing $\chi

to a combined sample including this GRB sample and an SN Ia sample. Our
analysis shows that: a) in the case of assuming an intrinsic distribution of

not be neglected; b) taking into account this effect would lead to a poorer

the attempt of constraining the cosmological model with current GRB samples,
the results tend to be worse than what previously thought if the mentioned

potential of their host galaxy. Once their density falls below a certain
critical density (which is comparable with the background density of the
galaxy) it is often assumed that their evolution is completed. In fact the
remnant of such a system forms a distribution of stars which are unbound to
each other and which move on similar orbits in their host potential. With this
motivation we study the evolution of an idealised unbound system and follow its
expansion and dissolution in the tidal field of a model galaxy. Initially the
stars are uniformly distributed (with a density below the critical density)
within an ellipsoidal volume. The system itself travels on a circular orbit
within a galaxy modelled as an isothermal sphere. The initial velocities of the
stars are chosen by assuming that they move on (three-dimensional) epicycles
with guiding centre at the centre of the ellipsoid, though the usual epicyclic
theory is altered to account for the self-gravity of the system. This is
believed to be the first exact equilibrium model of a stellar system in a tidal
field. Our main task is to study the stability of such configurations and the
time-scale of their dissolution, as a function of the initial density and size
of the ellipsoid. If the time of dissolution is measured by an increase of the
half-mass radius of 50 %, we find that systems of low density (about 1 % of the
background density) and small radius (50 pc on an orbit of radius 10 kpc) can
survive for about 20 galactic orbits. For small systems we show that the

small c-axis field penetrates in the form of isolated vortex chains. The
structure of a single chain is mainly determined by the ratio of the London
[$\lambda$] and Josephson [$\lambda_{J}$] lengths, $\alpha=
\lambda/\lambda_{J}$. At large $\alpha$ the chain is composed of tilted
vortices [tilted chains] and at small $\alpha$ it consists of a crossing array
of Josephson vortices and pancake stacks [crossing chains]. We studied the
chain structures at intermediate $\alpha$'s and found two types of behavior.
(I) In the range $0.4 < \alpha < 0.5$ a c-axis field first penetrates in the
form of pancake-stack chains located on Josephson vortices. Due to attractive
coupling between deformed stacks, their density jumps from zero to a finite
value. With further increase of the c-axis field the chain structure smoothly
evolves into modulated tilted vortices and then transforms via a second-order
phase transition, into the tilted straight vortices. (II) In the range $0.5 <
\alpha < 0.65$ a c-axis field first penetrates in the form of kinks creating
kinked tilted vortices. With increasing the c-axis field this structure is
replaced via a first-order phase transition by the strongly deformed crossing
chain. This transition is accompanied by a large jump of pancake density.
Further evolution of the chain structure is similar to the higher anisotropy
scenario: it smoothly transforms back into the tilted straight vortices.

between two gold (Au) electrodes. We introduce two new methods borrowed from
Surface Science to (i) confirm the connectivity between the
benzene-dimethane-thiol molecules with the upper Au electrode, and (ii) count
the number of isolated molecular wires in the devices.
  The electrical transport properties of the SAM diodes were studied at
different temperatures via the conductance and differential conductance
spectra. We found that a potential barrier caused by the spatial connectivity
gap between the pentanethiol molecules and the upper Au electrode dominates the
transport properties of the pure pentanethiol SAM diode (r = 0). The transport
properties of molecular diodes with low r-values are dominated by the
conductance of the isolated benzene-dimethane-thiol molecules in the device. We
found that the temperature dependence of the molecular diodes is much weaker
than that of the pure pentanethiol device indicating the importance of the
benzene-dimethane-thiol simultaneous bonding to the two Au electrodes that
facilitate electrical transport. From the differential conductance spectra we
also found that the energy difference, Delta between the Au electrode
Fermi-level and the benzene-dimethane-thiol HOMO (or LUMO) level is ~1.5 eV;
whereas it is ~2.5 eV for the pentanethiol molecule. The weak temperature
dependent transport that we obtained for the SSM diodes reflects the weak
temperature dependence of Delta.

starts from the long-known, but not well-known, fact that the wave function of
the complete system of elctrons and nuclei can be written, without
approximation, as a Born-Oppenheimer-type product of a nuclear wavefunction,
X(R), and an electronic one, Phi_R(r), which depends parametrically on the
nuclear configuration R. From the variational principle we deduce formally
exact equations for Phi_R(r) and X(R). The algebraic structure of the exact
nuclear equation coincides with the corresponding one in the adiabatic
approximation. The electronic equation, however, contains terms not appearing
in the adiabatic case, which couple the electronic and the nuclear

Born-Oppenheimer level. It is proposed that these terms can be incorporated
using an optimized local effective potential.

recently, following the pioneering RG idea by Ma and Dasgupta and the detailed
analysis by Fisher who showed that the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yield asymptotic
exact results if the broadness of the disorder grows indefinitely at large
scales. Here we report these new developments by starting with an introduction
of the main ingredients of the strong disorder RG method. We describe the basic
properties of infinite disorder fixed points, which are realized at critical
points, and of strong disorder fixed points, which control the singular
behaviors in the Griffiths-phases. We then review in detail applications of the
RG method to various disordered models, either (i) quantum models, such as
random spin chains, ladders and higher dimensional spin systems, or (ii)
classical models, such as diffusion in a random potential, equilibrium at low
temperature and coarsening dynamics of classical random spin chains, trap
models, delocalization transition of a random polymer from an interface, driven
lattice gases and reaction diffusion models in the presence of quenched
disorder. For several one-dimensional systems, the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yields
very detailed analytical results, whereas for other, mainly higher dimensional
problems, the RG rules have to be implemented numerically. If available, the

particular quantum networks, the action of the magnetic field or of the Rashba

phenomenon, which relies on both the quantum-mechanical interference and the

implemented via generalized belief propagation. The derived, fully tractable,

answer sets (which is the particular case for R is the empty set), and has its
applications in program optimization, verification, and modular logic
programming. In this paper, we consider more liberal notions of strong
equivalence, in which the actual form of R may be syntactically restricted. On
the one hand, we consider uniform equivalence, where R is a set of facts rather
than a set of rules. This notion, which is well known in the area of deductive
databases, is particularly useful for assessing whether programs P and Q are
equivalent as components of a logic program which is modularly structured. On
the other hand, we consider relativized notions of equivalence, where R ranges
over rules over a fixed alphabet, and thus generalize our results to
relativized notions of strong and uniform equivalence. For all these notions,
we consider disjunctive logic programs in the propositional (ground) case, as
well as some restricted classes, provide semantical characterizations and
analyze the computational complexity. Our results, which naturally extend to
answer set semantics for programs with strong negation, complement the results
on strong equivalence of logic programs and pave the way for optimizations in

perturbative support properties: it smoothly extends to the non-perturbative

the physical endpoint. The calculation of the Sudakov factor, which determines
the shape of the spectrum in the peak region, as well as that of the pole mass,

leading renormalon ambiguity is respected. Furthermore, in computing the

accuracy using the large-order asymptotic behavior of the series, which is

off-Z-pole electroweak corrections arising from the exchange of Kaluza-Klein
modes; this has not been studied in the continuum. The size of these
corrections is summarized by the electroweak parameter alpha delta. In one-site
delocalized Higgsless models with small values of alpha S, we show that the
amount of delocalization is bounded from above, and must be less than 25% at
95% CL. We discuss the relation of these calculations to our previous
calculations in deconstructed Higgsless models, and to models of extended
technicolor. We present numerical results for a four-site model, illustrating
our analytic calculations.

of light neutrino masses, the neutrino mass-squared differences, the neutrino

experimentally allowed ranges of <m>_{\ell_1\ell_2} based on neutrino

stringent upper bound <m>_{\ell_1\ell_2} \lsim 0.14 eV. We then calculate the

searches for the above Delta L = 2 processes. Comparing our calculated rates
with the currently or soon available data, we find that only the

comparable to the current bound. Muon-positron conversion is next in
sensitivity, while the limits of direct searches for the other Delta L = 2

new contributions to the \lv interactions beyond those from three light

coupled heterotic string with G resp.H-flux and gaugino condensation in a

non-perturbative effects changes the Hodge structure of the allowed fluxes in
type IIB significantly. In the heterotic theory it is known that, in contrast
to the potential read off from dimensional reduction, the effective
four-dimensional description demands for consistency a non-vanishing H^{2,1}
component if a H^{3,0} component is already present balancing the condensate.
The H^{2,1} component causes a non-Kahlerness of the underlying geometry whose
moduli space is, however, not well-understood. We show that the occurrence of
H^{2,1} might actually be avoided by using a KKLT-like two-step procedure for
moduli stabilization. Independently of the H^{2,1} issue one-loop corrections
to the gauge couplings were argued to cause a not well-controlled strong
coupling transition. This problem can be avoided as well when the effects of
world-sheet instantons are included. They will also stabilize the Kahler
modulus what was accomplished by H^{2,1} before.

product having certain natural properties. A standard Hilbert module is a
finite multiplicity version of one of these. Standard Hilbert modules occupy a
position analogous to that of free modules of finite rank in commutative
algebra, and their quotients by submodules give rise to universal solutions of
nonlinear relations.
  Essentially all of the basic Hilbert modules that have received attention
over the years are standard - including the Hilbert module of the d-shift, the
Hardy and Bergman modules of the unit ball, modules associated with more
general domains in complex d-space, and those associated with projective
algebraic varieties.
  We address the general problem of determining when a quotient H/M of an
essentially normal standard Hilbert module H is essentially normal. This
problem has been resistant. Our main result is that it can be ""linearized"" in
that the nonlinear relations defining the submodule M can be reduced,
appropriately, to linear relations through an iteration procedure, and we give
a concrete description of linearized quotients.

systems on the circle. (i) We characterize the sequences of asymptotic length
ratios which occur for systems with H\""older continuous derivative. The
sequences of asymptotic length ratios are precisely those given by a positive
H\""older continuous function $s$ (solenoid function) on the Cantor set $C$ of
2-adic integers satisfying a functional equation called the matching condition.
The functional equation for the 2-adic integer Cantor set is
$s(2x+1)=\frac{s(x)}{s(2x)}(1+\frac{1}{s(2x-1)})-1.$ We also present a
one-to-one correspondence between solenoid functions and affine classes of
2-adic quasiperiodic tilings of the real line that are fixed points of the
2-amalgamation operator. (ii) We calculate the precise maximum possible level
of smoothness for a representative of the system, up to diffeomorphic
conjugacy, in terms of the functions $s$ and
$cr(x)=(1+s(x))/(1+(s(x+1))^{-1})$. For example, in the Lipschitz structure on
$C$ determined by $s$, the maximum smoothness is $C^{1+\alpha}$ for
$0<\alpha\le 1$ if, and only if, $s$ is $\alpha$-H\""older continuous. The
maximum smoothness is $C^{2+\alpha}$ for $0<\alpha\le 1$ if, and only if, $cr$
is $(1+\alpha)$-H\""older. A curious connection with Mostow type rigidity is
provided by the fact that $s$ must be constant if it is $\alpha$-H\""older for
$\alpha > 1$.

Poiseuille flow is investigated. Based on the energy gradient theory, we argued
that the transition to turbulence depends on magnitudes of the energy gradient

energy required for turbulence transition is expressed as a function of the
complementary angle to the energy angle which also characterizes the behaviour
of the energy gradient of mean flow. With some mathematical treatments, the
variation of the threshold energy of disturbance versus the Reynolds number is
obtained. Then, it is found for a fixed disturbance frequency that the
normalized amplitude of disturbance is scaled by Re with an exponent of -3/2
for the transition occurrence in a pipe. This value of exponent agrees well
with several recent results reported in the literature. Finally, the mechanism
of transition to turbulence is suggested for different disturbance levels.

been based on the detection of interference between light waves emitted from
the same source. In the present study the elapsed times for single photons to
move from a laser to a photomultiplier tube are measured electronically.
Time-correlated single photon counting detection produces a characteristic
instrument response which has the same shape independent of both the path
length the light travels and the nature of the transparent media through which
it passes. This allows for an accurate calibration of the chronograph by
observing shifts in the location of the instrument response for different
distances traveled by the light. Measurement of the corresponding shift which
occurs when light moves the same distance through air and water then enables an
accurate determination of the ratio of the photon velocities in these two
media. Three different wavelengths of light have been used. In two cases good
agreement is found between the present measured light speeds and those which
can be inferred from existing refractive index measurements in water. The
shortest wavelength studied is too far in the uv to obtain a reliable estimate
on the same basis, and so the ng value (1.463) measured in the present work
awaits independent confirmation. A theoretical discussion of the present
results is undertaken with reference to Newton's original corpuscular theory of
light. It is argued that his failure to predict that light travels more slowly
in water than in air arose from the inadequacy of his mechanical theory rather
than his assumptions about the elementary composition of light.

derive a perturbation expansion for the energy which is free from divergences.
In the continuum limit we turn off the interaction at a distance smaller than a
cut-off distance $a$ to keep the energy finite. We will show that the
macroscopic theory of the Casimir effect with hard boundary conditions is not
well defined because it ignores the finite distance between the atoms, hence is
including infinite self-energy contributions. Nevertheless for disconnected
bodies the latter do not contribute to the force between the bodies. The
Lorentz-Lorenz relation for the dielectric constant that enters the force is
deduced in our microscopic theory without further assumptions.
  The photon Green's function can be calculated from a Dyson type integral
equation. The geometry of the problem only enters in this equation through the
region of integration which is equal to the region occupied by the dielectric.
The integral equation can be solved exactly for various plain and spherical
geometries without using boundary conditions. This clearly shows that the
Casimir force for dielectrics is due to the forces between the atoms.
