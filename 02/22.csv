field-to-field variations in the number density of PNe and the inferred amount
of intracluster light, with some empty fields, some fields dominated by
extended Virgo galaxy halos, and some fields dominated by the true intracluster

binary radio pulsars (MSPs), with numerical simulations that keep into account
the evolution of the companion, of the binary system and of the neutron star.
According to general relativity, when energy is released, the system loses
gravitational mass. Moreover, the neutron star can collapse to a black hole if
its mass exceeds a critical limit, that depends on the equation of state. These
facts have some interesting consequences: 1) In a MSP the mass-energy is lost
with a specific angular momentum that is smaller than the one of the system,
resulting in a positive contribution to the orbital period derivative. If this
contribution is dominant and can be measured, we can extract information about
the moment of inertia of the neutron star, since the energy loss rate depends
on it. Such a measurement can therefore help to put constraints on the equation
of state of ultradense matter. 2) In LMXBs below the bifurcation period (\sim
18 h), the neutron star survives the period gap only if its mass is smaller
than the maximum non-rotating mass when the companion becomes fully convective
and accretion pauses. Therefore short period (P < 2h) millisecond X-ray pulsar
like SAX J1808.4-3658 can be formed only if either a large part of the
accreting matter has been ejected from the system, or the equation of state of
ultradense matter is very stiff. 3) In Low Mass X-ray binaries above the
bifurcation period, the mass-energy loss lowers the mass transfer rate. As side
effect, the inner core of the companion star becomes 1% bigger than in a system
with a non-collapsed primary. Due to this difference, the final orbital period
of the system becomes 20% larger than what is obtained if the mass-energy loss
effect is not taken into account.

\~1000 keV can be well described by thermal Comptonization model with
reflection from the cold disc, while the rest of the spectra are more complex
and require an additional component below 10 keV. We consider a number of
physically realistic models to describe the shape of the E<10 keV excess. The
additional soft component can result from thermal Comptonization by electrons
with a low Compton parameter, or can be a part of a nonthermal, power-law like
emission extending above 1 MeV. We study correlations between parameters
obtained from the spectral fits with different models. We confirm a general
correlation between the photon index $\Gamma$ and the amplitude of reflection
R. We find that simple phenomenological models (like power-law plus Compton
reflection) applied to the narrow band (3--20 keV) data overestimated the
values of R and $\Gamma$, although the simple models did rank correctly the
spectra according to R and $\Gamma$. The dynamic corona model provides a
satisfactory description of the observed correlation, while the hot inner disc
models have problems in reproducing it quantitatively. We do not find
significant correlation between the electron temperature and other spectral
parameters, while the optical depth of the hot medium seems to decrease when
the spectrum becomes softer. It is also shown that spectral parameters are well
correlated with the timing characteristics of the source.

observed gamma-ray bursts spectra. The standard synchrotron shock model assumes
that some fraction of available energy is given instantaneously to the
electrons which are injected at high Lorentz factor. The emitted spectrum in
that case corresponds to the spectrum of cooling electrons, F_\nu ~ \nu^{-1/2},
is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectral slopes.
We show that continuous heating of electrons over the life-time of a source is
needed to produce hard observed spectra. In this model, a prominent peak
develops in the electron distribution at energy which is a strong function of
Thomson optical depth \tau_T of heated electrons (pairs). At \tau_T>1, a
typical electron Lorentz factor \gamma ~ 1-2 and quasi-thermal Comptonization
operates. It produces spectrum peaking at a too high energy. Optical depths
below 10^{-4} would be difficult to imagine in any physical scenario. At \tau_T
=10^{-4}-10^{-2}, \gamma ~ 30-100 and synchrotron self-Compton radiation is the
main emission mechanism. The synchrotron peak should be observed at 10--100 eV,
while the self-absorbed low-energy tail with F_\nu ~ \nu^2 can produce the
prompt optical emission (like in the case of GRB 990123). The first Compton
scattering radiation by nearly monoenergetic electrons peaks in the BATSE
energy band and can be as hard as F_\nu ~ \nu^1 reproducing the hardness of
most of the observed GRB spectra. The second Compton peak should be observed in
the high-energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the 10-100 MeV
emission detected in GRB 941017. A significant electron-positron pair
production reduces the available energy per particle, moving spectral peaks to
lower energies as the burst progresses.

absorption indices (HaA and HaF), as a function of age and metallicity in old
stellar systems. The models are based on the STELIB spectral library, and
defined at resolution of 3 Angstrom FWHM. The indices are found to be highly
sensitive to age variation, with only moderate response to metallicity. For
galaxies uncontaminated by nebular emission, our HaA index is more powerful in
breaking the age/metallicity degeneracy than H-beta or H-gamma_F. Using a
sample of red cluster galaxies carefully selected to exclude objects with
emission, we find a steep decline of HaA with velocity dispersion (slope -0.75
+/- 0.07 Angstrom/dex). The slope can be translated to constraints on age and
metallicity scaling relations, incorporating measurement and model errors. If
the HaA-sigma slope is due only to age, we obtain Age proportional to
sigma^{0.95 +/- 0.12}. Because HaA depends quite weakly on [Fe/H], a
metallicity interpretation would require Fe/H proportional to sigma^1.2 or
steeper. The HaA-sigma slope is consistent with the combined age and
metallicity scaling relations reported by Nelan et al. from classical Lick
indices. The relations obtained by Thomas et al. significantly under-predict
the observed slope. The discrepancy could arise from differences in the sample
compositions.We discuss in detail the effects of emission contamination on the
results, and conclude that these are unlikely to yield the observed behaviour
in the Ha-sigma relations. The steep age--mass relation supports a ""downsizing""
formation scenario: fainter red-sequence galaxies became quiescent at lower
redshifts, z < 0.5. This picture accords with recent observations of truncated
red sequences in clusters at z ~ 0.7.

imbalance between inner and outer torques causes bodies of mass $\ga 0.1$ Earth
masses to lose angular momentum and migrate inward rapidly relative to the
disk; this is known as ``Type I'' migration. However, protoplanets that grow to
gas giant mass, O($10^2) M_\oplus$, open a gap in the disk and are subsequently
constrained to migrate more slowly, locked into the disk's viscous evolution in
what is called ""Type II"" migration. In a young planetary system, both Type I
and Type II bodies likely coexist; if so, differential migration ought to
result in close encounters when the former originate on orbits exterior to the
latter. We investigate the resulting dynamics, using two different numerical
approaches: an N-body code with dissipative forces added to simulate the effect
of the gas disk, and a hybrid code which combines an N-body component with a
1-dimensional viscous disk model, treating planet-disk interactions in a more
self-consistent manner. In both cases, we find that sub-gap-opening bodies have
a high likelihood of being resonantly captured when they encounter a
gap-opening body. A giant planet thus tends to act as a barrier in a
protoplanetary disk, collecting smaller protoplanets outside of its orbit. Such
behavior has two important implications for giant planet formation: First, for
captured protoplanets it mitigates the problem of the migration timescale
becoming shorter than the growth timescale. Secondly, it suggests one path to
forming systems with multiple giant planets: Once the first has formed, it
traps/accretes the future solid core of the second in an exterior mean-motion
resonance, and so on. The most critical step in giant planet formation may thus
be the formation of the very first one.

microwave background is interpreted as variation in the gravitational potential
at the point of emission, due to the emitter being embedded in a region ${\cal
C}$ of over- or under-density spanning the length (or size) scale $\lambda$ on
which the anisotropy is measured. If the Universe is inhomogeneous, however,
similar density contrasts of size $\lambda$ are also located everywhere
surrounding ${\cal C}$. Since they are superposition states of many independent
Fourier modes with no preferred direction, such primordial clumps and voids
should not be configured according to some prescribed spatial pattern. Rather,
they can randomly trade spaces with each other while preserving the
Harrison-Zeldovich character of the matter spectrum. The outcome is an {\it
extra} perturbation of the potential when averaged over length $\lambda$ at the
emitter, and consequently an additional anisotropy on the same scale, which has
apparently been overlooked. Unlike the conventional application of the
Sachs-Wolfe effect to the WMAP observations, this extra effect is {\it not}
scale independent over the $P(k) \sim k$ part of the matter spectrum, but
increases towards smaller lengths, as $\sqrt{k}$. The consequence is a
substantial revision of the currently advertised values of the key cosmological
parameters, {\it unless} one postulates a more rapid decrease in the
gravitational force with distance than that given by the inverse-square law.

explained with galactic substructure of the sort predicted by CDM, but the
strength and uniqueness of that hypothesis needs to be further assessed. A good
way to do that is to use the physical scale associated with the size of the
source quasar, and its dependence on wavelength. We develop an analytic toy
model to study finite source effects in substructure lensing and identify
general principles. We find that image positions and magnifications are
basically independent of source size until the source is large enough to
intersect a substructure caustic. Even sources that are much larger than the
substructure Einstein radius can be perturbed at a detectable level. A
tremendous amount could be learned by comparing image positions and
magnifications at wavelengths that correspond to different source sizes.
  In a separate analysis, we carefully study four observed radio lenses to
determine which of the images are anomalous. In B0712+472, if the flux ratio
anomaly is real it is probably in image C. In B1422+231, the anomaly is in
image A. Interestingly, B2045+265 and B1555+375 both appear to have two
anomalous images. It remains to be seen whether CDM predicts enough
substructure to explain multiple anomalies in multiple lenses. When we join our
modeling results and substructure theory, we obtain lower bounds on the masses
of the substructures responsible for the observed anomalies. The mass bounds
are broadly consistent with expectations for CDM. Perhaps more importantly, we
outline various systematic effects in the mass bounds; poor knowledge of
whether the substructure lies within the main lens galaxy or elsewhere along
the line of sight appears to be the dominant systematic. [Abridged]

source was found to exhibit a new type of variability as preliminarily reported
in Hannikainen et al. (2003). The variability pattern, which we name $\xi$, is
characterized by a pulsing behaviour, consisting of a main pulse and a shorter,
softer, and smaller amplitude precursor pulse, on a timescale of 5 minutes in
the JEM-X 3-35 keV lightcurve. We also present simultaneous RXTE data. From a
study of the individual RXTE/PCA pulse profiles we find that the rising phase
is shorter and harder than the declining phase, which is opposite to what has
been observed in other otherwise similar variability classes in this source.
The position in the colour-colour diagram throughout the revolution corresponds
to State A (Belloni et al. 2000) but not to any previously known variability
class. We separated the INTEGRAL data into two subsets covering the maxima and
minima of the pulses and fitted the resulting two broadband spectra with a
hybrid thermal--non-thermal Comptonization model. The fits show the source to
be in a soft state characterized by a strong disc component below ~6 keV and
Comptonization by both thermal and non-thermal electrons at higher energies.

clump distances revealed intriguing differences that seem to be connected to
the red clump reddening correction. A spatially variable red clump population
in the LMC can explain the deviations, which may have a broader impact on our
understanding of the LMC formation history. For the Small Magellanic Cloud, we
find a complex structure showing patchy distribution scattered within 3.2 kpc

puzzle is why their orbits are highly eccentric, while all planets in our Solar
System are on nearly circular orbits, as expected if they formed by accretion

generate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has been
little observational evidence to support any particular one. Here we report
that the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets around
Upsilon Andromedae (ups And) provides evidence for a close dynamical
interaction with another planet, now lost from the system. The planets started
on nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (ups
And d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. The coupled
evolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in the
eccentricity of the middle planet (ups And c). Indeed, we show that ups And c
periodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 9000 years. Our
analysis shows that strong planet-planet scattering, one of several mechanisms
previously discussed for increasing orbital eccentricities, must have operated
in this system.

interferometers have been operated in wide band in order to benefit from larger
photon rates. We analyze in this paper the biases caused by instrumental and
turbulent effects to $V^2$ estimators for both narrow and wide band cases.
Visibilities are estimated from samples of the interferogram using two
different estimators, $V^{2}_1$ which is the classical sum of the squared
modulus of Fourier components and a new estimator $V^{2}_2$ for which complex
Fourier components are summed prior to taking the square. We present an
approach for systematically evaluating the performance and limits of each
estimator, and to optimizing observing parameters for each. We include the
effects of spectral bandwidth, chromatic dispersion, scan length, and
differential piston. We also establish the expression of the Signal-to-Noise
Ratio of the two estimators with respect to detector and photon noise. The
$V^{2}_1$ estimator is insensitive to dispersion and is always more sensitive
than the $V^{2}_2$ estimator. However, the latter allows to reach better
accuracies when detection is differential piston noise limited. Biases and
noise directly impact the dynamic range of reconstructed images. Very high
dynamic ranges are required for direct exoplanet detection by interferometric
techniques thus requiring estimators to be bias-free or biases to be accurately
calibrated. We discuss which estimator and which conditions are optimum for
astronomical applications especially when high accuracy visibilities are
required. We show that there is no theoretical limit to measuring visibilities
with accuracies as good as $10^{-5}$ which is important in the prospect of
detecting faint exoplanets with interferometers.

from the profile of the whole protoGalaxy minus the contribution of the dark
matter (and a small contribution of the hot gas by which the protoglobular
clouds were bound), we show that the mass distributions around the Galactic
centre of this cold gas and of the Old Halo agree satisfactorily. In order to
demonstrate our hypothesis even more conclusively, we simulate the evolution
with time, up to an age of 15 Gyr, of a putative globular cluster system whose
initial mass distribution in the Galactic halo follows the profile of the cold
protogalactic gas. We show that beyond a galactocentric distance of order 2 to
3 kpc, the initial shape of such a mass density profile is preserved in spite
of the complete destruction of some globular clusters and the partial
evaporation of some others. This result is almost independent of the choice of
the initial mass function for the globular clusters, which is still
ill-determined. The shape of these evolved cluster system mass density profiles
also agree with the presently observed profile of the Old Halo globular cluster
system, thus strengthening our hypothesis. Our result might suggest that the
flattening shown by the Old Halo mass density profile at short distance from

dust particles in the edge-on Beta-Pictoris disc in order to derive an upper
limit on the mass of gas in this system. Our study is motivated by the large
uncertainties on the amount of gas in the Beta-Pictoris disc currently found in
the literature. The dust particles are assumed to originate from a colliding
annulus of planetesimals peaked around 100AU from the central star as proposed
by Augereau et al.(2001). We consider the various gas densities that have been
inferred from independent observing techniques and we discuss their impact on
the dust dynamics and on the disc profile in scattered light along the
midplane. We show that the observed scattered light profile of the disc cannot
be properly reproduced if hydrogen gas number density at 117AU exceeds 10**4
cm**-3. This corresponds to an upper limit on the total gas mass of about 0.4
Mearth assuming the gas density profile inferred by Brandeker et al.(2004) and
thus to a gas to dust mass ratio smaller than 1. Our approach therefore
provides an independent diagnostic for a gas depletion in the Beta-Pictoris
system relative to the dust disc. Such an approach could also be used to
constrain the gas content of recently identified systems like the edge-on disc
around AUmic.

projected velocity distributions in the core and off-core regions separately.
In the projected velocity distribution of all sample clusters we find a
well-defined low-velocity peak, as well as an excess in the number of stars at
larger velocities. The low-velocity peak is accounted for by the random motion
of the single stars, while the high-velocity excess can be attributed to the
large velocity changes produced by a significant fraction of unresolved
binaries in a cluster. We derive kinematic parameters of the single-star
distribution, in particular the projected velocity dispersion. The relatively
large velocity dispersions derived in this work may reflect the non-virialized
state of the clusters. Based on the relative number of high-velocity (binary)
and single stars, we inferred for the sample clusters unresolved binary
fractions in the range $15%-54%$, for both core and off-core regions. The
present results suggest that care must be taken when applying proper-motion
filters to sort out members, especially binaries in a star cluster. This paper
shows that proper motions turn out to be a useful tool for identifying
high-velocity stars as unresolved binary cluster members, and as a consequence,
map and quantify the binary component in colour-magnitude diagrams.

significantly different from the mean values that characterize the kinematics
of stars belonging to the halo, and the thin and the thick disc of the Galaxy.
The high metallicity of the secondary star of the system rules out a halo
origin and indicates that the system probably originated in the Galactic disc.
A statistical analysis of the galactocentric motion revealed that this binary
moves in a highly eccentric ($e\simeq 0.85\pm0.1$) orbit with an inclination of
$\simeq 110^\circ$ to the Galactic plane. The large Galactic space velocity
components strongly support that a high natal kick as a result of a supernova
explosion could have propelled the system into such an orbit from a birth place
in the Galactic disc. The high Li abundance in the secondary, comparable to
that of stars in star forming regions and young stellar clusters like the
Pleiades, may suggest a relatively recent formation of the system. Following
the orbit backwards in time, we found that the system could have been in the
inner regions of the Galactic disc $\sim$100--200 Myr ago. The neutron star
might have formed at that moment. However, we cannot rule out the possibility

archive data from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). The fluxes show considerable variability and a negative
spectral index, thereby confirming that HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio
emitter. The non-thermal radio emission is believed to be due to synchrotron
radiation from relativistic electrons that have been Fermi accelerated in
shocks. For HD 168112, it is not known whether these shocks are due to a
wind-wind collision in a binary system or to the intrinsic instability of the
stellar wind driving mechanism. Assuming HD 168112 to be a single star, our
synchrotron model shows that the velocity jump of the shocks should be very
high, or there should be a very large number of shocks in the wind. Neither of
these is compatible with time-dependent hydrodynamical calculations of O star
winds. If, on the other hand, we assume that HD 168112 is a binary, the high
velocity jump is easily explained by ascribing it to the wind-wind collision.
By further assuming the star to be an eccentric binary, we can explain the
observed radio variability by the colliding-wind region moving in and out of
the region where free-free absorption is important. The radio data presented
here show that the binary has a period between one and two years. By combining
the radio data with X-ray data, we find that the most likely period is about
1.4 yr.

signals and relative switching from the zero-voltage state are used to probe
the internal excitations of the junctions. Our analysis demonstrates that the
modulation of a phase-locked state in an entirely classical Josephson junction
produces oscillations analogous to quantum mechanical Rabi oscillations,

the sample has the same structure as $2H-TaS_2$. A series of crystals with
different superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$) ranging from 2.5 K to
4.4 K were obtained. It is found that the $T_c$ rises with the increase of $Na$
content determined by Energy-Dispersive x-ray microanalysis(EDX) of Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM) on these crystals. Compared with the resistivity
curve of un-intercalated sample $2H-TaS_2$ ($T_c$ = 0.8 K, $T_{CDW} \approx$ 70
K), no signal of charge density wave (CDW) was observed in samples
$Na_{0.1}TaS_2$ and $Na_{0.05}TaS_2$. However, in some samples with lower
$T_c$, the CDW appears again at about 65 K. Comparison between the anisotropic
resistivity indicates that the anisotropy becomes smaller in samples with more
$Na$ intercalation (albeit a weak semiconducting behavior along c-axis) and
thus higher $T_c$. It is thus concluded that there is a competition between the
superconductivity and the CDW. With the increase of sodium content, the rise of
$T_c$ in $Na_xTaS_2$ is caused mainly by the suppression to the CDW in
$2H-TaS_2$, and the conventional rigid band model for layered dichalcogenide
may be inadequate to explain the changes induced by the slight intercalation of
sodium in $2H-TaS_2$.

detail a mechanism that shows the formation of a discrete speech code without
pre-supposing the existence of linguistic capacities or of coordinated

self-organizing properties of a generic coupling between perception and

phenomenologically and it should be stressed that most of the theorems

before than the compactification process settled down and ordinary

truncations/approximations have been made) can be algebraically (i.e., exactly)
decomposed as the sum of the two principally different terms. The first term is
the Laurent expansion in integer powers of severe (i.e., more singular than
$1/q^2$) infrared singularities accompanied by the corresponding powers of the
mass gap and multiplied by the corresponding residues. The standard second term
is always as much singular as $1/q^2$ and otherwise remaining undetermined.
Here it is explicitly shown that the infrared renormalization of the mass gap
only is needed to render theory free of all severe infrared singularities in
the gluon sector. Moreover, this leads to the gluon confinement criterion in a
gauge-invariant way. As a result of the infrared renormalization of the mass
gap in the initial Laurent expansion, that is dimensionally regularized, the
simplest severe infrared singularity $(q^2)^{-2}$ survives only. It is
multiplied by the mass gap squared, which is the scale responsible for the
large scale structure of the true QCD vacuum. The $\delta$-type regularization
of the simplest severe infrared singularity (and its generalization for the
multi-loop skeleton integrals) is provided by the dimensional regularization
method correctly implemented into the theory of distributions. This makes it
possible to formulate exactly and explicitly the full gluon propagator (up to
its unimportant perturbative part).

accretes into a black hole just like a pressure-less dust. Correspondingly, if
the energy density of the ghost condensate at large distance is set to an
extremely small value by cosmic expansion then the late-time accretion rate of
the ghost condensate should be negligible. The accretion rate remains very
small even if effects of higher derivative terms are taken into account,
provided that the black hole is sufficiently large. It is also discussed how to
reconcile the black hole accretion with the possibility that the ghost
condensate might behave like dark matter.

(iii) (phantom) tachyon. We find the existence of scalar-field dominant fixed
points ($\Omega_\vp=1$) with an accelerated expansion in all models
irrespective of the presence of the coupling $Q$ between dark energy and dark
matter. These fixed points are always classically stable for a phantom field,
implying that the universe is eventually dominated by the energy density of a
scalar field if phantom is responsible for dark energy. When the equation of
state $w_\vp$ for the field $\vp$ is larger than -1, we find that scaling
solutions are stable if the scalar-field dominant solution is unstable, and
vice versa. Therefore in this case the final attractor is either a scaling
solution with constant $\Omega_\vp$ satisfying $0<\Omega_\vp<1$ or a
scalar-field dominant solution with $\Omega_\vp=1$.

dimensions, which could provide a firm ground for constructing a quantum theory
of the gravitational field. The starting point is a gravitational action which
generalizes the Einstein theory for dimensions D>4 --Lovelock gravity. It is
then shown that in odd dimensions there is a particular choice of the arbitrary
parameters of the action that makes the theory gauge invariant under the
(anti-)de Sitter or the Poincare groups. The resulting lagrangian is a
Chern-Simons form for a connection of the corresponding gauge groups and the
vielbein and the spin connection are parts of this connection field. These
theories also admit a natural supersymmetric extension for all odd D where the
local supersymmetry algebra closes off-shell and without a need for auxiliary
fields. No analogous construction is available in even dimensions. A cursory
discussion of the unexpected dynamical features of these theories and a number
of open problems are also presented.

variables describing the non-inertial frames: {\it they are considered as
c-number generalized times}. We study the coupled Schroedinger-like equations
produced by the first class constraints and we show that there is {\it a
physical scalar product independent both from time and generalized times and a
unitary evolution}. Since a path in the space of the generalized times defines
a non-rigid non-inertial frame, we can find the associated self-adjoint
effective Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{ni}$ for the non-inertial evolution: it differs
from the inertial energy operator for the presence of inertial potentials and
turns out to be {\it frame-dependent} like the energy density in general
relativity. After a separation of the relativistic center of mass from the
relative variables by means of a recently developed relativistic kinematics,
inside $\hat{H}_{ni}$ we can identify the self-adjoint relative energy operator
(the invariant mass) ${\hat{\cal M}}$ corresponding to the inertial energy and
producing the same levels for the spectra of atoms as in inertial frames.
Instead the (in general time-dependent) effective Hamiltonian is responsible
for the interferometric effects signalling the non-inertiality of the frame but
is not interpretable as an energy like in the case of time-dependent c-number
external electro-magnetic fields.

theoretically for uniaxial and centered (aster-like) arrangements of

Mutual exclusion of motors from binding sites of the filaments is taken into
account. For small overall motor concentration, the density profiles are
exponential and algebraic in uniaxial and centered filament systems,
respectively. For uniaxial systems, exclusion leads to the coexistence of
regions of high and low densities of bound motors corresponding to motor
traffic jams, which grow upon increasing the overall motor concentration. These
jams are insensitive to the motor behavior at the end of the filament. In
centered systems, traffic jams remain small and an increase in the motor
concentration leads to a flattening of the profile, if the motors move inwards,
and to the build-up of a concentration maximum in the center of the aster if
motors move outwards. In addition to motors density patterns, we also determine

comparing this behavior with the better known case of electrical coupling
arising via gap junctions. In particular, our numerical simulations show that
chemical synapses are more efficient than gap junctions in enhancing coherence
at an optimal noise (what is known as array-enhanced coherence resonance): in
the case of (nonlinear) chemical coupling, we observe a substantial increase in
the stochastic coherence of the system, in comparison with (linear) electrical
coupling. We interpret this qualitative difference between both types of
coupling as arising from the fact that chemical synapses only act while the
presynaptic neuron is spiking, whereas gap junctions connect the voltage of the
two neurons at all times. This leads in the electrical coupling case to larger
correlations during interspike time intervals which are detrimental to the
array-enhanced coherence effect. Finally, we report on the existence of a
system-size coherence resonance in this locally coupled system, exhibited by
the average membrane potential of the array.

explained because of the ``critical'' character of the free case $u(x) = 0$, in
the sense that any atractive potential forms at least a bound state. We believe
this method is more general and direct than the usual one in which one proves
the theorem first for single wave modes and performs analytical continuation.

atomic samples and off-resonant light pulses allow us to store quantum
information corresponding to a single harmonic oscillator (mode) in one
multiatomic system. We discuss the possibility to involve several coherences of
each atom so that the atomic sample can store information contained in several
quantum modes. This is achieved by the coupling of different magnetic sublevels
of the relevant hyperfine level by additional Raman pulses. This technique
allows us to design not only the quantum non-demolition coupling, but also beam
splitterlike and two-mode squeezerlike interactions between light and
collective atomic spin.
