that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly rounder
than halos formed in dissipationless $N$-body simulations. The increase in

remains significant at large radii. Second, we discuss the CDM substructure

Simple arguments regarding common-envelope evolution suggest that these
binaries should have orbital periods less than 10 hr and an average lifetime of
<~10^8 yr before coalescence due to the emission of gravitational radiation. We
expect that fewer than ~10 of these compact, relativistic binaries currently
reside in the Galactic disk, less than 0.1--1% of the number of double neutron
stars. The discovery of two or more black-hole/recycled-pulsar binaries using

The H$_2$ image shows molecular emission from shocked gas, implying the
presence of multiple star formation and associated outflow activity. We see
evidence for several collimated outflows. The most extended jet is at least
0.25 pc in length and has a collimation factor of $\sim$ 10, which may be
associated with a binary system within the central cluster, resolved for the
first time here. This outflow is found to be episodic; probably occurring or
getting enhanced during the periastron passage of the binary. We also find that
the variable star in the vicinity of the outflow source, which was known as a
FU Ori type star, is probably not a FU Ori object. However, it does drive a
spectacular outflow and the variability is likely to be related to accretion,
when large clouds of gas and dust spiral in towards the central source. Many
other convincing accretion-outflow systems and YSO candidates are discovered in
the field.

properties of the flow at early times, when the flow deviates significantly

independent and identically distributed noise, $\omega $, $GARCH$ involves
another parameter, $c$, such that, for $c=0$, the standard $ARCH$ process is
reproduced. In this manuscript we use a generalised noise following a
distribution characterised by an index $q_{n}$, such that $q_{n}=1$ recovers
the Gaussian distribution. Matching low statistical moments of $GARCH$
distribution for returns with a $q$-Gaussian distribution obtained through
maximising the entropy $S_{q}=\frac{1-\sum_{i}p_{i}^{q}}{q-1}$, basis of
nonextensive statistical mechanics, we obtain a sole analytical connection
between $q$ and $(b,c,q_{n}) $ which turns out to be remarkably good when
compared with computational simulations. With this result we also derive an
analytical approximation for the stationary distribution for the (squared)
volatility. Using a generalised Kullback-Leibler relative entropy form based on
$S_{q}$, we also analyse the degree of dependence between successive returns,
$z_{t}$ and $z_{t+1}$, of GARCH(1,1) processes. This degree of dependence is
quantified by an entropic index, $q^{op}$. Our analysis points the existence of
a unique relation between the three entropic indexes $q^{op}$, $q$ and $q_{n}$

search, and can be solved using predecessor search. However, for a RAM with
w-bit words, we show how to perform updates in O(lg w) time and answer queries
in O(lglg w) time. The update time is identical to the van Emde Boas structure,
but the query time is exponentially faster. Existing lower bounds show that
achieving our query time for predecessor search requires doubly-exponentially
slower updates. We present some arguments supporting the conjecture that our
solution is optimal.
  Our solution is based on a new and interesting recursion idea which is ""more
extreme"" that the van Emde Boas recursion. Whereas van Emde Boas uses a simple
recursion (repeated halving) on each path in a trie, we use a nontrivial, van
Emde Boas-like recursion on every such path. Despite this, our algorithm is
quite clean when seen from the right angle. To achieve linear space for our
data structure, we solve a problem which is of independent interest. We develop
the first scheme for dynamic perfect hashing requiring sublinear space. This
gives a dynamic Bloomier filter (an approximate storage scheme for sparse
vectors) which uses low space. We strengthen previous lower bounds to show that
these results are optimal.

${\tilde g}^\prime_{u,d}$ on the value of $Y_t$ in the vicinity of the Landau

the requirement of a low upper bound on $\tan\beta$.

spectrum observed in electron antineutrino mass measurements. It reveals a
half-year variation. The nature of the anomaly can be accounted for by
interaction of negative DArk Electric Matter Objects - daemons detected by us
with the Nb-containing superconducting coils of the gaseous tritium source of
the setup. In crossing the system, the daemons, whose flux varies with a
half-year period, drag away Nb-containing clusters and excite their nuclei and
electronic shells to produce emission of five Auger electron lines within E =
18566-18572 eV. This yields an estimate for the daemon flux ~10-7-10-6 cm-2s-1.
It is shown that in the KATRIN system (KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment)
presently under construction the ratio of the daemon-stimulated Auger bump
signal to the useful beta-signal should be larger than that in the Troitsk
experiment. The potential of using slightly modified systems at Troitsk and
Karlsruhe to study the daemons is pointed out.

describes the physical world as we know it. Recently it was applied to a 2T
re-formulation of the d=4 twistor superstring, which was suggested by Witten as
an efficient approach for computations of physical processes in the maximally
supersymmetric N=4 Yang-Mills field theory in four dimensions. The 2T formalism
provides a six dimensional view of this theory and suggests the existence of
other d=4 dual forms of the same theory. Furthermore the 2T approach led to the
first formulation of a twistor superstring in d=10 appropriate for AdS{5}xS{5}
backgrounds, and a twistor superstring in d=6 related to the little understood
superconformal theory in d=6. The proper generalization of twistors to higher
dimensions is an essential ingredient which is provided naturally by
2T-physics. These developments are summarized in this lecture.

investigated. In the context of the low energy string effective action,
solutions can be found where the spatial part of the background geometry is the
direct product of two maximally symmetric Euclidean manifolds whose related
scale factors evolve at a dual rate so that the expanding dimensions first
accelerate and then decelerate while the internal dimensions always contract.
After introducing the perturbative treatment of the inhomogeneities, a class of
five-dimensional geometries is discussed in detail. Quasi-normal modes of the
system are derived and the numerical solution for the evolution of the metric
inhomogeneities shows that the fluctuations of the internal dimensions provide
a term that can be interpreted, in analogy with the well-known four-dimensional
situation, as a non-adiabatic pressure density variation. Implications of this
result are discussed with particular attention to string cosmological
scenarios.

procedure can be used to study the complete time evolution and spatial

the moveable detector/counter used to obtain the fringe distribution by
counting single photons at different positions on the screen plane is replaced
with a mirror positioned at an angle to the screen plane. A single photon
arriving at the mirror through one of the slits is reflected at one of two
angles along one of two divergent paths. It is then detected by one of two
detectors, one on each of the paths, for different positions of the mirror on
the screen plane. This modification results in the ability to generate which
way information based on the path taken by the reflected photon as well as the
distribution of photon counts on the screen plane, one for each slit. Since the
photon does not experience any change other than the reflection at the mirror
the question whether fringes are also present because of a priori interference
effects when no mirror is present can be answered by examining the two a
posteriori distributions. Three possible outcomes are considered and
explanations proposed for them. The experiment is shown to be feasible with
existing technology and can be performed in most physics laboratories.
