to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities. In this
paper we concentrate on neutron stars, which show thermal (photospheric) X-ray
emission and have measured distances. After a short summary of the radio
pulsars falling into this category we review the observational data of the 7
radio quiet isolated neutron stars discovered by ROSAT which have been studied
in detail by Chandra, XMM-Newton and optical observations. Their spectra show
blackbody temperatures between 0.5 and 1 million Kelvin and an optical excess
of a factor of 5-10 over the extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum. Four of these
sources show periodicities between 3.45 and 11.37 s, indicating slow rotation.
The pulsed fractions are small, between 6 and 18 %. The magnetic fields derived
from spin down and/or possible proton cyclotron lines are of the order
10$^{13}-10^{14}$ G. We then discuss RX J1856.5-3754 in detail and suggest that
the remarkable absence of any line features in its X-ray spectrum is due to
effects of strong magnetic fields ($\sim 10^{13}$ G). Assuming blackbody
emission to fit the optical and X-ray spectrum we derive a conservative lower
limit of the ``apparent'' neutron star radius of 16.5 km $\times$ (d/117 pc).
This corresponds to the radius for the ``true'' radius of 14 km for a 1.4
M$_{\odot}$ neutron star, indicating a stiff equation of state at high
densities. A comparison of the result with mass-radius relations shows that in
this case a quark star or a neutron star with a quark matter core can be ruled
out with high confidence.

which boosts the entropy in cluster and group gas. Since both of these problems
involve an unknown source of heating it is tempting to identify them with the
same process, particular since AGN heating is observed to be operating at some
level in a sample of well-observed ``cooling flow'' clusters. Here we show,
using numerical simulations of cluster formation, that much of the gas ending
up in clusters cools at high redshift and so the heating is also needed at
high-redshift, well before the cluster forms. This indicates that the same

revealed a surprising number of early-type components with significant IR

look at the current statistics of active nuclei in mixed pairs using the
FIR-radio continuum correlation as a diagnostic. We find a clear excess of
early-type components with radio continuum emission and an active nucleus. We
suggest that they arise more often in mixed pairs via cross fueling of gas from
the spiral companion. This fuel is more efficiently channeled into the nucleus
of the slow rotating receptor. In a sample of 112 mixed-morphology pairs from
the Karachentsev catalog we find that about 25-30% of detected mixed pairs show
a displacement from the radio-FIR relation defined by normal star forming
galaxies. The latter objects show excess radio continuum emission while others
extend the relation to unusually high radio and FIR flux levels. Many of the

intense radiation fields into their surroundings. Here, we consider the
possible effects of these powerful explosions on the structure of the accretion
disk. The goal is to account for the apparent evolution of the innermost
regions of the accretion disk around 4U 1820-30 during a superburst. Three
different processes are considered in detail: radiatively or thermally driven
outflows, inflow due to Poynting-Robertson drag, and a structural change to the
disk by X-ray heating. Radiatively driven winds with large column densities can
be launched from the inner disk, but only for L/L_{Edd} >~ 1, which is expected
to be obtained only at the onset of the burst. Furthermore, the predicted mass
outflow rate is less than the accretion rate in 4U 1820-30. Estimates of the
Poynting-Robertson or radiative drag timescale shows that it is a very
efficient means of removing angular momentum from the gas. However, the
analytical results are likely only applicable at the innermost edge of the
disk. X-ray heating gives a change in the disk scale height that is correlated
with the blackbody temperature, as seen in the evolution during the 4U 1820-30
superburst. If this change in the scale height can alter the surface density,
then the viscous time (with \alpha ~ 0.03-0.2) is the closest match to the 4U
1820-30 results. We expect, however, that all three processes are likely
ongoing when an accretion disk is subject to a sudden heating event.
Ultimately, a numerical simulation of a disk around a bursting neutron star is
required to determine the exact response of the disk. Magnetic truncation of
the accretion flow is also considered and applied to the 4U 1820-30 X-ray
reflection results.

outstanding pre-starburst phase. Either pre-starburst gas shocks are too
short-lived to be detected or one has to modify our perception of colliding
galaxies. A dedicated analysis of ISOCAM-CVF mid-infrared spectral maps led us
to the discovery of exceptional H_2 v=0-0 S(3) lambda = 9.66 um line emission
from the ""Antennae"" galaxy pair, which is at an early stage of galaxy
collision. Its H_2 line luminosity, normalized by the far-infrared luminosity,

typical Virgo elliptical galaxy. However, ages derived from Lick indices are
consistent with uniformly old mean ages for all GCs in our sample. The

The most metal-poor and metal-rich peaks are consistent with the values
expected for an elliptical galaxy of this luminosity, but there appears to be
an additional, intermediate-metallicity peak lying between them. New Hubble

identified in cosmological calculations is invariant under the dynamics induced
by sinking substructure satellites -- the background expands so as to leave the
total distribution unchanged. We use a Fokker-Planck formulation to show that
this is the case. The solutions obtained are valid for any mass spectrum of
substructure, because the governing equation is linear in their mass weighed
phase space distribution. If the clumps are considered solid, an exchange of
poulations takes the form of an exponential instability, with characteristic
timescale of the order of the dynamical friction time, leading to a low energy
cutoff in the distribution function of the background and a constant density
core. We show that there are long lived solutions with such a cutoff. They
approximate a situation whereas the clumps are made of dense baryonic material.
When stripping is important, as in the case of dissipationless substructure, it
is likely that this situation is reversed -- the cutoff is now in the clump
distribution function. A simple description suggests that this renders
equilibria even more long lived. The results of this paper suggest that halo
profiles similar to those found in dissipationless cosmological simulations are
approximately invariant under the interaction induced by the presence of
substructure satellites -- a necessary condition for the observed
`universality'. In addition, the total profile, including baryons, should also
be invariant; provided the latter are initially in the form of dense clumps,
whose distribution follows that of the dark matter.

after the peak depends weakly on the initial conditions of the ejecta and
therefore it can be used as an identifiable signature of a reverse shock
emission. On the other hand, the emission before the optical peak is highly
sensitive to the initial conditions and therefore can be used to investigate
the initial hydrodynamic profile of the ejecta. In particular, if the prompt

electromagnetic fluctuations is developed by using the fundamental
Newton-Lorentz equation. Although not based on the same approach, the recently
presented nonlinear guiding center (NLGC) theory is recovered as a special
case. The approach used here is rather based on the argument that a well
defined particle gyromotion does not exist in strong fluctuations than on the
assumption that the particle gyrocenter follows magnetic field lines which
themselves separate diffusively. The assumption of a guiding center motion and
the diffusive separation of magnetic field lines is absolutely central to the
NLGC theory. It is argued that the NLGC result should provide most accurate
results for strong fluctuations. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of the
particle equation of motion, it is shown that particle diffusion in one
perpendicular direction is governed by the fluctuations in the other normal
direction. This results contradicts the NLGC result, where perpendicular
diffusion is triggered by fluctuations in the same direction. This is of
particular interest for anisotropic perpendicular diffusion in a
non-axisymmetric turbulence. Future numerical simulation results for
non-axisymmetric magnetic turbulence and their comparison with the approach
presented here and the NLGC theory have to provide an answer whether particle
diffusion in one perpendicular direction is governed by the fluctuations in the
other normal direction or by fluctuations in the same direction.

varying as k^{-4} and k^{-3.5}, and apply two different initial core radii.
Calculations are included for both completely isothermal collapse, and a
non-isothermal equation of state above a critical density 10^{-14}gcm^{-3}. Our
calculations reveal the preference of fragmentation over monolithic star
formation in turbulent cores. Fragmentation was prevalent in all the isothermal
cases. Although disc fragmentation was largely suppressed in the non-isothermal
runs due to the small dynamic range between the initial density and the
critical density, our results show that some fragmentation still persisted.
This is inconsistent with previous suggestions that turbulent cores result in
the formation of a single massive star. We conclude that turbulence cannot be

anti-correlation is not due to a systematic error. The possibility that dust in
the foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginally
rejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of QSO colours. It is
possible that dust that obscures QSOs without reddening them, or preferentially
discards reddened QSOs from the 2QZ sample, could produce such an
anti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive QSO-galaxy
correlations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. Our detection of a
galaxy-QSO anti-correlation is consistent with statistical lensing theory. When
combined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-QSO
correlation, a consistent, compelling picture emerges that spans faint and
bright QSO samples showing positive or negative correlations according to the
QSO N(m) slope. We find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales.
We consider two models that use different descriptions of the lensing matter
and find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on
0.1Mpc/h scales of b~0.1 (for LCDM). Whilst the slope of our power-law fit to
the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation does not rule out linear bias, when we compare
our measurement of b on 100 kpc/h scales to independent methods that determine
b~1 on Mpc/h scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, is
scale-dependent. These results indicate more mass, at least on the 100 kpc/h
scales probed, than predicted by simple LCDM biasing prescriptions, and can
thus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.

to a phonon bottleneck situation, giving rise to butterfly-shaped hysteresis
loops below 5 K concomitant with slow decay of the magnetization for magnetic
fields Hz applied along the Fe--Fe axis. The butterfly curves are reproduced
using a microscopic model based on the interaction of the spins with resonant
phonons. The phonon bottleneck allows for the observation of resonant quantum
tunneling of the magnetization at 1.8 K, far above the blocking temperature for
spin-phonon relaxation. The latter relaxation is probed by AC magnetic

products inexpensively, and that self-replication is an effective approach to
very low-cost manufacturing. The research presented here is intended to be a
step towards this vision. In previous work (JohnnyVon 1.0), we simulated
machines that bonded together to form self-replicating strands. There were two
types of machines (called types 0 and 1), which enabled strands to encode
arbitrary bit strings. However, the information encoded in the strands had no
functional role in the simulation. The information was replicated without being
interpreted, which was a significant limitation for potential manufacturing
applications. In the current work (JohnnyVon 2.0), the information in a strand
is interpreted as instructions for assembling a polygonal mesh. There are now
four types of machines and the information encoded in a strand determines how
it folds. A strand may be in an unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight
(although they flex slightly due to virtual forces acting on the machines), or
in a folded state, in which the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By
choosing the sequence of machine types in a strand, the user can specify a
variety of polygonal shapes. A simulation typically begins with an initial
unfolded seed strand in a soup of unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates
by bonding with free machines in the soup. The child strands fold into the
encoded polygonal shape, and then the polygons drift together and bond to form
a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety of polygonal meshes can be manufactured
in the simulation, by simply changing the sequence of machine types in the
seed.

electromagnetic, and spin-s fields near conformal infinity I. The fields are
evaluated in normalized tetrads which are parallelly propagated along null
geodesics which approach a point P of I. The standard peeling-off property is
recovered and its meaning is discussed and refined. When the (local) character
of the conformal infinity is null, such as in asymptotically flat spacetimes,
the dominant term which is identified with radiation is unique. However, for
spacetimes with a non-vanishing cosmological constant the conformal infinity is
spacelike (for Lambda>0) or timelike (for Lambda<0), and the radiative
component of each field depends substantially on the null direction along which
P is approached. The directional dependence of asymptotic fields near such de
Sitter-like or anti-de Sitter-like I is explicitly found and described. We
demonstrate that the corresponding directional structure of radiation has a
universal character that is determined by the algebraic (Petrov) type of the
field. In particular, when Lambda>0 the radiation vanishes only along
directions which are opposite to principal null directions. For Lambda<0 the
directional dependence is more complicated because it is necessary to
distinguish outgoing and ingoing radiation. Near such anti-de Sitter-like
conformal infinity the corresponding directional structures differ, depending
not only on the number and degeneracy of the principal null directions at P but
also on their specific orientation with respect to I. The directional structure
of radiation near (anti-)de Sitter-like infinities supplements the standard
peeling-off property of spin-s fields. This offers a better understanding of
the asymptotic behaviour of the fields near conformal infinity.

gravitational perturbations. This is known as the Gregory-Laflamme instability.
It has been recently argued that there exists another general instability
affecting many rotating extended black objects. This instability is in a sense
universal, in that it is triggered by any massless field, and not just
gravitational perturbations. Here we investigate this novel mechanism in
detail. For this instability to work, two ingredients are necessary: (i) an
ergo-region, which gives rise to superradiant amplification of waves, and (ii)
``bound'' states in the effective potential governing the evolution of the
particular mode under study. We show that the black brane Kerr_4 x R^p is
unstable against this mechanism, and we present numerical results for
instability timescales for this case. On the other hand, and quite
surprisingly, black branes of the form Kerr_d x R^p are all stable against this
mechanism for d>4. This is quite an unexpected result, and it stems from the
fact that there are no stable circular orbits in higher dimensional black hole
spacetimes, or in a wave picture, that there are no bound states in the

monopoles that is an exact solution of the vacuum Einstein equations. Moreover,
the same isometry properties as the original Euclidean Taub-NUT space are
preserved. This leads to an Abelian Kaluza-Klein theory whose metric appears as
a combinations between the Gross-Perry-Sorkin and Schwarzschild ones. The
asymptotic motion of the scalar charged test particles is discussed, now by

Energy Condition [not just the Strong Energy Condition]. We stress that this is
an extremely robust result, which does not depend on assuming that the spatial
sections remain precisely flat in the early Universe. This means, however, that
it must be possible for string cosmologies to cross the recently much-discussed
""phantom divide"" [from w < -1 to w > -1, where w is the equation-of-state
parameter]. This naturally raises the question as to whether the phantom divide
can be crossed again, to account for recent observations suggesting that w < -1
at the present time. We argue that non-perturbative string effects rule out
this possibility, even if the NEC violation in question is only ""effective"".

in terms of the dimensions of the spaces spanned by the partial derivatives of
the forms generating the original space $V$. Rephrasing our result in the
language of commutative algebra (where this result finds its most important
applications), we have: let $A$ be a type $t$ artinian level algebra with
$h$-vector $h=(1,h_1,h_2,...,h_e)$, and let, for $c=1,2,...,t-1$,
$H^{c,gen}=(1,H_1^{c,gen},H_2^{c,gen},...,H_e^{c,gen})$ be the $h$-vector of
the generic type $c$ level quotient of $A$ having the same socle degree $e$.
Then we supply a lower-bound (in general sharp) for the $h$-vector $H^{c,gen}$.
Explicitly, we will show that, for any $u\in \lbrace 1,...,e\rbrace $,
$$H_u^{c,gen}\geq {1\over t^2-1}((t-c)h_{e-u}+(ct-1)h_u).$$ This result
generalizes a recent theorem of Iarrobino (which treats the case $t=2$).
Finally, we begin to obtain, as a consequence, some structure theorems for
level $h$-vectors of type bigger than 2, which is, at this time, a very little
explored topic.

anisotropy on the small scale statistics of velocity increments. According to
Kolmogorov, isotropy is recovered in the large Reynolds number limit as the
scale is reduced and, in the so-called inertial range, universal features
-namely the scaling exponents of structure functions - emerge clearly. However
this picture is violated in a number of cases, typically in the high shear
region of wall bounded flows. The common opinion ascribes this effect to the
contamination of the inertial range by the larger anisotropic scales, i.e. the
residual anisotropy is assumed as a weak perturbation of an otherwise isotropic
dynamics. In this case, given the rotational invariance of the Navier-Stokes
equations, the isotropic component of the structure functions keeps the same
exponents of isotropic turbulence. This kind of reasoning fails when the
anisotropic effects are strong as in the production range of shear dominated
flows. This regime is analyzed here by means of both numerical and experimental
data for a homogeneous shear flow. A well defined scaling behavior is found to
exist, with exponents which differ substantially from those of classical
isotropic turbulence. Contrary to what predicted by the perturbation approach,
such a deep alteration concerns the isotropic sector itself. The general
validity of these results is discussed in the context of turbulence near solid
walls, where more appropriate closure models for the coarse grained
Navier-Stokes equations would be advisable.

volatilities, but our model may also be suitable for other financial random
variables exhibiting the mean reversion property. The generalized model
contains, as particular cases, many early approaches in the literature of
volatilities or, more generally, of mean-reverting financial processes. We
analyze the long-time probability density function associated to the model

additive-multiplicative processes provide realistic models to describe

Radiation and some application to realistic beams with given cross section

approximations whose applicability limits and accuracy are often forgotten. We
begin remarking that on the one hand, a paraxial approximation can always be
applied without loss of generality and with ultra relativistic accuracy. On the
other hand, dominance of the acceleration field over the velocity part in the
Lienard-Wiechert expressions is not always granted and constitutes a separate
assumption, whose applicability is discussed. Treating Synchrotron Radiation in
paraxial approximation we derive the equation for the slow varying envelope
function of the Fourier components of the electric field vector. Calculations
of Synchrotron Radiation properties performed by others showed that the phase
of the Fourier components of the electric field vector differs from the phase
of a virtual point source. In this paper we present a systematic, analytical
description of this phase shift, calculating amplitude and phase of electric
field from bending magnets, short magnets, two bending magnet system separated
by a straight section (edge radiation) and undulator devices. We pay particular
attention to region of applicability and accuracy of approximations used.

age-structured populations, in which the individuals genomes are represented by
bit-strings. It provides a simple metaphor for the evolutionary process in
terms of the mutation accumulation theory. In its original version, an
individual dies due to inherited diseases when its current number of
accumulated mutations, n, reaches a threshold value, T. Since the number of
accumulated diseases increases with age, the probability to die is zero for
very young ages (n < T) and equals 1 for the old ones (n >= T). Here, instead
of using a step function to determine the genetic death age, we test several
other functions that may or may not slightly increase the death probability at
young ages (n < T), but that decreases this probability at old ones. Our
purpose is to study the oldest old effect, that is, a plateau in the mortality
curves at advanced ages. Imposing certain conditions, it has been possible to
obtain a clear plateau using the Penna model. However, a more realistic one
appears when a modified version, that keeps the population size fixed without
fluctuations, is used. We also find a relation between the birth rate, the
age-structure of the population and the death probability.

We give sufficient conditions for a considerable improvement of the key
generation rates and the security thresholds of well-known QKD protocols such
as Bennett-Brassard 1984, Phoenix-Barnett-Chefles 2000, and the six-state
protocol. This analysis is applicable to other QKD protocols like Bennett 1992.
We examine two scenarios: a sender using a perfect single-photon source and a
sender using a Poissonian source.

  equation","Submitted to Canadian J of Physics",,"10.1139/p05-027",,"quant-ph",,"  The connection between many-body theory (MBPT)--in perturbative and
non-perturbative form--and quantum-electrodynamics (QED) is reviewed for
systems of two fermions in an external field. The treatment is mainly based
upon the recently developed covariant-evolution-operator method for QED
calculations [Lindgren et al. Phys. Rep. 389, 161 (2004)], which has a
structure quite akin to that of many-body perturbation theory. At the same time
this procedure is closely connected to the S-matrix and the Green's-function
formalisms and can therefore serve as a bridge between various approaches. It
is demonstrated that the MBPT-QED scheme, when carried to all orders, leads to
a Schroedinger-like equation, equivalent to the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. A
Bloch equation in commutator form that can be used for an ""extended"" or
quasi-degenerate model space is derived. It has the same relation to the BS
equation as has the standard Bloch equation to the ordinary Schroedinger
equation and can be used to generate a perturbation expansion compatible with
the BS equation also for a quasi-degenerate model space.

  discussion","Fizika A 14, 29 (2005)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss some implications of a very recently obtained result for the force
on a slab in a planar cavity based on the calculation of the vacuum Lorentz
force [C. Raabe and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 71, 013814 (2005)]. We
demonstrate that, according to this formula, the total force on the slab
consists of a medium-screened Casimir force and, in addition to it, a
medium-assisted force. The sign of of the medium-assisted force is determined
solely by the properties of the cavity mirrors. In the Lifshitz configuration,
this force is proportional to 1/d at small distances and is very small compared
with the corresponding van der Waals force. At large distances, however, it is
proportional to 1/d^4 and is comparable with the Casimir force, especially for
denser media. The exponents in these power laws decrease by 1 in the case of a
thin slab. The formula for the medium-assisted force also describes the force
on a layer of the cavity medium, which has similar properties. For dilute
media, it implies an atom-mirror interaction of the Coulomb type at small and
of the Casimir-Polder type at large atom-mirror distances. For a perfectly
reflecting mirror, the latter force is effectively only three-times smaller
than the Casimir-Polder force.
