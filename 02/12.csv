TeV gamma-ray emission from any compact or extended region associated with the

to a factor 10 lower than previously-published fluxes from CANGAROO. For SN1006
at its current epoch of evolution we give limits for a number of important
global parameters. Upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity (for E=0.26 to 10
TeV, distance d=2 kpc) of L_gamma < 1.7x10^{33} erg s^{-1}, and the total
energy in corresponding accelerated protons, W_p<1.6\times 10^{50} erg (for
proton energies E_p \sim 1.5 to 60 TeV and assuming the lowest value n=0.05
cm^{-3} of the ambient target density discussed in literature) are estimated.
Extending this estimate to cover the range of proton energies observed in the
cosmic ray spectrum up to the knee (we take here E_p ~ 1 GeV to 3 PeV, assuming
a differential particle index -2) gives W_p<6.3x10^{50} erg. A lower limit on
the post-shock magnetic field of B>25microG results when considering the
synchrotron/inverse-Compton framework for the observed X-ray flux and gamma-ray

lifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are strongly
distinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.
Quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part of
the accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities powering
accretion. In this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but the
quasar is buried. Eventually, feedback from accretion energy disperses
surrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observable
optically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required to
maintain a quasar luminosity. We model this process and measure the unobscured
and intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxy
merger. The source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,
calculated from local gas properties. We calculate the column density of
hydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these column
densities and gas metallicities to determine B-band attenuation of the source.
Defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observed
B-band luminosity above some limit L_B,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 Myr for
L_B,min=10^11 L_sun (M_B=-23), in good agreement with observationally
determined quasar lifetimes. This is significantly smaller than the intrinsic
lifetime ~100 Myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. The ratio of observed
to intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosity
and the observed frequency.

phase transition from the ""free flow"" phase to the ""synchronized flow"" phase.
The main idea of this nucleation model is that random synchronized flow
nucleation occurs within a metastable inhomogeneous steady state associated
with a deterministic local perturbation in free flow, which can be considered
""deterministic vehicle cluster"" in free flow at the bottleneck. This
deterministic vehicle cluster in free flow is motionless and exists permanent
at the bottleneck due to the on-ramp inflow. In the nucleation model, traffic
breakdown nucleation occurs through a random increase in vehicle number within
this deterministic vehicle cluster, if the amplitude of the resulting random
vehicle cluster exceeds some critical amplitude. The mean time delay and the
associated nucleation rate of speed breakdown at the bottleneck are found and
investigated. The nucleation rate of traffic breakdown as a function of the
flow rates to the on-ramp and upstream of the bottleneck is studied. The
nucleation model and the associated results exhibit qualitative different
characteristics than those found earlier in other traffic flow nucleation
models. Boundaries for speed breakdown in the diagram of congested patterns at
the bottleneck are found. These boundaries are qualitatively correlated with
numerical results of simulation of microscopic traffic flow models in the

close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point, and to understand finite-size effects
inside this phase. The nature of the various phases has been further
investigated by calculating dimer-dimer correlation functions. The present
results confirm and complement the phase diagram proposed by Moessner and
Sondhi on the basis of finite-temperature simulations [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf

aligned along the step edges of Pt (533) and (322) vicinal substrates. We
employ an electronic structure method which scales linearly with the size of
the system. This allows us to treat with ease both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic solutions, and in principle the method should allow for the
evaluation of more complex systems, such as wires deposited on rough step
edges. We find that Co, Fe, and Mn are almost perfect Heisenberg systems, with
almost no change in the moment between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic
solutions. A large polarisation of the Pt substrate is also observed. Our
results are in close agreement w ith recent experimental results obtained for
the case of a Co monowire. As expected the trend is for the late d series to be
stabalised by ferromagnetic long range order and the middle of the d series by
antiferromagnetic order. Since our method is only \emph{locally} self
consistent we discuss as some length the convergence of the results with
respect to the size of the region which is treated self-consistently.

an example, we present detailed results for networks of chaotic logistic maps

deterministic pseudo-fractal scale-free network and Apollonian network. For
random scale-free topology we find that the lower boundary of the
synchronizability region scales approximately as $k^{-\mu}$, where $k$ is the
outgoing connectivity and $\mu$ depends on the local nonlinearity. For
deterministic scale-free networks coherence is observed only when the coupling
is heterogeneous, namely when it is proportional to some power of the neighbor
connectivity. In all cases, stability conditions are determined from the
eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplacian matrix and agree well with numerical
results based on histograms of coherent states in parameter space.
Additionally, we show that almost everywhere in the synchronizability region
the basin of attraction of coherent states fills the entire phase space, and
that the transition to coherence is of first-order.

to construct solutions to the constraint equations of general relativity. The
York method consists of choosing a 3-metric on a given manifold; a
divergence-free, tracefree (TT) symmetric 2-tensor wrt this metric; and a
single number, the trace of the extrinsic curvature. One then obtains a
quasi-linear elliptic equation for a scalar function, the Lichnerowicz-York
(L-Y) equation. The solution of this equation is used as a conformal factor to
transform the data into a set that satisfies the constraints. If the manifold
is compact and without boundary, one quantity that emerges is the volume of the
physical space. This article reinterprets the L-Y equation as an eigenvalue
equation so as to get a set of data with a preset physical volume. One chooses
the conformal metric, the TT tensor, and the physical volume, while regarding
the trace of the extrinsic curvature as a free parameter. The resulting
equation has extremely nice uniqueness and existence properties. A even more
radical approach would be to fix the base (conformal) metric, the physical
volume, and the trace. One also selects a TT tensor, but one is free to
multiply it by a constant(unspecified). One then solves the L-Y equation as an
eigenvalue equation for this constant. A third choice would be to fix the TT
tensor and and multiply the base metric by a constant. Each of these three
formulations has good uniqueness and existence properties.

cards, each serving 96 wires of the chamber. The TDC is physically configured
as a 9U VME card. The functionality is almost entirely programmed in firmware
in two Altera Stratix FPGA's. The special capabilities of this device are the
availability of 840 MHz LVDS inputs, multiple phase-locked clock modules, and
abundant memory. The TDC system operates with an input resolution of 1.2 ns.
Each input can accept up to 7 hits per collision. The time-to-digital
conversion is done by first sampling each of the 96 inputs in 1.2-ns bins and
filling a circular memory; the memory addresses of logical transitions (edges)
in the input data are then translated into the time of arrival and width of the
COT pulses. Memory pipelines with a depth of 5.5 $\mu$s allow deadtime-less
operation in the first-level trigger. The TDC VME interface allows a 64-bit
Chain Block Transfer of multiple boards in a crate with transfer-rates up to 47
Mbytes/sec. The TDC also contains a separately-programmed data path that
produces prompt trigger data every Tevatron crossing. The full TDC design and
multi-card test results are described. The physical simplicity ensures
low-maintenance; the functionality being in firmware allows reprogramming for
other applications.

  2004, organized by the Santa Fe Institute (9 pages and 6 figures)",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  Observations of the evolution of species groups in nature, such as well
recognized Galapagos finches, have motivated much theoretical research aimed at
understanding the processes associated with such radiations. The Penna model is
one such model and has been widely used to study aging. In this paper we use
the basic Penna model to investigate the process of sympatric speciation in a
simple food web model. Initially our web consists of a primary food source and
a single herbivore species that feeds on this resource. Subsequently we
introduce a predator that feeds on the herbivore. In both instances we directly
manipulate the food source, that is, its size distribution, and monitore the
changes in the populations structures. Sympatric speciation is obtained for the
consumer species in both webs, and our results confirm that the speciation
velocity depends on how far up,in the food chain, the focus population is
feeding. Simulations are done with three different sexual imprinting-like
mechanisms, in order to discuss adaptation by natural selection.

  rate data","11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Accepted Biophys J",,"10.1529/biophysj.104.052548",,"q-bio.BM q-bio.QM",,"  We determine both barrier heights and prefactors for protein folding by
applying constraints determined from experimental rate measurements to a
Kramers theory for folding rate. The theoretical values are required to match
the experimental values at two conditions of temperature and denaturant that
induce the same stability. Several expressions for the prefactor in the Kramers
rate equation are examined: a random energy approximation, a correlated energy
approximation, and an approximation using a single Arrhenius activation energy.
Barriers and prefactors are generally found to be large as a result of
implementing this recipe, i.e. the folding landscape is cooperative and smooth.
Interestingly, a prefactor with a single Arrhenius activation energy admits no
formal solution.

  photons in a cavity","1 figure",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.020101",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the influence of environmental noise on polarization entangled
light generated by parametric emission in a cavity. By adopting a recently
developed separability criterion, we show that: i) self-stimulation may
suppress the detrimental influence of noise on entanglement; ii) when
self-stimulation becomes effective, a classical model of parametric emission
incorporating noise provides the same results of quantum theory for the
expectation values involved in the separability criterion. Moreover we show
that, in the macroscopic limit, it is impossible to observe violations of local
realism with measurements of $n$-particle correlations, whatever n but finite.
These results provide an interesting example of the emergence of macroscopic
local realism in the presence of strong entanglement even in the absence of
decoherence.

A 72, 022341 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.022341",,"quant-ph",,"  Each classical public-coin protocol for coin flipping is naturally associated
with a quantum protocol for weak coin flipping. The quantum protocol is
obtained by replacing classical randomness with quantum entanglement and by
adding a cheat detection test in the last round that verifies the integrity of
this entanglement. The set of such protocols defines a family which contains
the protocol with bias 0.192 previously found by the author, as well as
protocols with bias as low as 1/6 described herein. The family is analyzed by
identifying a set of optimal protocols for every number of messages. In the
end, tight lower bounds for the bias are obtained which prove that 1/6 is
optimal for all protocols within the family.

collapse-inducing operator, constructed from quantum fields, is a manifestly
covariant generalization of the mass density operator utilized in the
nonrelativistic Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function
collapse model. However, the model is not Lorentz invariant because two such
operators do not commute at spacelike separation, i.e., the time-ordering
operation in one Lorentz frame, the ""preferred"" frame, is not the time-ordering
operation in another frame. However, the characteristic spacelike distance over
which the commutator decays is the particle's Compton wavelength so, since the
commutator rapidly gets quite small, the model is ""almost"" relativistic. This
""QRCSL"" model is completely finite: unlike previous, relativistic, models, it
has no (infinite) energy production from the vacuum state.
  QRCSL calculations are given of the collapse rate for a single free particle
in a superposition of spatially separated packets, and of the energy production
rate for any number of free particles: these reduce to the CSL rates if the
particle's Compton wavelength is small compared to the model's distance
parameter. One motivation for QRCSL is the realization that previous
relativistic models entail excitation of nuclear states which exceeds that of
experiment, whereas QRCSL does not: an example is given involving quadrupole
excitation of the $^{74}$Ge nucleus.

specified n-qubit unitary operation, U, without the use of ancilla qubits? We
show that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the
minimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a
suitable Finsler metric on SU(2^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have
the striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the
remainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order
differential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with
the usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being
given part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the
rest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful
approach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper
we construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide
lower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the
corresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions
to the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from
isometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the
computational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is
unique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal
Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size
instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a
doubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli
geodesics of exponential length.
