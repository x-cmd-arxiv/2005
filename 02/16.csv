type Ic supernovae, which have been stripped of their hydrogen and helium
envelopes. There appear to be two types of these explosions: those which are
approximately spherical (GRB980425/1998bw), and which are associated with weak
bursts, and the classical GRBs which generate ultrarelativistic jets
(GRB030329/SN2003dh). If this bimodality is real Swift will provide a clear
evidence for it.
  We propose that classical powerful GRBs, which generate ultrarelativistic
outflows, are a result of a formation of quark stars. Quark stars may provide
an additional energy for the explosion of SN Ic, but far more important is a
creation of a surface which acts as a membrane which cannot be penetrated by
baryons. A surface of a quark star allows only ultrarelativistic matter to
escape: photons, neutrinos, electron -- positron pairs and magnetic fields. The
formation of a quark star follows the initial core collapse in several minutes.
Possible evidence for this time delay is provided by BATSE precursors to GRBs,
as analyzed by Lazzati (2005).

find objects worthy of deeper study. Our data are generally well fit by
power-law models, with three cases having hard ($\Gamma<2; dN/dE \propto
E^{-\Gamma}$) spectra that indicate synchrotron peaks at $E \gsim 5$ keV.
Previous data had suggested a presence of absorption features in the X-ray
spectra of some BL Lacs. In contrast, none of these spectra show convincing
examples of line features, either in absorption or emission, suggesting that
such features are rare amongst BL Lacs, or, more likely, artifacts caused by
instrumental effects. We find significant evidence for intrinsic curvature
(steepening by $d\Gamma / d({\rm log} E) = 0.4 \pm 0.15$) in fourteen of the
seventeen X-ray spectra. This cannot be explained satisfactorily via excess
absorption, since the curvature is essentially constant from $0.5-6$ keV, an
observation which is inconsistent with the modest amounts of absorption that
would be required. We use the {\it XMM-Newton} Optical Monitor data with
concurrent radio monitoring to derive broadband spectral energy distributions

emission and model the spectral curvature we see as the result of episodic
particle acceleration.

observational characteristics with long duration GRBs, but the reason for which
their prompt emission peaks at lower photon energies, $E_p$, is still under
debate. Although many different models have been invoked in order to explain
the lower $E_p$ values, their implications for the afterglow emission were not
considered in most cases, mainly because observations of XRF afterglows have
become available only recently. Here we examine the predictions of the various
XRF models for the afterglow emission, and test them against the observations
of XRF 030723 and XRGRB 041006, the events with the best monitored afterglow
light curves in their respective class. We show that most existing XRF models
are hard to reconcile with the observed afterglow light curves, which are very
flat at early times. Such light curves are, however, naturally produced by a
roughly uniform jet with relatively sharp edges that is viewed off-axis (i.e.
from outside of the jet aperture). This type of model self consistently
accommodates both the observed prompt emission and the afterglow light curves
of XRGRB 041006 and XRF 030723, implying viewing angles $\theta_{obs}$ from the
jet axis of $(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)\sim 0.15\theta_0$ and $\sim \theta_0$,
respectively, where $\theta_0\sim 3$ deg is the jet half-opening angle. This
suggests that GRBs, XRGRBs and XRFs are intrinsically similar relativistic jets
viewed from different angles, corresponding to $\gamma(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)$
of less than 1, between 1 and a few, and more than a few, respectively, where
$\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. Future observations with Swift could help test
this unification scheme in which GRBs, XRGRBs and XRFs share the same basic
physics and differ only by their orientation relative to our line of sight.

comparable in mass to the LMC, although somewhat brighter in CO and fainter in
the FIR. Within dwarfs, we find that the CO luminosity, L_CO, is most strongly
correlated with the K-band and the far infrared luminosities. There are also
strong correlations with the radio continuum and B-band luminosities, and
linear diameter. We suggest that L_CO and L_K correlate well because the
stellar component of a galaxy dominates the midplane gravitational field and
thus sets the pressure of the atomic gas, which controls the formation of H_2
from HI. We compare our sample with more massive galaxies and find that dwarfs
and large galaxies obey the same relationship between CO and the 1.4 GHz radio
continuum (RC) surface brightness. This relationship is well described by a
Schmidt Law with Sigma_RC proportional to Sigma_CO^1.3. Therefore, dwarf
galaxies and large spirals exhibit the same relationship between molecular gas
and star formation rate (SFR). We find that this result is robust to moderate
changes in the RC-to-SFR and CO-to-H_2 conversion factors. Our data appear to
be inconsistent with large (order of magnitude) variations in the CO-to-H_2

near-infrared background ``excess'' (NIRBE) to the redshifted light from
Population III objects. To supply the required 25 keV/baryon at redshift 9, Pop
III massive stars must form with an efficiency exceeding 30% in all
``minihalos'' with virial temperatures above a few hundred kelvins: to avoid
excessive metal pollution, most of the baryons once in Pop III stars must end
up in intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Gas accretion onto such IMBHs must
either be inhibited or lead to early miniquasars with steep UV/X-ray spectra,
in order not to overproduce the present-day unresolved soft X-ray background.
In the latter case (NIRBE dominated by ""X-ray quiet miniquasars""), the total
mass density of IMBHs at redshift 9 must be >50 times higher than the mass
density of supermassive black holes observed today in the nuclei of galaxies. A
stellar-dominated NIRBE is less economical energetically: more than 5% of all
baryons in the universe must be processed into Population III stars. We survey
various aspects of the Population III hypothesis for the NIRBE, and show that
the ionizing photon budget required to account for the NIRBE is much larger
than that required to explain the high electron scattering optical depth

rise to the production of X-rays. The X-rays increase the degree of ionization
in a small to very extended region of the surrounding stellar wind, depending
on the X-ray luminosity. This has observable consequences for the structure and
dynamics of the accretion flow. In this paper we concentrate on the fundamental
paramaters of the most massive HMXBs, i.e. those with an OB supergiant
companion, including some systems exhibiting relativistic jets
(``microquasars'').

of SGR1806-20, a magnetar candidate. While practically all gamma-ray detectors
on any satellites were saturated during the first ~500 ms interval after the
onset, one of the particle detectors on GEOTAIL was not saturated and provided
unique measurements of the hard X-ray intensity and the profile for the first
600 ms interval with 5.48 ms time resolution. After ~50 ms from the initial
rapid onset, the peak photon flux (integrated above ~50 keV) reached the order
of 10^7 photons sec^{-1} cm^{-2}. Assuming a blackbody spectrum with kT=175
keV, we estimate the peak energy flux to be 21 erg sec^{-1} cm^{-2} and the
fluence (for 0-600 ms) to be 2.4 erg cm^{-2}. The implied energy release
comparable to the magnetic energy stored in a magnetar (~10^{47} erg) suggests
an extremely efficient energy release mechanism.

this work, we provide an evaluation of the current status of adhesive
gravitational clustering and a clear explanation of the assumptions involved.
Furthermore, we propose systematic generalizations with the aim to relax some

equations for self-gravitating particles on an expanding Friedmann background
and recover the popular `dust model' (pressureless fluid), which breaks down
after the formation of density singularities; then we investigate, in a unified
framework, two other models which, under the restrictions referred to above,
lead to the `adhesion approximation'. We apply the Eulerian and Lagrangian
perturbative expansions to these new models and, finally, we discuss some
non-perturbative results that may serve as starting points for workable
approximations of non-linear structure formation in the multi-stream regime. In
particular, we propose a new approximation that includes, in limiting cases,
the standard `adhesion model' and the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian

semiconductor quantum wire containing a single finite-size attractive impurity
under an external terahertz electromagnetic field illumination in the ballistic
limit. Within the effective mass free-electron approximation, the scattering
matrix for the system has been formulated by means of a time-dependent mode
matching method. Some interesting properties of the electron transmission for
the system have been shown through a few groups of numerical examples. It is
found that in the case of the comparative stronger field amplitude and the
frequency resonant with the two lowest lateral energy levels in the impurity
region, the field-induced intersubband transition dominates the process as if
without the impurity. And there is a step-arising on the transmission as a
function of the incident electron energy. However, in the case of lower field
amplitude and the non-resonant frequencies both multiple symmetry Breit-type
resonance peaks and asymmetry Fano-type dip lines appear in the electron
transmission dependence on the incident energy due to the presence of the
impurity and the external field. Therefore, within certain energy range the
transmission as a function of the field frequency and/or field amplitude shows
a rich structure. Moreover, the transmission dependence on the strength and
size of the impurity is also discussed. It is suggested that these results
mostly arise from the interplay effects between the impurity in a quantum wire
and the applied field.

influence of the external bias. This central idea is combined with an
open-boundary description of the geometry of the system that is divided into
three regions: left/right leads and the device region (``real simulation
region''). We have derived a general scheme to extract the set of initial
states in the device region that will be propagated in time with proper
transparent boundary-condition at the device/lead interface. This is possible
due to a new modified Crank-Nicholson algorithm that allows an efficient
time-propagation of open quantum systems. We illustrate the method in

system independent of the transient-current history upon application of the
bias. The present work is ideally suited to study ac transport and

required to invert the overlap operator, the time consuming part of the Hybrid
Monte Carlo algorithm, is too high. In this series of papers we introduced the
optimal approximation of the sign function and have been developing
preconditioning and relaxation techniques which reduce the time needed for the
inversion of the overlap operator by over a factor of four, bringing the
simulation of dynamical overlap fermions on medium-size lattices within the
range of Teraflop-computers.
  In this paper we adapt the HMC algorithm to overlap fermions. We approximate
the matrix sign function using the Zolotarev rational approximation, treating
the smallest eigenvalues of the Wilson operator exactly within the fermionic
force. We then derive the fermionic force for the overlap operator, elaborating
on the problem of Dirac delta-function terms from zero crossings of eigenvalues
of the Wilson operator. The crossing scheme proposed shows energy violations
which are better than O($\Delta\tau^2$) and thus are comparable with the
violations of the standard leapfrog algorithm over the course of a trajectory.
We explicitly prove that our algorithm satisfies reversibility and area
conservation. Finally, we test our algorithm on small $4^4$, $6^4$, and $8^4$

different damping signatures due to small corrections by neutrino decoherence,
neutrino decay, oscillations into sterile neutrinos, or other mechanisms, and
classify these signatures according to their energy (spectral) dependencies. We
demonstrate, at the example of short baseline reactor experiments, that damping
can severely alter the interpretation of results, e.g., it could fake a value
of $\sin(2\theta_{13})$ smaller than the one provided by Nature. In addition,
we demonstrate how a neutrino factory could constrain different damping models

easily the actual non-oscillation effects could be identified. We find that the
damping models cluster in different categories, which can be much better

regular variation provide ways to describe a broad range of extremal dependence
structures when marginal distributions are heavy tailed. Multivariate regular
variation provides a rich description of extremal dependence in the case of
asymptotic dependence, but fails to distinguish between exact independence and
asymptotic independence. Hidden regular variation addresses this problem by
requiring components of the random vector to be simultaneously large but on a
smaller scale than the scale for the marginal distributions. In doing so,
hidden regular variation typically restricts attention to that part of the
probability space where all variables are simultaneously large. However, since
under asymptotic independence the largest values do not occur in the same
observation, the region where variables are simultaneously large may not be of
primary interest. A different philosophy was offered in the paper of Heffernan
and Tawn [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 66 (2004) 497--546] which
allows examination of distributional tails other than the joint tail. This
approach used an asymptotic argument which conditions on one component of the
random vector and finds the limiting conditional distribution of the remaining
components as the conditioning variable becomes large. In this paper, we
provide a thorough mathematical examination of the limiting arguments building
on the orientation of Heffernan and Tawn [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat.

meson-exchange mechanisms or minimal substitution in the momentum dependence of

elucidated. A number of low-energy electronuclear observables, including (i)
$np$ radiative capture at thermal neutron energies and deuteron
photodisintegration at low energies, (ii) $nd$ and $pd$ radiative capture
reactions, and (iii) isoscalar and isovector magnetic form factors of $^3$H and
$^3$He, are calculated in order to make a comparative study of these models for
the current operator. The realistic Argonne $v_{18}$ two-nucleon and Urbana IX
or Tucson-Melbourne three-nucleon interactions are taken as a case study. For
$A$=3 processes, the bound and continuum wave functions, both below and above

contributions to some of the polarization observables in the

The long-range attenuation length in the cell was ~1.3 m and the estimated

yeast hybrid method, which contains false-positive and false-negative
simultaneously. Accordingly, while it is desirable to test such datasets
through further wet experiments, here we invoke recent developed network theory
to test such high throughput datasets in a simple way. Based on the fact that
the key biological processes indispensable to maintaining life are universal
across eukaryotic species, and the comparison of structural properties of the
protein interaction networks (PINs) of the two species with those of the yeast
PIN, we find that while the worm and the yeast PIN datasets exhibit similar
structural properties, the current fly dataset, though most comprehensively
screened ever, does not reflect generic structural properties correctly as it
is. The modularity is suppressed and the connectivity correlation is lacking.
Addition of interlogs to the current fly dataset increases the modularity and
enhances the occurrence of triangular motifs as well. The connectivity
correlation function of the fly, however, remains distinct under such interlogs
addition, for which we present a possible scenario through an in silico
modeling.

are basically two ways to solve problems in physics. One is to reduce the
problem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in
terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem
combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then
becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics.
Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated
into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators
provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics,
including entanglement and Feynman's rest of the universe. In addition, it is
noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a physics of
harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the Lorentz group
which can be represented by the group of two-by-two matrices commonly called
$SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can play the role of combining
quantum mechanics with special relativity. It is therefore possible to relate
the current issues of physics to the Lorentz-covariant formulation of quantum
mechanics.

the initial correlations in these examples can be dynamically generated (at

providing different ways of visualizing the x-p correlations present in these

assignment of states to physical systems (unit state vectors versus
non-idempotent density operators) we distinguish between strong/relational and
weak/deconstructional forms of quantum nonseparability. The origin of the
latter is traced down and discussed at length, whereas its relation to the all
important concept of potentiality in forming a coherent picture of the puzzling
entangled interconnections among spatially separated systems is also
considered. Finally, certain philosophical consequences of quantum
nonseparability concerning the nature of quantum objects, the question of
realism in quantum mechanics, and possible limitations in revealing the actual
