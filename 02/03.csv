increasing evidence that the Universe is undergoing a late time acceleration,

responsible for such a phenomenon. Among several candidates discussed in the

as a real possibility according to recent observational analysis. In this paper
we examine the invariant characterization for the energy-momentum tensor of

(300-30000 G), static, large-scale magnetic field, of a chiefly dipolar shape

Following their discovery fifty years ago, it was speculated that these fields
a remnants of the star's formation, a `fossil' field. Alternatively, they could
be generated by a dynamo process in the star's convective core. The dynamo
hypothesis has difficulty explaining high field strengths and the lack of a
correlation with rotation. The weakness of the fossil-field theory has been the
absence of known field configurations stable enough to survive in a star over
its lifetime. We demonstrate here the formation of stable magnetic field
configurations, with properties agreeing with those observed, by evolution from
arbitrary, unstable initial fields. The results are applicable equally to Ap
stars, magnetic white dwarfs and some highly magnetised neutron stars known as
magnetars. This establishes fossil fields as the natural, unifying explanation
for the magnetism of all these stars.

bound young mass-loosing stars. Using observational constraints on the orbits,
mass loss rates and wind velocities of these stars, we numerically model the
distribution of gas in the ~ 0.1--10'' region around Sgr A*. We find that
radiative cooling of recently discovered slow winds leads to the formation of
many cool filaments and blobs, and to a thin and rather light accretion disc of
about an arcsecond scale. The disc however does not extend all the way to our
inner boundary. Instead, hot X-ray emitting gas dominates the inner arcsecond.
In our simulations, cool streams of gas frequently enter this region on low
angular momentum orbits, and are then disrupted and heated up to the ambient
hot gas temperature. The accreting gas around Sgr A* is thus two-phase, with a
hot component, observable at X-ray wavelengths, and a cool component, which may
be responsible for the majority of time variability of Sgr A* emission on
hundred and thousand years time-scales. We obtain an accretion rate of a few
times 10^-6 msun/year, consistent with Chandra estimates, but variable on
time-scales even shorter than hundred years. These results strongly depend on
the chosen stellar orbits and wind parameters. Further observational input is
thus key to a better modelling of Sgr A* wind accretion.

photospheric emission from He-dominated atmospheres including C, N and O and
was instead interpreted as the first evidence for a coronal plasma around a
white dwarf. We show here that a recent high resolution Chandra LETGS spectrum
has more structure than expected from a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and
lacks the narrow lines of H-like and He-like C expected from a coronal plasma.
Moreover, a coronal model requires a total luminosity more than two orders of
magnitude larger than that of the star itself. Instead, the observed 20-80 AA
flux is consistent with photospheric models containing trace amounts of heavier
elements such as Fe. The soft X-ray flux is highly sensitive to the adopted
metal abundance and provides a metal abundance diagnostic. The weak X-ray
emission at 1 keV announced by O'Dwyer et al (2003) instead cannot arise from
the photosphere and requires alternative explanations. We echo earlier
speculation that such emission arises in a shocked wind. Despite the presence
of UV-optical O VIII lines from transitions between levels n=7-10, no X-ray O
VIII Ly alpha flux is detected. We show that O VIII Lyman photons can be
trapped by resonant scattering within the emitting plasma and destroyed by
photoelectric absorption.

morphological similarity between high-resolution H alpha and short wavelength
radio continuum emission, especially in the H alpha shell in the northwest
region. We separate thermal and nonthermal components of the emission, and find
a large synchrotron halo surrounding the galaxy. Comparison between H alpha and
X-band fluxes suggests that the emission at 3.6 cm is dominated by thermal
processes; an additional synchrotron component dominates the flux at 20 cm and
produces a modest fraction of the detected flux at 3.6 cm. The fluxes of three

component argues for active star formation throughout the disk for at least the

observed in January 2002 and a major outburst, called eruption, which started
in the beginning of February 2002. During pre-eruption the object seemed to be
relaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days
of December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,
resulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last
days of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.
The burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity
flash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form
of two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.
In mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its

Mon was evolving along the Hayashi track. This we interpret as an evidence that
the main energy source during decline was due to gravitational contraction of

2118, LDN 1616, LDN 1634, and Orion East to show how massive stars interact
with molecular clouds to trigger star formation. Our results support the
radiation-driven implosion model in which the ionization fronts from OB stars
compress a nearby cloud until the local density exceeds the critical value,
thereby inducing the cloud to collapse to form stars. We find that only BRCs
associated with strong IRAS 100 micron emission (tracer of high density) and
H-alpha emission (tracer of ionization fronts) show signs of ongoing star
formation. Relevant timescales, including the ages of O stars, expanding HII
regions, and the ages of CTTS, are consistent with sequential star formation.
We also find that CTTS are only seen between the OB stars and the BRCs, with
those closer to the BRCs being progressively younger. There are no CTTS leading
the ionization fronts, i.e., within the molecular clouds. All these provide
strong evidence of triggered star formation and show the major roles massive
stars play in sustaining the star-forming activities in the region.

apparent ellipticity, position angle of the major axis, centre coordinates,
core radius and beta-model power law index. Our procedure provides estimates of
these parameters by simultaneously fitting them all, overcoming some of the
difficulties induced by sparse data and low number statistics typical of this
kind of analysis. The cluster parameters were fitted in a 3 x 3 h^-2 sqMpc
region, measuring the background in a 2 <R< 2.5 h^-1Mpc annulus. We also
explore the correlations between shape and profile parameters and other cluster
properties. One third of this compact cluster sample has core radii smaller
than 50 h^-1 kpc, i.e. near the limit that our data allow us to resolve,
possibly consistent with cusped models. The remaining clusters span a broad
range of core radii up to 750 h^-1 kpc. More than 80 per cent of this sample
has ellipticity higher than 0.2. The alignment between the cluster and the
major axis of the dominant galaxy is confirmed, while no correlation is
observed with other bright cluster members. No significant correlation is found
between cluster richness and ellipticity. Instead, cluster richness is found to
correlate, albeit with large scatter, with the cluster core radius.[abridged]

Fe XVII 16.78 A/15.01 A line ratio increases significantly in the hotter flare

diffuse and patchy in contrast to the known filamentary emission seen along the

to the remnant but there is one area of emission in the south-east which is

clumpy ISM in a 1-D plane-parallel geometry by using the mega-grain
approximation, in which dusty clumps are regarded as very large particles (i.e.
mega-grains). The clumpiness of the stellar distribution is introduced by the
youngest stars embedded in the clumps. We assume a smooth spatial distribution
for older stars. The youngest stars are surrounded by denser dusty gas and
suffer stronger attenuation than diffuse older stars (i.e. age-selective
attenuation). The apparent attenuation law is a composite of the attenuation
laws for the clumpy younger stars and for the diffuse older stars with a
luminosity weight. In general, the stellar population dominating the luminosity
changes from older stars to younger stars as the wavelength decreases. This
makes the attenuation law steep; the composite attenuation rapidly increases
from small attenuation for older stars at a long wavelength to large
attenuation for younger stars at a short wavelength. The resultant attenuation
law of normal disc galaxies is expected to be much steeper than that of
starburst galaxies observed by Calzetti et al. Finally, the Calzetti's
attenuation law is regarded as a special case with a large density in our
framework.

provide a powerful diagnostic of GRB explosions and of the physics of particle

hence their name. It then follows that the equilibrium partition function of
the stochastic classical system partly controls the zero-temperature quantum
phase diagram, while the relaxation rates of the stochastic classical system
coincide with the excitation spectrum of the quantum problem. Given a generic
quantum Hamiltonian construed as an abstract operator defined on some Hilbert

representation of the quantum Hamiltonian is SMF decomposable, i.e., there is a
(continuous) manifold of distinct stochastic classical systems related to the

magnetic moments interacting with a sea of conduction electrons. It is one of
the most important canonical models in the study of a class of rare earth
compounds, called heavy fermion systems, and as such has been studied
intensively by a wide variety of techniques for more than a quarter of a
century. This review focuses on the one dimensional case at partial band
filling, in which the number of conduction electrons is less than the number of
localized moments. The theoretical understanding, based on the bosonized
solution, of the conventional Kondo lattice model is presented in great detail.
This review divides naturally into two parts, the first relating to the
description of the formalism, and the second to its application. After an
all-inclusive description of the bosonization technique, the bosonized form of
the Kondo lattice hamiltonian is constructed in detail. Next the
double-exchange ordering, Kondo singlet formation, the RKKY interaction and
spin polaron formation are described comprehensively. An in-depth analysis of
the phase diagram follows, with special emphasis on the destruction of the
ferromagnetic phase by spin-flip disorder scattering, and of recent numerical
results. The results are shown to hold for both antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic Kondo lattice. The general exposition is pedagogic in tone.

dependence of the copper and oxygen relaxation. We use the model of fluctuating

effective correlation time tau_eff characterizing the dynamics of the spin

correlations, which cause the hyperfine field constants to be added coherently

coherency is therefore controlled by the spin-spin correlations. The model is
used to determine the temperature-dependent correlation lengths. The

linear and a constant contribution that can be related to scattering and spin

become popular in recent years, and has served as a useful platform for both

  We settle this problem, by showing that deciding the outcome of an n x n
Amazons position is PSPACE-hard. We give a reduction from one of the
PSPACE-complete two-player formula games described by Schaefer. Since the
number of moves in an Amazons game is polynomially bounded (unlike Chess and
Go), Amazons is in PSPACE. It is thus on a par with other two-player,
bounded-move, perfect-information games such as Hex, Othello, and Kayles. Our
construction also provides an alternate proof that simple Amazons endgames are
NP-equivalent.

transition in SU(N) gauge theories, with the emphasis on what happens as N->oo.
We calculate the latent heat in the continuum limit, and find the expected
quadratic in N behaviour at large N. We confirm that the phase transition,
which is second order for SU(2) and weakly first order for SU(3), becomes
robustly first order for N>3 and strengthens as N increases. As an aside, we
explain why the SU(2) specific heat shows no sign of any peak as T is varied
across what is supposedly a second order phase transition. We calculate the
effective string tension and electric gluon masses at T=Tc confirming the
discontinuous nature of the transition for N>2. We explicitly show that the
large-N `spatial' string tension does not vary with T for T<Tc and that it is
discontinuous at T=Tc. For T>Tc it increases as T-squared to a good
approximation, and the k-string tension ratios closely satisfy Casimir Scaling.
Within very small errors, we find a single Tc at which all the k-strings
deconfine, i.e. a step-by-step breaking of the relevant centre symmetry does
not occur. We calculate the interface tension but are unable to distinguish
between linear or quadratic in N variations, each of which can lead to a
striking but different N=oo deconfinement scenario. We remark on the location
of the bulk phase transition, which bounds the range of our large-N
calculations on the strong coupling side, and within whose hysteresis some of
our larger-N calculations are performed.

study the implications of the assumed existence of this connection between

  First, accepting that in the $B \to \pi \pi$ decays the ratio $C/T$ of the
colour-suppressed factorization amplitude $C$ to the tree factorization
amplitude $T$ is negligible, we determine the ratio of individual penguin
amplitudes. Then, from the $B \to \pi \rho, \pi \omega$ data, we extract the
effective (i.e. possibly containing some penguin terms) tree and the effective
colour-suppressed amplitudes relevant for these processes, and the
corresponding solutions for the factorization amplitudes. Finally, we argue
that the $C/T$ ratio in $B \to \pi \pi $ should be identical to its counterpart
in $B \to \pi \rho, \pi \omega$ (relevant for pion emission from the decaying
$b$ quark). This constraint permits the determination of $C/T$ and of other
amplitude ratios directly from the data. Although the $|C/T|$ ratio extracted
from the available data still carries a substantial error, it is consistent
with the expected value of 0.25 - 0.5.

generically in string theory even if it is more difficult to calculate

generating small neutrino masses. We examine this issue in the context of the
well-known three-family standard-like Z_3 heterotic orbifolds, where the theory
is well enough known to construct the corresponding operators allowed by string
selection rules, and analyze the D- and F-flatness conditions. Surprisingly, we
find that a simple see-saw mechanism does not arise. It is not clear whether
this is a property of this construction, or of orbifolds more generally, or of
string theory itself. Extended see-saw mechanisms may be allowed; more analysis
will be needed to settle that issue. We briefly speculate on their form if
allowed and on the possibility of alternatives, such as small Dirac masses and
triplet see-saws. The smallness of neutrino masses may be a powerful probe of
string constructions in general. We also find further evidence that there are
only 20 inequivalent models in this class, which affects the counting of string
vacua.

The basic idea is that all such stacks have presentations to which one can
associate gauged sigma models, where the group gauged need be neither finite
nor effectively-acting. Such presentations are not unique, and lead to
physically distinct gauged sigma models; stacks classify universality classes
of gauged sigma models, not gauged sigma models themselves. We begin by
defining and justifying a notion of ``Calabi-Yau stack,'' recall how one
defines sigma models on (presentations of) stacks, and calculate of physical
properties of such sigma models, such as closed and open string spectra. We
describe how the boundary states in the open string B model on a Calabi-Yau
stack are counted by derived categories of coherent sheaves on the stack. Along
the way, we describe numerous tests that IR physics is
presentation-independent, justifying the claim that stacks classify
universality classes. String orbifolds are one special case of these
compactifications, a subject which has proven controversial in the past;
however we resolve the objections to this description of which we are aware. In
particular, we discuss the apparent mismatch between stack moduli and physical
moduli, and how that discrepancy is resolved.

illustrating the fundamental nature of this equation in the standard theory, we
make use of this geometric interpretation of the HBDE to answer the question of
what other infinitesimal generators could be used for similarly creating
tau-functions. The answer to this question involves a ``rank one condition'',
tying this investigation to the existing results on integrable systems

chaos transition displays a characteristic $f^{-\gamma}$ noise and $\gamma$ is
correlated with the classical chaos in the system. We demonstrate this using a
smooth potential and a time-dependent system modeled by Gaussian and circular
ensembles respectively of random matrix theory. We show the effect of short

  A","Nucl.Instrum.Meth. A547 (2005) 569-582","10.1016/j.nima.2005.03.151",,"nucl-ex",,"  We describe the neutron polarimeter NPOL3 for the measurement of polarization
transfer observables $D_{ij}$ with a typical high resolution of $\sim$300 keV
at $T_n$ $\simeq$ 200 MeV.
  The NPOL3 system consists of three planes of neutron detectors.
  The first two planes for neutron polarization analysis are made of 20 sets of
one-dimensional position-sensitive plastic scintillation counters with a size
of 100 cm $\times$ 10 cm $\times$ 5 cm, and they cover the area of 100 $\times$
100 $\mathrm{cm}^2$.
  The last plane for detecting doubly scattered neutrons or recoiled protons is
made of the two-dimensional position-sensitive liquid scintillation counter
with a size of 100 cm $\times$ 100 cm $\times$ 10 cm.
  The effective analyzing powers $A_{y;\mathrm{eff}}$ and double scattering
efficiencies $\epsilon_{\mathrm{D.S.}}$ were measured by using the three kinds
of polarized neutrons from the ${}^{2}{\rm H}(\vec{p},\vec{n})pp$, ${}^{6}{\rm
Li}(\vec{p},\vec{n}){}^{6}{\rm Be}(\mathrm{g.s.})$, and ${}^{12}{\rm
C}(\vec{p},\vec{n}){}^{12}{\rm N}(\mathrm{g.s.})$ reactions at $T_p$ = 198 MeV.
  The performance of NPOL3 defined as
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{D.S.}}(A_{y;\mathrm{eff}})^2$ are similar to that of the
Indiana Neutron POLarimeter (INPOL) by taking into account for the counter
configuration difference between these two neutron polarimeters.

revisit some properties of material media and the associated Green dyadics.
Some related features of ferrite are also investigated. It is well-known that
the constitutive tensor is essentially equivalent to the Riemann curvature
tensor. In order to investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in
material media, we prove that it is analogous to consider the electromagnetic
wave propagation in the vacuum, but this time in a curved spacetime, which is
obtained by a deformation of the lorenztian metric of Minkowski spacetime.
Spacetime deformations leave invariant the form of Maxwell equations. Also,
there exists a close relation between Maxwell equations in curved spacetime and
in an anisotropic material medium, indicating that electromagnetism and
spacetime properties are deeply related. Besides, the geometrical aspects of
wave propagation can be described by an effective geometry which represents a
deformation of the lorentzian metric of Minkowski spacetime.

that, prior to what appears to be a ``which-way'' measurement, an interference
pattern exists. Afshar has claimed that this result constitutes a violation of
the Principle of Complementarity. This paper discusses the implications of this
experiment and considers how Cramer's Transactional Interpretation easily
accomodates the result. It is also shown that the Afshar experiment is
analogous in key respects to a spin one-half particle prepared as ``spin up
along $\bf x$'', subjected to a nondestructive confirmation of that
preparation, and post-selected in a specific state of spin along $\bf z$.
  The terminology ``which-way'' or ``which-slit'' is critiqued; it is argued
that this usage by both Afshar and his critics is misleading and has
contributed to confusion surrounding the interpretation of the experiment.
Nevertheless, it is concluded that
  Bohr would have had no more problem accounting for the Afshar result than he
would in accounting for the aforementioned pre- and post-selection spin
experiment, in which the particle's preparation state is confirmed by a
nondestructive measurement prior to post-selection. In addition, some new
inferences about the interpretation of delayed choice experiments are drawn
