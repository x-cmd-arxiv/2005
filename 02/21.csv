EUV transient RE J1255+266. The star appears as a DA white dwarf with bright
emission lines and a complex spectrum of periodic signals in its light curve. A
signal at 0.0829 d is likely to be the orbital period of the underlying
cataclysmic binary (probably a dwarf nova). Characteristic periods of 1344,
1236, and 668 s are seen, and a host of weaker signals. We interpret these
noncommensurate signals as (nonradial) pulsation periods of the white dwarf.
The donor star is unseen at all wavelengths, and the accretion rate is very
low. We estimate a distance of 180+-50 pc, and M_v=14.6+-1.3 for the accretion
light. The binary probably represents a very late stage of evolution, with the
donor star whittled down to M_2<0.05 M_sol. Such binaries stubbornly resist
discovery due to their faintness and reluctance to erupt, but are probably a
very common type of cataclysmic variable. If the signal at 0.0829 d is indeed
the orbital period, then the binary is an excellent candidate as a ""period
bouncer"". Plausible colleagues in this club include four dwarf novae and the
(so far) noneruptive stars GD 552 and 1RXS J105010.3-140431 (hereafter RX
1050).
  The 1994 EUV eruption implies a soft X-ray/EUV luminosity of 10^(34-35)
erg/s, greater than that of any other dwarf nova. We attribute that to a
favorable blend of properties: a high-mass white dwarf; a very transparent line
of sight (the ""Local Chimney""); and a low binary inclination. The first
maximizes the expected temperature and luminosity of boundary-layer emission;
the other two increase the likelihood that soft X-rays can survive their
perilous passage through an accretion-disk wind and the interstellar medium.

binaries (BHXBs), it appears plausible that accretion disks in active galactic
nuclei (AGN) undergo a state transition between a radiatively efficient and
inefficient accretion flow. If the radiative efficiency changes at some
critical accretion rate, there will be a change in the distribution of black
hole masses and bolometric luminosities at the corresponding transition
luminosity. To test this prediction, I consider the joint distribution of AGN
black hole masses and bolometric luminosities for a sample taken from the
literature. The small number of objects with low Eddington-scaled accretion
rates mdot < 0.01 and black hole masses Mbh < 10^9 Msun constitutes tentative
evidence for the existence of such a transition in AGN. Selection effects, in
particular those associated with flux-limited samples, systematically exclude
objects in particular regions of the black hole mass-luminosity plane.
Therefore, they require particular attention in the analysis of distributions
of black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and derived quantities like the
accretion rate. I suggest further observational tests of the BHXB-AGN
unification scheme which are based on the jet domination of the energy output
of BHXBs in the hard state, and on the possible equivalence of BHXB in the very
high (or ""steep power-law"") state showing ejections and efficiently accreting
quasars and radio galaxies with powerful radio jets.

orbital eccentricities. Observations have shown that at least 20% of these
planets, including some with particularly high eccentricities, are orbiting a
component of a wide binary star system. The presence of a distant binary
companion can cause significant secular perturbations to the orbit of a planet.
In particular, at high relative inclinations, a planet can undergo a
large-amplitude eccentricity oscillation. This so-called ""Kozai mechanism"" is
effective at a very long range, and its amplitude is purely dependent on the
relative orbital inclination. In this paper, we address the following simple
question: assuming that every host star with a detected giant planet also has a
(possibly unseen, e.g., substellar) distant companion, with reasonable
distributions of orbital parameters and masses, how well could secular
perturbations reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution of planets? Our
calculations show that the Kozai mechanism consistently produces an excess of
planets with very high (e >0.6) and very low (e < 0.1) eccentricities. The
paucity of near-circular orbits in the observed sample cannot be explained
solely by the Kozai mechanism, because, even with high enough inclinations, the
Kozai mechanism often fails to produce significant eccentricity perturbations
when there are other competing sources of orbital perturbations on secular
timescales, such as general relativity. On the other hand, the Kozai mechanism
can produce many highly eccentric orbits. Indeed the overproduction of high
eccentricities observed in our models could be combined with plausible
circularizing mechanisms (e.g., friction from residual gas) to create more
intermediate eccentricities (e=0.1-0.6).

developed for interpreting solar spectropolarimetric observations, allows to
reconsider, in a more rigorous and elegant way, a physical mechanism that has
been suggested some years ago to interpret the high degree of polarization
often observed in astronomical masers. This mechanism, for which the name of
'dichroic maser' is proposed, can operate when a low density molecular cloud is
illuminated by an anisotropic source of radiation (like for instance a nearby
star). Here we investigate completely unsaturated masers and show that
selective stimulated emission processes are capable of producing highly
polarized maser radiation in a non-magnetic environment. The polarization of
the maser radiation is linear and is directed tangentially to a ring
equidistant to the central star. We show that the Hanle effect due to the
presence of a magnetic field can produce a rotation (from the tangential
direction) of the polarization by more that 45 degrees for some selected
combinations of the strength, inclination and azimuth of the magnetic field
vector. However, these very same conditions produce a drastic inhibition of the
maser effect. The rotations of about 90 degrees observed in SiO masers in the
evolved stars TX Cam by Kemball & Diamond (1997) and IRC+10011 by Desmurs et al
(2000) may then be explainedby a local modification of the anisotropy of the
radiation field, being transformed from mainly radial to mainly tangential.

companions to the total luminosity in the four DDs ranges between 10 and 20 per
cent. In the case of the two white dwarf - M dwarf binaries, WD1042-690 and
WD2009+622, we calculate the orbital parameters by fitting simultaneously the
absorption line from the white dwarf and the emission core from the M-dwarf.
Their orbital periods are 0.337083(1) d and 0.741226(2) d respectively. We find
signatures of irradiation on the inner face of WD2009+622's companion. We
calculate the masses of both components from the gravitational redshift and the
mass-radius relationship for white dwarfs and find masses of 0.75 -- 0.78 Msun
and 0.61 -- 0.64 Msun for WD1042-690 and WD2009+622 respectively. This
indicates that the stars probably reached the asymptotic giant branch in their
evolution before entering a common envelope phase. These two white dwarf - M
dwarf binaries will become cataclysmic variables, although not within a Hubble
time, with orbital periods below the period gap.

reinterpreted as revealing the presence of deep molecular layers. Empirical
models for a photosphere surrounded by a simple molecular layer or envelope
have led to a consistent interpretation of previously inconsistent data. The
stellar photospheres are found to be smaller than previously understood, and
the molecular layer is much higher and denser than predicted by hydrostatic
equilibrium. However, the analysis was based on spatial observations with
medium-band optical filters, which mixed the visibilities of different spatial
structures. This paper reports spatial interferometry with narrow spectral
bands, isolating near-continuum and strong molecular features, obtained for the
supergiant mu Cep. The measurements confirm strong variation of apparent
diameter across the K-band. A layer model shows that a stellar photosphere of
angular diameter 14.11+/-0.60 mas is surrounded by a molecular layer of
diameter 18.56+/-0.26 mas, with an optical thickness varying from nearly zero
at 2.15 microns to >1 at 2.39 microns. Although mu Cep and alpha Ori have a
similar spectral type, interferometry shows that they differ in their radiative
properties. Comparison with previous broad-band measurements shows the
importance of narrow spectral bands. The molecular layer or envelope appears to
be a common feature of cool supergiants.

careful analysis of image simulations; we are limited by the depth of the

M(V)<-20, or equivalently stellar masses log(M)>10. We find strong evolution in
the magnitude-size scaling relation for galaxies with M(V)<-20, corresponding
to a brightening of 1 mag per sqarcsec in rest-frame V-band by z=1. Yet, disks
at a given absolute magnitude are bluer and have lower stellar mass-to-light
ratios at z=1 than at the present day. As a result, our findings indicate weak
or no evolution in the relation between stellar mass and effective disk size
for galaxies with log(M)>10 over the same time interval. This is strongly
inconsistent with the most naive theoretical expectation, in which disk size
scales in proportion to the halo virial radius, which would predict that disks
are a factor of two denser at fixed mass at z=1. The lack of evolution in the
stellar mass-size relation is consistent with an ``inside-out'' growth of
galaxy disks on average (galaxies increasing in size as they grow more
massive), although we cannot rule out more complex evolutionary scenarios.

out in the last two years, the latter performed in response to a strong
sequence of hard X-ray bursts observed on 2004 October 5. The source was caught
in different states of activity: over the 2003-2004 period the 2-10 keV flux
doubled with respect to the historical level observed previously. The long term
raise in luminosity was accompanied by a gradual hardening of the spectrum,
with the power law photon index decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, and by a growth of
the bursting activity. The pulse period measurements obtained in the four
observations are consistent with an average spin-down rate of 5.5x10e-10 s/s,
higher than the values observed in the previous years. The long-term behavior
of SGR1806-20 exhibits the correlation between spectral hardness and spin-down
rate previously found only by comparing the properties of different sources
(both SGRs and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars). The best quality spectrum (obtained on
6 September 2004) cannot be fitted by a single power law, but it requires an
additional blackbody component (kT=0.79 keV, R_BB = 1.9 (d/15 kpc)^2 km),
similar to the spectra observed in other SGRs and in Anomalous X-ray Pulsars.
No spectral lines were found in the persistent emission, with equivalent width
upper limits in the range 30-110 eV. Marginal evidence for an absorption
feature at 4.2 keV is present in the cumulative spectrum of 69 bursts detected

algorithms such as the push-relabel algorithm exist for computing the exact

Simulations were carried out to investigate the scaling properties of the
push-relabel algorithm. The time evolution of the algorithm was studied along
with the statistics of an auxiliary potential field. At very small random
fields, the algorithm dynamics are closely related to the dynamics of
two-species annihilation, consistent with fractal statistics for the
distribution of minima in the potential (``height''). For $d=1,2$, a
correlation length diverging at zero disorder sets a cutoff scale for the
magnitude of the height field; our results are most consistent with a power-law
correction to the exponential scaling of the correlation length with disorder
in $d=2$. Near the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in $d=3$, the time to
find a solution diverges with a dynamic critical exponent of $z=0.93\pm0.06$
for a priority queue version and $z=0.43\pm0.06$ for a first-in first-out queue
version of the algorithm. The links between the evolution of auxiliary fields
in algorithmic time and the static physical properties of the RFIM ground state
provide insight into the physics of the RFIM and a better understanding of how

by a surface grating into a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed at
AlGaAs/GaAs heterointerface is measured as a function of electron density n_e
by analyzing commensurability oscillation of the magnetoresistance. The
electron density is varied either by applying a bias to a metallic back gate or
by illumination. The amplitude decreases with increasing density, with the rate
|dV_0/dn_e| roughly an order of magnitude larger for the former method. The
result is interpreted in terms of the rate, dE_1/d(delta E_c), of the change in
the first subband level E_1 in response to the variation of the conduction-band
edge delta E_c above the heterointerface. The rate crucially depends on the
thickness of the 2DEG.

molecular dynamics simulations in order to remove the heat produced
irreversibly over the course of such simulations. The simplest thermostat is
the Gaussian thermostat, which satisfies Gauss's principle of least constraint
and fixes the peculiar kinetic energy. There are of course infinitely many ways
to thermostat systems, e.g. by fixing $\sum\limits_i{|{p_i}|^{\mu + 1}}$. In
the present paper we provide, for the first time, convincing arguments as to
why the conventional Gaussian isokinetic thermostat ($\mu=1$) is unique in this
class. We show that this thermostat minimizes the phase space compression and
is the only thermostat for which the conjugate pairing rule (CPR) holds.
Moreover it is shown that for finite sized systems in the absence of an applied
dissipative field, all other thermostats ($\mu=1$) perform work on the system
in the same manner as a dissipative field while simultaneously removing the
dissipative heat so generated. All other thermostats ($\mu=1$) are thus
auto-dissipative. Among all $\mu$-thermostats, only the $\mu=1$ Gaussian
thermostat permits an equilibrium state.

rather large. Furthermore, an optimization of the perturbative expansion in
order to reduce the dependence on the renormalization scheme is performed. The
properties of the vacuum energy, with or without <A^2>, are investigated. It is
shown that in the original Gribov-Zwanziger formulation (without <A^2>), the
vacuum energy is always positive at 1-loop order, independently from the
renormalization scheme and scale. With <A^2>, we are unable to come to a
definite conclusion at the order considered. In the MSbar scheme, we still find
a positive vacuum energy, again with a relatively large expansion parameter,
but there are renormalization schemes in which the vacuum energy is negative,
albeit the dependence on the scheme itself appears to be strong. We recover the
well known consequences of the restriction, and this in the presence of <A^2>:
an infrared suppression of the gluon propagator and an enhancement of the ghost

approach the existence by considering limit of a sequence of front solutions to
a regularized traveling front equation where the nonlinearity is combustion
type with ignition cut-off. The limiting front equation is degenerate parabolic
and does not permit strong solutions, however, the necessary compactness
follows from monotonicity of fronts and degenerate regularity. We apply a
dynamic argument to justify that the constructed KPP traveling fronts propagate
at minimal speeds, and derive the speed variational formula. The dynamic method
avoids the degeneracy in traveling front equations, and utilizes the parabolic

triangulations of the interiors of compact 3-manifolds with tori or Klein
bottle boundaries. Such triangulations have been used with great effect,
following the pioneering work of Thurston. Ideal triangulations are the basis
of the computer program SNAPPEA of Weeks and the program SNAP of Coulson,
Goodman, Hodgson and Neumann. Casson has also written a program to find
hyperbolic structures on such 3-manifolds, by solving Thurston's hyperbolic
gluing equations for ideal triangulations.
  In this second paper, we study the question of when a taut ideal
triangulation of an irreducible atoroidal 3-manifold admits a family of angle
structures.
  We find a combinatorial obstruction, which gives a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of angle structures for taut triangulations. The
hope is that this result can be further developed to give a proof of the
existence of ideal triangulations admitting (complete) hyperbolic metrics.
  Our main result answers a question of Lackenby. We give simple examples of
taut ideal triangulations which do not admit an angle structure. Also we show
that for `layered' ideal triangulations of once-punctured torus bundles over
the circle, that if the manodromy is pseudo Anosov, then the triangulation
admits angle structures if and only if there are no edges of degree 2. Layered
triangulations are generalisations of Thurston's famous triangulation of the
Figure 8 knot space. Note that existence of an angle structure easily implies
that the 3-manifold has a CAT(0) or relatively word hyperbolic fundamental
group.

intrinsic neuronal variability on spiking behavior require a distributed mode

how variability and adaptivity in ion channel conductances can be utilized to
store patterns without an additional contribution by synaptic plasticity (SP).
The adaptation of the spike response may result in either ""positive"" or
