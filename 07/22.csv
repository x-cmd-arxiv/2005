in a region of enhanced radio emission due to the presence of a distorted radio
jet. We present results that indicate that this fast outflow is caused by a
jet-ISM interaction. The kinematics of the outflowing ionized gas are very
similar to those of a fast outflow of neutral hydrogen gas in this galaxy,
suggesting that both outflows are the result of the same driving mechanism.
While the mass of the outflowing ionized gas is about 1 x 10e5 M_sun, the total
HI mass involved in the neutral outflow is about 100 times higher (10e7 M_sun).
This shows that, despite the high energies that must be involved in driving the
outflow, most of the gas remains, or becomes again, neutral. Other outflows of
ionized gas, although not as pronounced as in the region of the enhanced radio
emission, are also seen in various other regions along the axis of the inner

sources of systematic bias in our LF measurements before drawing the following
conclusions. We find that the luminosity function of Lyman Break Galaxies
evolves with time and that this evolution is likely differential with
luminosity. The result is best constrained between the epochs at z~4 and z~3,
where we find that the number density of sub-L* galaxies increases with time by
at least a factor of 2.3 (11sigma statistical confidence); while the faint end
of the LF evolves, the bright end appears to remain virtually unchanged,
indicating that there may be differential, luminosity-dependent evolution
significant at the 97% level. Potential systematic biases restric our ability
to draw strong conclusions about continued evolution of the luminosity function
to lower redshifts, z~2.2 and z~1.7, but, nevertheless, it appears certain that
the number density of z~2.2 galaxies at all luminosities we studied,
-22<M_1700A<-18, is at least as high as that of their counterparts at z~3.
While it is not yet clear what mechanism underlies the observed evolution, the

that the HVS is a short-period, low-amplitude variable, with period P=0.2-2

resolving the previously-reported two-fold degeneracy in the luminosity and

then stars can contribute only 15-20% of the surface mass density at the

microlensing is present and sufficient to explain existing data. Under this

begun to yield to observations, naturally appear in dense stellar fields and
may be particularly sensitive to fine granularity in the mass distribution. The
microlensing magnification maps for overfocussed (i.e., demagnified) images
differ strikingly from those for magnified images. In particular, the familiar
""fold"" and ""cusp"" features of maps for magnified images are only present for
certain values of the fraction, f, of the surface mass density contained in
stars. For central images, the dispersion in microlensing magnifications is
generally larger than for normal (minimum and saddle) images, especially when
the source is comparable to or larger than the stellar Einstein radius. The
dispersion depends in a complicated way on f; this behaviour may hold the key
to using microlensing as a probe of the relative densities of stars and dark
matter in the cores of distant galaxies. Quantitatively, we predict that the
central image C in PMN J1632-0033 has a magnification dispersion of 0.6
magnitudes for Rsrc/Rein <~ 1, or 0.3 mag for Rsrc/Rein = 10. For comparison,
the dispersions are 0.5-0.6 mag for image B and 0.05-0.1 mag for image A, if
Rsrc/Rein <~ 1; and just 0.1 mag for B and 0.008 mag for A if Rsrc/Rein = 10.
(The dispersions can be extrapolated to larger sources sizes as sigma \propto
Rsrc^{-1}.) Thus, central images are more susceptible than other lensed images
to microlensing and hence good probes for measuring source sizes.

neutral and ionized gas. Recently, Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, & Hernquist
developed a simple analytic model to describe the growth of HII regions during
this era. Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions
behind this model and generalise it in several important ways. The model
predicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size R_c
that ranges from R_c~1 Mpc in the early phases to R_c>10 Mpc in the late
phases. We show that R_c is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies
driving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental
property of the first galaxies. The variance around R_c, on the other hand, is
determined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that
increasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts R_c to
significantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations.
These differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21 cm surveys
(increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of two on
large scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background. Finally, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the
galaxy population only broaden the bubble size distribution significantly if
massive galaxies are responsible for most of the ionizing photons. We argue
that the key results of this model are robust to many of our uncertainties
about the reionization process.

process by which isolated disks evolve. We concentrate on the buildup of dense
central features that look like classical, merger-built bulges but that were
made slowly out of disk gas. We call these pseudobulges. As an existence proof,
we review how bars rearrange disk gas into outer rings, inner rings, and gas
dumped into the center. In simulations, this gas reaches high densities, and in
the observations, many SB and oval galaxies show central concentrations of gas.
Associated star formation rates imply plausible pseudobulge growth times of a
few billion years. If secular processes built dense centers that masquerade as
bulges, can we distinguish them from merger-built bulges? Observations show
that pseudobulges retain a memory of their disky origin. They have one or more
characteristics of disks: (1) flatter shapes than those of classical bulges,
(2) larger ratios of ordered to random velocities, (3) smaller velocity
dispersions, (4) nuclear bars or spiral structure, (5) boxy structure when seen
edge-on, (6) nearly exponential brightness profiles, and (7) starbursts. These
features occur preferentially in barred and oval galaxies in which secular
evolution should be rapid. So the cleanest examples of pseudobulges are
recognizable. Thus observations and theory contribute to a new picture of
galaxy evolution that complements hierarchical clustering and merging. However,
an important problem with cold dark matter galaxy formation gets more acute.
How can hierarchical clustering produce so many pure disk galaxies with no
evidence for merger-built bulges?

jet are directed radially away from the exciting source, and velocity
variability in the flow drives the shock waves that heat the jet internally.
The jet orientation angle varies with time by about 15 degrees, and currently
points to the northwestern portion of a cavity outlined by a reflection nebula,
where a quasi-stationary shock deflects the jet. The major working surface HH
47A is more complex than a simple bow shock/Mach disk, and contains numerous
clumps that move relative to one another with velocities of ~ +/- 40 km/s.
Small clumps or instabilities affect the Mach disk, and dense clumps may move
all the way through the working surface to cause the bumpy morphology seen at
the bow shock. A localized area between the bow shock and Mach disk varies
significantly between the two sets of images.

with spectral energy distribution fitting enabled us to identify 4 quasars and
42 stars, including 3 white dwarf candidates. Two of these white dwarf
candidates, HDFS 1444 and 895, are found to display significant proper motion,
21.1 $\pm$ 7.9 mas/yr and 34.9 $\pm$ 8.0 mas/yr, and are consistent with being
thick disk or halo white dwarfs located at ~2 kpc. The other faint blue objects
analyzed by Mendez & Minniti do not show any significant proper motion and are
inconsistent with being halo white dwarfs; they do not contribute to the
Galactic dark matter. The observed population of stars and white dwarfs is
consistent with standard Galactic models.

  the solar corona",,"Astrophys.J.637:1113-1121,2006","10.1086/498499",,"astro-ph",,"  It is argued that depolarization of solar radio bursts requires reflection
off boundary layers no thicker than about a wavelength (a few meters at most)
between regions with large density ratios. The implied inhomogeneities suggest
that the corona is much more highly and sharply structured than can be resolved
from observations at other wavelengths. A simplified version of magnetoionic
theory is used to derive a depolarization coefficient: the effect of the
magnetic field is ignored in treating the dispersion, but taken into account in
treating the (circular) polarization. Plots of the depolarization coefficient
are used to infer conditions under which effective depolarization occurs, and
it is concluded that favorable conditions require total internal reflection.
For type I sources away from the central meridian, effective depolarization
requires reflection off an overdense structure with a density ratio
$\xi\approx10$. For type III bursts, a density ratio $\xi\approx2$ suffices,
with at least two reflections off walls of ducts at $\approx20^\circ$ to the
radial.

temperature range. For the first time, we were able to constrain the age at
which non-standard mixing processes, driving MS Li depletion, appear. We have
also shown that MS Li depletion is not a continuous process and cannot be
simply described by a t^(-alpha) law. We confirm that depletion becomes
ineffective beyond an age of 1-2 Gyr for the majority of the stars, leading to
a Li plateau at old ages. We compared the empirical scenario of Li as a
function of age with the predictions of three non-standard models. We found
that models including only gravity waves as main mixing process are not able to
fit the Li vs. age pattern and thus this kind of mixing can be excluded as the
predominant mechanism responsible for Li depletion. On the other hand, models
including slow mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum loss, and in
particular those including also diffusive processes not related to rotation,
can explain to some extent the empirical evidence. However, none of the
currently proposed models can fit the plateau at old ages.

The BLC possesses a focal plane mask with an occulting spot whose opacity
profile is a spatially band-limited function rather than a hard-edged, opaque

Undersizing the stop in the re-imaged pupil plane (the Lyot plane) following
the focal plane mask can alleviate second order effects of astigmatism, at the
expense of system throughput and angular resolution. The optimal degree of such
undersizing depends on individual instrument designs and goals. Our analytical

overcome, constraints from event anomalies and model parameter uncertainties
can be incorporated into the estimate. Probability densities for given events
need to be carefully distinguished from the statistical distribution of the
same parameters among the underlying population from which the actual lenses
and sources are drawn. Using given model distributions of the mass spectrum,
the mass density, and the velocity distribution of Galactic disk and bulge
constituents, probability densities of lens mass, distance, and the effective
lens-source velocities are derived, where the effect on the distribution that
arises from additional observations of annual parallax or finite-source

formalism can also be used to calculate probabilities for the lens to belong to
one or another population and to estimate parameters that characterize
anomalies. Finally, it is shown how detection efficiency maps for binary-lens
companions in the physical parameters companion mass and orbital semi-major
axis arise from values determined for the mass ratio and dimensionless
projected separation parameter, including the deprojection of the orbital
motion for elliptical orbits. Compared to the naive estimate based on 'typical

mixing in higher detection efficiencies for smaller mass ratios (i.e. smaller
masses of the primary).

obtained and their consequences explored, for example, monomer-dimer equilibria
are established approximately twenty times slower than in a dilute solution.

strong-coupling limit, where electrostatic correlations mediated by counterions
become significantly large as, for instance, realized in systems with
high-valency counterions. In the particular case of two apposed and ideally
polarizable planar surfaces with equal mean surface charge, we find that the
effect of the disorder is nil on the mean-field level and thus the plates
repel. In the strong-coupling limit, however, the effect of charge disorder
turns out to be additive in the free energy and leads to an enhanced long-range
attraction between the two surfaces. We show that the equilibrium inter-plate
distance between the surfaces decreases for elevated disorder strength (i.e.
for increasing mean-square deviation around the mean surface charge), and
eventually tends to zero, suggesting a disorder-driven collapse transition.

layered state (also referred to as ``stratified morphology''). This state is
reminiscent of the situation where the thin film is still in the one-phase

layers. This metastable state decays by spinodal fluctuations and crosses over
to an asymptotic growth regime characterized by the lateral coarsening of
pancake-like domains. These pancakes may or may not be coated by precursors of
wetting layers. We use Langevin simulations to study this crossover and the
growth kinetics in the asymptotic coarsening regime.

human interactors--the effect of tracking faces during an interaction. It also
describes the architecture of a robot that can participate in conversational,
collaborative interactions with engagement gestures. Finally, the paper reports
on findings of experiments with human participants who interacted with a robot
when it either performed or did not perform engagement gestures. Results of the
human-robot studies indicate that people become engaged with robots: they
direct their attention to the robot more often in interactions where engagement
gestures are present, and they find interactions more appropriate when
engagement gestures are present than when they are not.

is devised to meet the requirements of image understanding and pattern
recognition tasks. Generally image understanding assumes interplay of two
sub-processes: image information content discovery and image information
content interpretation. Despite of its widespread use, the notion of ""image
information content"" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most
often, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content
assessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely
resort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into
their meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually
relevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human
attention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an
unorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image
decomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for
subsequent image interpretation. We provide some illustrative examples,
demonstrating effectiveness of this approach.

context of the landscape, where the solution of the hierarchy problem is
connected to the requirement of having baryons in our universe via Electroweak
Baryogenesis. The phase transition is triggered by the fermion condensation of
a new gauge sector which becomes strong at a scale Lambda determined by
dimensional transmutation, and it is mediated to the standard model by a new
singlet field. In a ``friendly'' neighborhood of the landscape, where only the
relevant operators are ``scanned'' among the vacua, baryogenesis is effective
only if the higgs mass m_h is comparable to this low scale Lambda, forcing m_h
to be of order Lambda, and solving the hierarchy problem. A new CP violating
phase is needed coupling the new singlet and the higgs field to new matter
fields. We study the constraints on this model given by baryogenesis and by the
electron electric dipole moment (EDM), and we briefly comment on gauge coupling
unification and on dark matter relic abundance. We find that next generation
experiments on the EDM will be sensitive to essentially the entire viable
region of the parameter space, so that absence of a signal would effectively
rule out the model.

hand there is overwhelming evidence that QCD and all non-abelian theories admit
an effective string description. Here we review a derivation of the (intrinsic)

string takes place on a background where chiral symmetry is spontaneously
broken. Requiring conformal invariance leads to the equation of motion of the
chiral Lagrangian. We then proceed to coupling the string degrees of freedom to
external gauge fields and we recover in this way the covariant equations of
motion of the gauge-invariant chiral Lagrangian at p^2 order. We consider next
the parity-odd part (Wess-Zumino-Witten) action and argue that this require the
introduction of the spin degrees of freedom (absent in the usual effective
action treatment). We manage to reproduce the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in 2D in
an unambiguous way. In 4D the situation is considerably more involved. We
outline the modification of boundary interaction that is necessary to induce
the parity-odd part of the chiral Lagrangian.

shift symmetries gauged by three-form gauge fields. The anomalous symmetries of
the Standard Model (such as Peccei-Quinn or $B+L$) can be dualized to local
symmetries gauged by the Chern-Simons three-forms of the Standard Model gauge
group. In this description the strong CP problem can be reformulated as the
problem of a massless three-form field in QCD, which creates an arbitrary
CP-violating constant four-form electric field in the vacuum. Both the axion as
well as the massless quark solutions amount to simply Higgsing the three-form
gauge field, hence screening the electric field in the vacuum. This language
gives an alternative way for visualizing the physics of the axion solution as
well as the degree of its vulnerability due to gravitational corrections. Any
physics that can jeopardize the axion solution must take the QCD three-form out
of the Higgs phase. This can only happen if the physics in question provides an
additional massless three-form. The axion then Higgses one combination of the
three-forms and the QCD electric field gets partially unscreened, reintroducing
the strong CP problem. Gravity provides such a candidate in form of the
Chern-Simons spin connection three-form, which could un-Higgs the QCD
three-form in the absence of additional chiral symmetries. We also discuss
analogous effects for the baryon number symmetry.

maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a three-sphere to the lowest
modes of the scalar fields. In fact, our studies mimic the current
investigations concerning the integrability properties of this gauge theory.
Like in the field theory we can prove the planar integrability of the SO(6)
model at first perturbative order. At higher orders we restrict ourselves to
the widely studied SU(2) subsector spanned by two complexified scalar fields of
the theory. We show that our toy model satisfies all commonly studied
integrability requirements such as degeneracies in the spectrum, existence of
conserved charges and factorized scattering up to third perturbative order.
These are the same qualitative features as the ones found in super Yang-Mills
theory, which were enough to conjecture the all-loop integrability of that
theory. For the SO(6) model, however, we show that these properties are not
sufficient to predict higher loop integrability. In fact, we explicitly
demonstrate the breakdown of perturbative integrability at fourth order.

thermally radiating hadrons at the deconfinement temperature. In gauge theories
that have a dual description that is well approximated by a theory of gravity

classically stable finite energy black holes localized in the IR. We present a
conjecture for the qualitative nature of large mass black holes in such
backgrounds, and numerically construct these black holes in a particular class
of warped geometries. These black holes have novel properties; in particular
their temperature approaches a nonzero constant value at large mass. Black
holes dual to plasma-balls shrink as they decay by Hawking radiation; towards
the end of this process they resemble ten dimensional Schwarzschild black
holes, which we propose are dual to small plasma-balls. Our work may find
practical applications in the study of the physics of localized black holes

complex projective space P(V), where V carries a real structure, and completely
determined their homotopy type. We also extended some functors in K-theory to
algebraic cycles, establishing a direct relationship to characteristic classes
for the classical groups, specially Stiefel-Whitney classes. In this sequel, we
establish corresponding results in the case where V has a quaternionic
structure. The determination of the homotopy type of quaternionic algebraic
cycles is more involved than in the real case, but has a similarly simple
description. The stabilized space of quaternionic algebraic cycles admits a
nontrivial infinite loop space structure yielding, in particular, a delooping
of the total Pontrjagin class map. This stabilized space is directly related to
an extended notion of quaternionic spaces and bundles (KH-theory), in analogy
with Atiyah's real spaces and KR-theory, and the characteristic classes that we
introduce for these objects are nontrivial. The paper ends with various
examples and applications.

classes of the tangent bundle on the Hilbert scheme of points on the affine

points on the affine plane by proving a result on the existence of certain
universal formulas expressing characteristic classes on the Hilbert schemes in
term of Nakajima's creation operators.
  The purpose of this work is (at least) two-fold. First of all, we clarify the
notion of ``universality'' of certain formulas about the cohomology of the
Hilbert schemes by defining a universal algebra of creation operators. This
helps us to reformulate and extend a lot of the first author's previous results
in a very precise manner.
  Secondly, we are able to extend the previously found results by showing how
to calculate any characteristic class of the Hilbert scheme of points on the
affine plane in terms of the creation operators. In particular, we have
included the calculation of the total Segre class and the square root of the
Todd class.
  Using this methods, we have also found a way to calculate any characteristic
class of any tautological sheaf on the Hilbert scheme of points on the affine
plane. This in fact gives another complete description of the ring structure of
the cohomology spaces of the Hilbert schemes of points on the affine plane.

that at small positive energies the phase space of our model is completely
chaotic except for a single region of complete integrability with a smooth
sharp boundary showing no KAM-type structures of any kind. This results in the
cleanest mixed phase space structure possible, in which motions in the
integrable region and in the chaotic region are clearly separated and
independent of one another. For certain system parameters, this mixed phase
space structure can be tuned to make either of the two components disappear,
leaving a completely integrable or completely chaotic phase space. For other
values of the system parameters, additional structures appear, such as KAM-like
elliptic islands, and one parameter families of parabolic periodic orbits
embedded in the chaotic sea. The latter are analogous to bouncing ball orbits
seen in the stadium billiard. The analytical part of our study proceeds from a
geometric description of the dynamics, and shows it to be equivalent to a
linked twist map on the union of two intersecting disks.

  forecasting: Insights from a simple stochastic model","Revised version. Recommended for publication in Tectonophysics",,"10.1016/j.tecto.2006.03.039",,"physics.geo-ph physics.data-an",,"  Numerical models are starting to be used for determining the future behaviour
of seismic faults and fault networks. Their final goal would be to forecast
future large earthquakes. In order to use them for this task, it is necessary
to synchronize each model with the current status of the actual fault or fault
network it simulates (just as, for example, meteorologists synchronize their
models with the atmosphere by incorporating current atmospheric data in them).
However, lithospheric dynamics is largely unobservable: important parameters
cannot (or can rarely) be measured in Nature. Earthquakes, though, provide
indirect but measurable clues of the stress and strain status in the
lithosphere, which should be helpful for the synchronization of the models. The
rupture area is one of the measurable parameters of earthquakes. Here we
explore how it can be used to at least synchronize fault models between
themselves and forecast synthetic earthquakes. Our purpose here is to forecast
synthetic earthquakes in a simple but stochastic (random) fault model. By
imposing the rupture area of the synthetic earthquakes of this model on other
models, the latter become partially synchronized with the first one. We use
these partially synchronized models to successfully forecast most of the
largest earthquakes generated by the first model. This forecasting strategy
outperforms others that only take into account the earthquake series. Our
results suggest that probably a good way to synchronize more detailed models
with real faults is to force them to reproduce the sequence of previous
earthquake ruptures on the faults. This hypothesis could be tested in the
future with more detailed models and actual seismic data.

by recognizing that quantum states do not only contain information about the
intrinsic properties of a system but about its extrinsic properties as well,
that is, about its relation to other systems external to it. Specifically, the
coherent quantum state of the factist is the appropriate description of the
relation of the system to one reference frame, while the incoherent quantum
state of the fictionist is the appropriate description of the relation of the
system to another, uncorrelated, reference frame. The two views, we conclude,
are alternative but equally valid paradigms of description.

Scheibe, Folse, Howard, Held, and others), on the other hand, was grounded in a
seemingly different doctrine about the possibility of objective knowledge,
namely the necessity of classical concepts. In fact, it follows from Raggio's
Theorem in algebraic quantum theory that - within an appropriate class of
physical theories - suitable mathematical translations of the doctrines of Bohr
and Einstein are equivalent. Thus - upon our specific formalization - quantum
mechanics accommodates Einstein's Trennungsprinzip if and only if it is
interpreted a la Bohr through classical physics. Unfortunately, the
protagonists themselves failed to discuss their differences in this
constructive way, since their debate was dominated by Einstein's ingenious but
ultimately flawed attempts to establish the ""incompleteness"" of quantum
mechanics.
  This aspect of their debate may still be understood and appreciated, however,
as reflecting a much deeper and insurmountable disagreement between Bohr and
Einstein on the knowability of Nature. Using the theological controversy on the
knowability of God as a analogy, Einstein was a Spinozist, whereas Bohr could
be said to be on the side of Maimonides. Thus Einstein's off-the-cuff
characterization of Bohr as a 'Talmudic philosopher' was spot-on.
