extracted the angular power spectrum for the identified CMB component and found
a very good agreement with the already published BEAST CMB angular power

the presence of a compact, hot, magnetized disk feeding the accretor. In such
low-Mach-number plasmas, forces arising, e.g., from pressure gradients in the
plasma, can altogether negate the warping of disks around Kerr black holes
caused by the Bardeen-Petterson effect and can lead to coherent precession of
the entire disk. In this Letter, we present for the first time highly detailed

indeed the Bardeen-Petterson effect is probably absent in this source. Given
what we now understand regarding the emission geometry in this object, we
suggest that a ~ 50-500-day modulation in Sgr A*'s spectrum, arising from the

106-day period seen earlier in its radio flux, if confirmed, could be due to
this process. On the other hand, if future observations do not confirm this
long modulation in Sgr A*'s spectrum, this would be an indication that either
the disk size or orientation is very different from current estimates, or that
the black hole is not spinning at all (unlikely), or that our current
understanding of how it produces its radiative output is incorrect.

detached and the mass loss from the system comes from the stellar wind of a
massive helium star, of which only a fraction that allows for the observed
X-ray luminosity is accreted, or ii) the system is semidetached and a
Roche-lobe-overflowing low- or moderate-mass helium donor transfers mass to the
compact object, followed by ejection of its excess over the Eddington rate from

the expansion history of the universe and dark energy. Key to this program is
the means to localize the primordial features in observations of galaxy spectra
which necessarily involve galaxy bias, non-linear evolution and redshift space
distortions. We present calculations, based on mock catalogues produced from
particle-mesh simulations, which show the range of behaviors we might expect of
galaxies in the real universe. We find that non-linearity, galaxy bias and
redshift space distortions all introduce important modifications to the basic

lead to relatively smooth modulations in power on the scales of interest to
baryon oscillations. The halo and galaxy power spectra exhibit low order

condition $\mu_n=\mu_p+2\mu_e$ which results from the equality of electron and
positron capture rates in the hot electron-positron plasma with nucleons is
also found, if the matter is transparent to neutrinos. This simple analytic
formula is valid only if electrons are nondegenerate or mildly degenerate,
which is generally satisfied in the hot electron-positron plasma. Therefore, it
can be used to efficiently determine the steady state of the hot matter with
plenty of positrons. Based on this analytic condition, given the baryon number
density and the temperature, if the nucleons are nondegenerate, only one
algebraic equation for determining the electron fraction is obtained, which
shows the great advantage of the analytic equilibrium condition.

magnetorotational instability (MRI) is investigated also for small magnetic
Prandtl numbers. For rotating outer cylinder beyond the Rayleigh line
characteristic minima are found for magnetic Reynolds number of the order of 10
and for Lundquist numbers of order 1. The inclusion of extra toroidal
current-free fields leads to new oscillating solutions with rather low Reynolds
numbers and Hartmann numbers. The Hall effect establishes an unexpected
`shear-Hall instability' (SHI) where shear and magnetic field have opposite
signs. In this case even rotation laws increasing outwards may become unstable.
Recently global solutions have been found for the Taylor-Couette flows with
density stratified in axial directions (`stratorotational instability', SRI).
They exist beyond the Rayleigh line for Froude numbers of moderate order but
also not for too flat rotation laws with \hat\eta^2 < \hat\mu <\hat \eta.

configuration i.e. a classical Jacobi ellipsoid of equal mass and axes. In
addition, further constraints are established on the amount of residual
velocity anisotropy along the principal axes, for triaxial configurations.
Special effort is devoted to investigating sequences of virial equilibrium
configurations in terms of normalized parameters, including the effects of both
density and velocity profile. In particular, it is shown that bifurcation
points from axisymmetric to triaxial configurations occur as in classical
Jacobi ellipsoids, contrary to earlier results. The reasons of the above
mentioned discrepancy are also explained. An interpretation of recent results
from numerical simulations on stability (Meza 2002), is provided in the light
of the model. A physical interpretation of the early Hubble sequence is shortly
reviewed and discussed from the standpoint of the model, according if
elliptical galaxies are considered as isolated systems or embedded within dark
matter haloes. In any case, a lower limit to the flattening of oblate-like
configurations is established. On the other hand, it is found no lower limit to
the elongation of prolate-like configurations, and observed lack of elliptical
galaxies more elongated than E7 needs a different physical interpretation, such
as the fully investigated bending instabilities.

depth depends strongly on the optical properties ofthe H2O ice layers (for

the findings of Chiang et al. (2003), who showed that Neptune's migration into
a previously stirred-up Kuiper Belt can account for the Kuiper Belt Objects
(KBOs) known to librate at Neptune's 5:2 resonance. We also find that capture
is possible at many other weak, high-order mean motion resonances, such as the
11:6, 13:7, 13:6, 9:4, 7:3, 12:5, 8:3, 3:1, 7:2, and the 4:1. The more distant
of these resonances, such as the 9:4, 7:3, 5:2, and the 3:1, can also capture
particles in stable, eccentric orbits beyond 50 AU, in the region of phase
space conventionally known as the Scattered Disk. Indeed, 90% of the simulated
particles that persist over the age of the Solar System in the so-called
Scattered Disk zone never had a close encounter with Neptune, but instead were
promoted into these eccentric orbits by Neptune's resonances during the
migration epoch. This indicates that the observed Scattered Disk might not be
so scattered. This model also produced only a handful of Centaurs, all of which
originated at Neptune's mean motion resonances in the Kuiper Belt. We also
report estimates of the abundances and masses of the Belt's various
subpopulations (e.g., the resonant KBOs, the Main Belt, and the so-called
Scattered Disk), and also provide upper limits on the abundance of Centaurs and

X-ray spectrum can be modeled by a highly absorbed power law plus an Fe Kalpha
emission line. The iron line is broad, suggesting possible superposition of a
neutral iron line at 6.4 keV, and a blend of ionized iron lines from Fe XXV and
Fe XXVI. Given the relatively short exposure, the three line components can not
be singularly resolved with high statistical significance: the neutral
component is detected at ~2.5sigma and the Fe XXV line at ~2sigma c.l., while
for the Fe XXVI line we can only estimate an upper limit. The broad band
spectrum requires, in addition to a highly absorbed power law, at least three
collisionally ionized plasma components, which may be associated with
star-forming regions. The temperatures of the three plasmas are about 0.3, 0.8
and 6 keV, where the highest of the three is sufficient to produce ionized iron
emission lines. An alternative interpretation for the origin of the soft
emission might also be given in terms of reflection off some photoionized gas,
as has been observed in a number of nearby Compton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxies. A
hot gas, photoionized by the primary, continuum can also produce ionized iron
lines. Unfortunately, given the limited statistics and the lack of high
resolution spectroscopy, it is not possible to distinguish between the two
models investigated. We further compare the XMM-Newton findings with the
Chandra data obtaining consistent spectral results. The absorption corrected
hard X-ray (2-10 keV) luminosity of Mrk 273 corresponds to ~0.2% of the far-IR
luminosity, similar to typical values found in pure starbursts. The thermal
contribution to the soft X-ray luminosity is ~0.2-0.7x10^42 erg s^-1,
comparable to those found in NGC 6240 and other starburst dominated ULIRGs.

Estimates of the Fermi-surface averaged electron-phonon matrix element and
Hopfield parameter are obtained in the rigid ion approximation of Gaspari and
Gyorffy [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 28} (1972) 801]. The contribution of the lithium
atoms to the electron-phonon coupling is found to be negligible, while both
boron and palladium atoms contribute equally strongly to the Hopfield
parameter. There is a significant transfer of charge from lithium, almost the
entire valence charge, to the B-Pd(Pt) complex. The electronic structure and
superconducting properties of Li$_2$Pd$_3$B, thus, can be understood from the
viewpoint of the compound being composed of a connected array of B-Pd
tetrahedra decoupled from the backbone of Li atoms, which are connected by
relatively short bonds. Our results suggest that conventional s-wave
electron-phonon interaction without explicit consideration of SO coupling can
explain qualitatively the observed $T_c$ in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B. However, such an
approach is likely to fail to describe superconductivity in Li$_2$Pt$_3$B.

Maxwell type. It may describe the molecular elasticity effects in mono-domain
flows of liquid crystalline polymers as well as the viscoelastic effects in
suspensions of uniaxially symmetric particles in polymer fluids. Along with
viscoelastic and nematic kinematics, the theory employs a general form of
weakly elastic thermodynamic potential and the Leslie-Ericksen-Parodi type
constitutive equations for viscous nematic liquids, while ignoring inertia
effects and the Frank (orientation) elasticity in liquid crystal polymers. In
general case, even the simplest Maxwell model has many basic parameters.
Nevertheless, recently discovered algebraic properties of nematic operations
reveal a general structure of the theory and present it in a simple form. It is
shown that the evolution equation for director is also viscoelastic. An example
of magnetization exemplifies the action of non-symmetric stresses. When the
magnetic field is absent, the theory is simplified to the symmetric, fluid
mechanical case with relaxation properties for both the stress and director.
Our recent analyses of elastic and viscous soft deformation modes are also
extended to the viscoelastic case. The occurrence of possible soft modes
minimizes both the free energy and dissipation, and also significantly
decreases the number of material parameters. In symmetric linear case, the
theory is explicitly presented in terms of anisotropic linear memory
functionals. Several analytical results demonstrate a rich behavior predicted
by the developed model for steady and unsteady flows in simple shearing and
simple elongation.

the phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling for various lattice
parameters, and superconducting transition temperatures are obtained from the
Eliashberg equation. In both bct and fcc phases the superconducting transition
temperature T$_c$ is found to decrease with increasing pressure, due to
stiffening of phonons with an accompanying decrease in electron-phonon
coupling. This is in contrast to a recent report, where T$_c$ is found to
increase with pressure. Even more drastic is the difference between the
measured T$_c$, in the range 4-11 K, and the calculated values for both bct and
fcc phases, in the range 60-100 K. The calculation reveals that the transition
from the fcc to bct phase, as a result of increasing volume or decreasing
pressure, is caused by the softening of the X-point transverse phonons. This
phonon softening also causes large electron-phonon coupling for high volumes in
the fcc phase, resulting in coupling constants in excess of 2.5 and T$_c$
nearing 100 K. We discuss possible causes as to why the experiment might have
revealed T$_c$'s much lower than what is suggested by the present study. The
main assertion of this paper is that the possibility of high T$_c$, in excess

rotating the basis in the vertical plane, we have determined the evolution of
the stress distribution as a function of the basis inclination using Finite
Elements method with an elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive model, defined
by its friction angle, without cohesion. It is found that when the yield
function is the Drucker-Prager one, stress distribution satisfying equilibrium
can be found even when one of the free-surface slopes is larger than the
friction angle. This means that piles with a slope larger than the friction
angle can be (at least) marginally stable and that slope rotation is not always
a destabilising perturbation direction. On the contrary, it is found that the
slope cannot overpass the friction angle when a Mohr-Coulomb yield function is
used. Theoretical explanation of these facts is given which enlightens the role
plaid by the intermediate principal stress in both cases of the Mohr-Coulomb
criterion and of the Drucker-Prager one. It is then argued that the
Mohr-Coulomb criterion assumes a spontaneous symmetry breaking, as soon as the
two smallest principal stresses are different ; this is not physical most
likely; so this criterion shall be replaced by a Drucker-Prager criterion in
the vicinity of the equality, which leads to the previous anomalous behaviour ;
so these numerical computations enlighten the avalanche process: they show that
no dynamical angle larger than the static one is needed to understand
avalanching. It is in agreement with previous experimental results.
Furthermore, these results show that the maximum angle of repose can be
modified using cyclic rotations; we propose a procedure that allows to achieve
a maximum angle of repose to be equal to the friction angle .

on the range of small and intermediate deformation when the medium can dilate
if it is dense; different specific typical tests (oedometric, constant
pressure, constant volume) are defined, the behaviours they lead are carefully
described and their dependences upon initial density recalled. Roles of
friction and dilatancy are exemplified and their link with the deviatoric
stress too. ""Natural"" ""phase space"" is defined, which is (specific volume, mean
pressure, axial or deviatoric stress). Then the ""critical"" state, the
""characteristic"" state and the Rowe's law of dilatancy are defined, and the
previous behaviours analysed in term of plastic deformation, showing that these
behaviours obey a specific rule of dissipation. An isotropic incremental
modelling is then proposed and studied, with a pseudo Poisson coefficient that
evolves with the stress ratio. It shows a good agreement with experimental
trends, while the theory keeps simple, which describes in particular the
isochoric compression and the oedometric compression correctly. Cyclic
behaviours are then described, and their link with soil liquefaction, with a
peculiar attention to the role of stress ratio. Basic concepts on micro-macro

can render vacuum fluctuations the appearance of thermal radiance in the

afar. Two basic questions are addressed in this study: a) How are vacuum
fluctuations related to the emitted radiation? b) Is there emitted radiation
with energy flux in the Unruh effect? We adopt a method which places the
detector and the field on an equal footing and derive the two-point correlation
functions of the detector and of the field separately with full account of
their interplay. From the exact solutions, we are able to study the complete
process from the initial transient to the final steady state, keeping track of
all activities they engage in and the physical effects manifested. We derive a
quantum radiation formula for a Minkowski observer. We find that there does
exist a positive radiated power of quantum nature emitted by the detector, with
a hint of certain features of the Unruh effect. We further verify that the
total energy of the dressed detector and a part of the radiated energy from the
detector is conserved. However, this part of the radiation ceases in steady
state. So the hint of the Unruh effect in radiated power is actually not
directly from the energy flux that the detector experiences in Unruh effect.
Since all the relevant quantum and statistical information about the detector
(atom) and the field can be obtained from the results presented here, they are
expected to be useful, when appropriately generalized, for addressing issues of
quantum information processing in atomic and optical systems, such as quantum
decoherence, entanglement and teleportation.

staggered quark Dirac operators on quenched lattice QCD gluon backgrounds
generated using a Symanzik-improved gluon action. For the improved Dirac
operators we find a clear separation of the spectrum into would-be zero modes
and others. The number of would-be zero modes depends on the topological charge
as predicted by the continuum Index Theorem, and the expectation values of
their chirality are large for the most improved actions (approx 0.7). The
remaining modes have low chirality and show clear signs of clustering into
quartets that become degenerate in the continuum limit. We demonstrate that the
lattice spacing and volume dependence of the eigenvalues follow expectations.
Furthermore, the non-zero modes follow the random matrix theory predictions for
all topological charge sectors. The values of the chiral condensate extracted
from fits to the theoretical distributions are consistent with each other, and
with the results obtained from the total density of eigenvalues using the

  Fluid dynamicists believe that Navier-Stokes equations accurately describe
turbulence. A mathematical proof on the global regularity of the solutions to
the Navier-Stokes equations is a very challenging problem. Such a proof or
disproof does not solve the problem of turbulence. It may help understanding
turbulence. Turbulence is more of a dynamical system problem. Studies on chaos
in partial differential equations indicate that turbulence can have Bernoulli
shift dynamics which results in the wandering of a turbulent solution in a fat
domain in the phase space. Thus, turbulence can not be averaged. The hope is
that turbulence can be controlled.

presented. Empirical local congested traffic states in single vehicle data
measured on different days are classified into synchronized flow states and
states consisting of synchronized flow and wide moving jam(s). Then empirical
microscopic characteristics for these different local congested traffic states
are studied. Using these characteristics and empirical spatiotemporal
macroscopic traffic phenomena, an empirical test of a microscopic three-phase
traffic flow theory is performed. Simulations show that the microscopic
criterion and macroscopic spatiotemporal objective criteria lead to the same
identification of the synchronized flow and wide moving jam phases in congested
traffic. It is found that microscopic three-phase traffic models can explain
both microscopic and macroscopic empirical congested pattern features. It is
obtained that microscopic distributions for vehicle speed difference as well as
fundamental diagrams and speed correlation functions can depend on the spatial
co-ordinate considerably. It turns out that microscopic optimal velocity (OV)
functions and time headway distributions are not necessarily qualitatively
different, even if local congested traffic states are qualitatively different.
The reason for this is that important spatiotemporal features of congested
traffic patterns are it lost in these as well as in many other macroscopic and
microscopic traffic characteristics, which are widely used as the empirical
basis for a test of traffic flow models, specifically, cellular automata
traffic flow models.

and make a very peculiar assignment between coordinates and physical distances
and time. I assume there is an hyperspherical symmetry which is made apparent
by assigning the hypersphere radius to proper time and distances on the
hypersphere to usual 3-dimensional distances. Time, or Compton time to
distinguish from cosmic time is the 0th coordinate and I am able to project
everything into 4-dimensions by imposing a null displacement condition.
Surprisingly nothing else is needed to explain Hubble's expansion law without
any appeal to dark matter; an empty Universe will expand naturally at a flat
rate in this way. I then discuss the perturbative effects of a small mass
density in the expansion rate in a qualitative way; quantitative results call
for the solution of equations that sometimes have not even been clearly
formulated and so are deferred to later work. A brief outlook of the
consequences an hyperspherical symmetry has for galaxy dynamics allows the
derivation of constant rotation velocity curves, again without appealing to

research area with many fundamental properties still not well understood.
Already several intriguing applications have developed, like HOMOGENIZED and
IDEAL spectroscopy, that allow high resolution spectra to be obtained in
inhomogeneous fields, such as in-vivo. The theoretical and experimental
research in this thesis concentrates on the fundamental signal properties of
DDF-based sequences in the presence of relaxation (T1 and T2) and diffusion. A
general introduction to magnetic resonance phenomenon is followed by a more in
depth introduction to the DDF and its effects. A novel analytical signal
equation has been developed to describe the effects of T2 relaxation and
diffusing spatially modulated longitudinal spins during the signal build period
of an HOMOGENIZED cross peak. Diffusion of the longitudinal spins results in a
lengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time, delaying the
re-phasing of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture. In the
classical picture the unwinding rate of spatially twisted magnetization is no
longer constant, but decays exponentially with time. The expression is
experimentally verified for the HOMOGENIZED spectrum of 100mM TSP in H2O at
4.7T. Equations have also been developed for the case of multiple repetition
steady state 1d and 2d spectroscopic sequences with incomplete magnetization
recovery, leading to spatially varying longitudinal magnetization. Experimental
verification has been accomplished by imaging the profile. The equations should

  pressure at the boundary surface","28 pages de texte",,,,"physics.class-ph",,"  Here we investigate the practical feasibility of performing soundfield
reproduction throughout a three-dimensional area by controlling the acoustic
pressure measured at the boundary surface of the volume in question. The main
aim is to obtain quantitative data showing what performances a practical
implementation of this strategy is likely to yield. In particular, the
influence of two main limitations is studied, namely the spatial aliasing and
the resonance problems occurring at the eigenfrequencies associated with the
internal Dirichlet problem. The strategy studied is first approached by
performing numerical simulations, and then in experiments involving active
noise cancellation inside a sphere in an anechoic environment. The results show
that noise can be efficiently cancelled everywhere inside the sphere in a wide
frequency range, in the case of both pure tones and broadband noise, including
cases where the wavelength is similar to the diameter of the sphere. Excellent
agreement was observed between the results of the simulations and the
measurements. This method can be expected to yield similar performances when it
is used to reproduce soundfields.

  Control Design and DNA Pooling",,"Biostatistics (2007) 8:546--565","10.1093/biostatistics/kxl028",,"q-bio.GN q-bio.PE q-bio.QM",,"  This paper describes a Bayesian statistical method for determining the
genetic basis of a complex genetic trait. The method uses a sample of unrelated
individuals classified into two groups, for example cases and controls. Each
group is assumed to have been genotyped at a battery of marker loci using a
laboratory effort efficient technique called DNA pooling. The aim is to detect
and map a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that is not one of the typed markers.
The method works by conducting an exact Bayesian analysis under a number of
simplifying population genetic assumptions that are somewhat unrealistic.
Despite this, the method is shown to perform acceptably on datasets simulated
under a more realistic model, and furthermore is shown to outperform classical
single point methods.

A 72, 062314 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.062314",,"quant-ph",,"  It is known that quantum correlations exhibited by a maximally entangled
qubit pair can be simulated with the help of shared randomness, supplemented
with additional resources, such as communication, post-selection or non-local
boxes. For instance, in the case of projective measurements, it is possible to
solve this problem with protocols using one bit of communication or making one
use of a non-local box. We show that this problem reduces to a distributed
sampling problem. We give a new method to obtain samples from a biased
distribution, starting with shared random variables following a uniform
distribution, and use it to build distributed sampling protocols. This approach
allows us to derive, in a simpler and unified way, many existing protocols for
projective measurements, and extend them to positive operator value
measurements. Moreover, this approach naturally leads to a local hidden
variable model for Werner states.
