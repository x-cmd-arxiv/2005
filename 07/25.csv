sampled data based on binary space partitioning tree. We start with a root node
containing all the particles and then recursively divide each node into two
nodes each containing roughly equal number of particles,until each of the nodes
contains only one particle. The volume of such a leaf node provides an estimate
of the local density. We implement an entropy-based node splitting criterion
that results in a significant improvement in the estimation of densities
compared to earlier work. The method is completely metric free and can be
applied to arbitrary number of dimensions. We apply this method to determine
the phase space densities of dark matter halos obtained from cosmological
N-body simulations. We find that contrary to earlier studies, the volume
distribution function $v(f)$ of phase space density $f$ does not have a
constant slope but rather a small hump at high phase space densities. We
demonstrate that a model in which a halo is made up by a superposition of
Hernquist spheres is not capable in explaining the shape of $v(f)$ vs $f$
relation, whereas a model which takes into account the contribution of the main
halo separately roughly reproduces the behavior as seen in simulations. The use
of the presented method is not limited to calculation of phase space densities,
but can be used as a general-purpose data-mining tool and due to its speed and
accuracy it is ideally suited for analysis of large multidimensional data sets.

influence of initial metallicity and initial mass on the mass loss and

are identified by their reddened near-IR colours and thermal-IR dust excess
emission. Most of these objects are Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) carbon stars
in intermediate-age clusters, with progenitor masses between 1.3 and about 5
Msun. Red supergiants with circumstellar dust envelopes are found in young
clusters, and have progenitor masses between 13 and 20 Msun. Post-AGB objects
(e.g., Planetary Nebulae) and massive stars with detached envelopes and/or hot
central stars are found in several clusters. We model the spectral energy
distributions of the cluster IR objects to estimate their bolometric
luminosities and mass-loss rates. The IR objects are the most luminous cluster
objects, and have luminosities as expected for their initial mass and
metallicity. They experience mass-loss rates in the range from a few 1e-6 up to
1e-4 Msun/yr (or more), with most of the spread being due to evolutionary
effects and only a weak dependence on progenitor mass and/or initial
metallicity. About half of the mass lost by 1.3--3 Msun stars is shed during
the superwind phase, which lasts of order 1e5 yr. Objects with detached shells
are found to have experienced the highest mass-loss rates, and are therefore
interpreted as post-superwind objects. We also propose a simple method to

investigate the resulting multi-frequency signals, from radio to gamma-ray

annihilations, like the DM-induced Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the
intracluster gas heating. As for the particle physics setup, we adopt a
two-fold approach, resorting both to model-independent bottom-up scenarios and
to benchmark, GUT-motivated frameworks. We show that the Coma radio-halo data
(the spectrum and the surface brightness) can be nicely fitted by the
neutralino-induced signal for peculiar particle physics models and for magnetic
field values, which we outline in detail. Fitting the radio data and moving to
higher frequencies, we find that the multi-frequency spectral energy
distributions are typically dim (with respect to the data) at EUV and X-ray
frequencies, but show a non-negligible gamma-ray emission, depending on the
amplitude of the Coma magnetic field. The best-fit particle physics models also
produce a detectable SZ effect, but do not yield substantial heating of the
intracluster gas in Coma. Due to the specific multi-frequency features of the
DM-induced spectral energy distribution in Coma, we find that supersymmetric
models can be significantly and optimally constrained either in the gamma-rays

comprised of point ions moving on a potential energy surface. In the classical

solid. In a small local quantum domain the potential is determined from a
detailed quantum calculation of the electronic structure. The primary new
ingredients are 1) a determination of the pair potential from quantum data for
equilibrium and strained structures, 2) development of pseudo-atoms for a
realistic treatment of charge densities where bonds have been broken to define
the quantum domain, and 3) inclusion of polarization effects on the quantum
domain due to its environment. This formal structure is illustrated in detail
for an silica nanorod. For each configuration considered, the charge density of
the entire solid is calculated quantum mechanically to provide the reference by
which to judge the accuracy of the modeling.It is then shown that the quantum
rod, the rod constructed from the classical pair potentials, and the composite

a crossover from tunneling to activated behavior in the low-voltage region of

contacts. We study electron transport in single- and double-wall CNTs contacted
to metallic electrodes within the Landauer formalism combined with Green

to blocking of a transport channel. In the case of double-wall CNTs with both
inner and outer shells being metallic, non-diagonal self energy contributions
from the electrodes may induce channel mixing, precluding a simple addition of
the individual shell conductances.

the perimeter segments and of the angles between adjoining segments: to leading
order as $n\to\infty$, and after appropriate scaling, these become independent
random variables whose laws we determine; and to next order in $1/n$ they have
nontrivial long range correlations whose expressions we provide. The $n$-sided
cell tends towards a circle of radius $(n/4\pi\lambda)^{\half}$, where
$\lambda$ is the cell density; hence Lewis' law for the average area $A\_n$ of
the $n$-sided cell behaves as $A\_n \simeq cn/\lambda$ with $c=1/4$. For
$n\to\infty$ the cell perimeter, expressed as a function $R(\phi)$ of the polar
angle $\phi$, satisfies $d^2 R/d\phi^2 = F(\phi)$, where $F$ is known Gaussian

cosmology, the expansion law is modified from the four-dimensional standard
cosmological one at high temperature regime in the early universe. As a result,
the well-known upper bound on the lightest light neutrino mass induced by the
condition for the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest heavy neutrino,
$\tilde{m}_1 \lesssim 10^{-3}$ eV, can be moderated to be $\tilde{m}_1 \lesssim
10^{-3} {eV} \times (M_1/T_t)^2 $ in the case of $T_t \leq M_1$ with the
lightest heavy neutrino mass ($M_1$) and the ``transition temperature''
($T_t$), at which the modified expansion law in brane world cosmology is
smoothly connecting with the standard one. This implies that the degenerate
mass spectrum of the light neutrinos can be consistent with the thermal
leptogenesis scenario. Furthermore, as recently pointed out, the gravitino
problem in supersymmetric case can be solved if the transition temperature is
low enough $T_t \lesssim 10^{6-7}$ GeV. Therefore, even in the supersymmetric

assertion that the correct quantum theory of gravity must be background
independent. We begin by recounting how the debate over whether quantum gravity
must be background independent is a continuation of a long-standing argument in
the history of physics and philosophy over whether space and time are
relational or absolute. This leads to a careful statement of what physicists
mean when we speak of background independence. Given this we can characterize
the precise sense in which general relativity is a background independent
theory. The leading background independent approaches to quantum gravity are
then discussed, including causal set models, loop quantum gravity and dynamical
triangulations and their main achievements are summarized along with the
problems that remain open. Some first attempts to cast string/M theory into a
background independent formulation are also mentioned.
  The relational/absolute debate has implications also for other issues such as
unification and how the parameters of the standard models of physics and
cosmology are to be explained. The recent issues concerning the string theory
landscape are reviewed and it is argued that they can only be resolved within
the context of a background independent formulation. Finally, we review some
recent proposals to make quantum theory more relational.

brane scalar field $\phi$ representing matter on the brane. The bulk field
$\Psi$ is assumed to have a light mode, whose mass depends on the expectation
value of $\phi$. To estimate the effects from the KK modes, we compute the
1-loop effective potential $V_\eff(\phi)$. With no tuning of the parameters of
the model, the vacuum becomes (meta)stable -- $V_\eff(\phi)$ develops a true
vacuum at a nonzero $\phi$. In the true vacuum, the light mode of $\Psi$
becomes heavy, degenerates with the KK modes and decays. We comment on some
implications for the bulk inflaton model. Also, we clarify some aspects of the
renormalization procedure in the thin wall approximation, and show that the

orders on Young tableaux. The first order is obtained from induced Duflo order
by the extension with the help of Vogan T_{\alpha, \beta} procedure. We call it
Duflo-Vogan order. The second order is obtained from the generalization of
Spaltenstein's construction by consideration of an orbital variety as a double
chain of nilpotent orbits. We call it the chain order. Again, we use Vogan's
T_{\alpha, \beta} procedure, however, this time to restrict the chain order. We
call it Vogan-chain order. The order on Young tableaux defined by the inclusion
of orbital variety closures is called a geometric order and the order on Young
tableaux defined by inverse inclusion of primitive ideals is called an
algebraic order.
  We get the following relations between the orders: Duflo-Vogan order is an
extension of the induced Duflo order; the algebraic order is an extension of
Duflo-Vogan order; the geometric order is an extension of the algebraic order;
Vogan-chain order is an extension of the geometric order; and, finally, the
chain order is an extension of Vogan-chain order. The computationsshow that
Duflo-Vogan and Vogan-chain orders coincide on sl_n for n<10 and in n=10 there
is one case (up to T_{\alpha,\beta} procedure and transposition) where
Vogan-chain order is a proper extension of Duflo-Vogan order. In this only case
the algebraic order coincides with Vogan-chain order. These computations permit
us to conjecture that in sl_n the algebraic order coincides with the geometric
order. As well we conjecture that the combinatorics of both the inclusions on
primitive ideals and on orbital variety closures is defined by Vogan-chain
order on Young tableaux.

  subspaces",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The hardness to solve an unstructured quantum search problem by a standard
quantum search algorithm mainly originates from the low efficiency to amplify
the amplitude of the marked state by the oracle unitary operation associated
with other known quantum operations. In order to bypass the square speedup
limitation of a standard quantum search algorithm it is necessary to develop
other type of quantum search algorithms. It is described in detail in the paper
for a quantum dynamical method to solve the quantum search problems in the
cyclic group state space. The binary dynamical representation for a quantum
state in the Hilbert space of the n-qubit quantum system is generalized to the
multi-base dynamical representation for a quantum state in the cyclic group
state space. Thus, any quantum state in the cyclic group state space may be
described completely in terms of a set of dynamical parameters that are closely
related to the symmetric property and structure of the cyclic group. The
quantum search problem therefore could be solved by determining the set of
dynamical parameters that describe completely the unknown marked state of the
search problem instead by directly measuring the marked state which is a
necessary step in the standard quantum search algorithm. An unstructured
quantum search problem in the Hilbert space is inevitably affected greatly by
the symmetric property and structure of a group. The main attempt of the paper
is to make use of the symmetric properties and structures of groups to help
solving the quantum search problems in the group state spaces. It is shown how
the quantum search process could be reduced from the cyclic group state space
to these cyclic group state subspaces with the help of the symmetric property
and structure of the cyclic group on a universal quantum computer.

A 72, 052306 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.052306",,"quant-ph",,"  We address a problem of identifying a given pure state with one of two
reference pure states, when no classical knowledge on the reference states is
given, but a certain number of copies of them are available. We assume the
input state is guaranteed to be either one of the two reference states. This
problem, which we call quantum pure state identification, is a natural
generalization of the standard state discrimination problem. The two reference
states are assumed to be independently distributed in a unitary invariant way
in the whole state space. We give a complete solution for the averaged maximal
success probability of this problem for an arbitrary number of copies of the
reference states in general dimension. It is explicitly shown that the obtained
mean identification probability approaches the mean discrimination probability
as the number of the reference copies goes to infinity.

atoms. The system combines optical telecommunications components and frequency
doubling to generate light at 780 nm. Using a fast, fibre-coupled intensity
modulator, output from a continuous laser diode is sliced into pulses with a
length between 1.3 and 6.1 ns and a repetition frequency of 5 MHz. These pulses
are amplified using an erbium-doped fibre amplifier, and frequency-doubled in a
periodically poled lithium niobate crystal, yielding a peak power up to 12 W.
Using the resulting light at 780 nm, we demonstrate Rabi oscillations on the F
