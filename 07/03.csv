weight lies in the Drude peak, $\sigma(\omega) = D\delta(\omega)+ \sigma_{\rm

calculations at $\omega = 0$ even for finite chain lengths. Adding the
impurity, the main peak is shifted to finite frequencies proportional to the
impurity strength. The shift indicates the energy gap of the disturbed finite
size system, also in the interacting system. Thus, we can pursue in the optical
conductivity for finite metallic systems the energy gap. However, due to level
crossing, the impurity-induced peak arises in the interacting system first when
a certain impurity strength is exceeded. In the Mott insulating phase, the
impurity leads to an impurity state within the gap.

DSS solution bifurcates from the first CSS excitation in a heteroclinic loop
bifurcation. We study critical phenomena between dispersal and singularity
formation (at very small couplings) respectively black hole formation (for
larger couplings). We give numerical evidence that for very small couplings the

SO(10) that needs the Higgs representations $126+\bar 126$ the GUT-gauge

perturbative up the Planck scale(=2x10^{18} GeV), the scale $M_U$ of GUT
symmetry breaking is to be bounded from below. The bound depends upon specific
Higgs representations used for SO(10) symmetry breaking but, as we find, can
not be lower than $1.5x10^{17}$ GeV. In order to obtain such high unification
scale we propose a two-step SO(10) breaking through
$SU(2)_LXSU(2)_RXU(1)_{B-L}XSU(3)_C(g_{2L} \neq g_{2R})$ intermediate gauge
symmetry. We estimate potential threshold and gravitational corrections to the
running of gauge couplings and show that they can make the picture of
perturbative GUT- gauge coupling running consistent at least up to the Planck
scale. We also show that when $SO(10) \to G_{2213}$ by $210 + 54$,
gravitational corrections alone with negligible threshold effects may guarantee
such perturbative gauge coupling. The lifetime of the proton is found to
increase by nearly 6 orders over the current experimental limit for $p \to

lifetimes is possible extending from the current experimental limit up to

tool in computational statistics. These algorithms approximate a sequence of
distributions by a sequence of weighted empirical measures associated to a
weighted population of particles. These particles and weights are generated
recursively according to elementary transformations: mutation and selection.
Examples of applications include the sequential Monte-Carlo techniques to solve
optimal non-linear filtering problems in state-space models, molecular
simulation, genetic optimization, etc.
  Despite many theoretical advances the asymptotic property of these
approximations remains of course a question of central interest. In this paper,
we analyze sequential Monte Carlo methods from an asymptotic perspective, that
is, we establish law of large numbers and invariance principle as the number of
particles gets large. We introduce the concepts of ""weighted sample""
consistency and asymptotic normality, and derive conditions under which the
mutation and the selection procedure used in the sequential Monte-Carlo
build-up preserve these properties. To illustrate our findings, we analyze SMC
algorithms to approximate the filtering distribution in state-space models. We
show how our techniques allow to relax restrictive technical conditions used in
previously reported works and provide grounds to analyze more sophisticated
sequential sampling strategies.

applications are extended by applying linear participant scaling to the
space-time parameters of the model while keeping all other parameters fixed.
This allows us to predict HBT radii over a range of centralities for both Au+Au
and Cu+Cu collisions. Good agreement is found with STAR HBT data for all but
the most peripheral collisions.

effects in the Brown-Rho (BR) scaled lagrangian model in a mean field theory.
The lagrangian density discussed in this work requires less parameters than the
usual models with density dependent couplings. We also present the formalism
with the inclusion of the eight lightest baryons, two lightest leptons, beta
equilibrium and charge neutrality in order to apply the BR scaled model to the
study of neutron stars. The results are again compared with the ones obtained
from another density dependent parametrization model. The role played by the
rearrangement term at T=0 for nuclear or neutron star matter and at finite
temperature is investigated. The BR scaled model is shown to be a good tool in
studies involving density dependent effective masses and in astrophysics
applications.

equilateral triangular cross section and refractive index n, surrounded by a
uniform medium of refractive index n'. The field confinement is determined only
under the requirements needed to maintain total internal reflection of the
internal electromagnetic fields, matched to exponentially decaying evanescent
waves outside the cavity. Two-dimensional electromagnetics is considered, with
no dependence on the coordinate perpendicular to the cross section; hence,
independent transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarizations
are described separately. A linear combination of six plane waves is sufficient
within the cavity, whose wavevectors are related by 120-degree rotations and
whose phases are related by Fresnel reflection coefficients. Generally, the
mode spectrum becomes sparse and the minimum mode frequency increases rapidly
as the index ratio N=n/n' approaches 2. For specified quantum numbers and N,
the TM modes are lower in frequency than the TE modes. Assuming the evanescent
boundary waves escape at the triangle vertices, TE modes generally are found to
have greater confinement of the fields inside the cavity and much higher
quality factors than TM modes.

been described as a power-law distribution. While the degree distribution does
not capture all aspects of a network, it has often been suggested that its
functional form contains important clues as to underlying evolutionary
processes that have shaped the network. Generally, the functional form for the
degree distribution has been determined in an ad-hoc fashion, with clear
power-law like behaviour often only extending over a limited range of
connectivities. Here we apply formal model selection techniques to decide which
probability distribution best describes the degree distributions of protein
interaction networks. Contrary to previous studies this well defined approach
suggests that the degree distribution of many molecular networks is often
better described by distributions other than the popular power-law
distribution. This, in turn, suggests that simple, if elegant, models may not
necessarily help in the quantitative understanding of complex biological
processes.\

system (s=1/2), we explicitly construct a reversing measurement and evaluate
the degree of reversibility in terms of fidelity. The recovery of the measured
state is pronounced when the probe has a high spin (j>1/2), because the
fidelity changes drastically during the reversible measurement and the
reversing measurement. We also show that the reversing measurement scheme for a
spin-1/2 system can serve as an experimentally feasible approximate reversing
measurement for a high-spin system (s>1/2). If the interaction is sufficiently
weak, the reversing measurement can recover a cat state almost
deterministically in spite of there being a large fidelity change.
