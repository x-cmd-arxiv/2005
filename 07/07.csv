with supermassive black holes (called extreme mass ratio inspirals, or EMRIs)
focus on two-body capture by emission of gravitational radiation. The
gravitational wave signal of such events will likely involve a significant
eccentricity in the sensitivity range of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). We show that tidal separation of stellar-mass compact object binaries
by supermassive black holes will instead produce events whose eccentricity is
nearly zero in the LISA band. Compared to two-body capture events, tidal
separations have a high cross section and result in orbits that have a large
pericenter and small apocenter. Therefore, the rate of interactions per binary
is high and the resulting systems are very unlikely to be perturbed by other
stars into nearly radial plunges. Depending on the fraction of compact objects
that are in binaries within a few parsecs of the center, the rate of
low-eccentricity LISA events could be comparable to or larger than the rate of
high-eccentricity events.

and the adsorption energy on ice is higher than on bare grain. The model also
predicts that the thickness of the mantle, and, hence, the optical thickness at

total amount of water in the gas. Chemical simulation was also used to

Dark Matter (LDM) particles could explain the flux and extension of the 511 keV
line emission in the galactic centre. Here we present a thorough comparison
between theoretical expectations of the galactic positron distribution within
the LDM scenario and observational data from INTEGRAL/SPI. Unlike previous
analyses, there is now enough statistical evidence to put tight constraints on
the shape of the dark matter halo of our galaxy, if the galactic positrons
originate from dark matter. For annihilating candidates, the best fit to the
observed 511 keV emission is provided by a radial density profile with inner
logarithmic slope gamma=1.03+-0.04. In contrast, decaying dark matter requires
a much steeper density profile, gamma>1.5, rather disfavoured by both
observations and numerical simulations. Within the annihilating LDM scenario, a
velocity-independent cross-section would be consistent with the observational
data while a cross-section purely proportional to v^2 can be rejected at a high
confidence level. Assuming the most simplistic model where the galactic
positrons are produced as primaries, we show that the LDM candidate should be a
scalar rather than a spin-1/2 particle and obtain a very stringent constraint
on the value of the positron production cross-section to explain the 511 keV
emission. One consequence is that the value of the fine structure constant
should differ from that recommended in the CODATA. This is a very strong test
for the LDM scenario and an additional motivation in favour of experiments
measuring alpha directly. Our results finally indicate that an accurate
measurement of the shape of the dark halo profile could have a tremendous
impact on the determination of the origin of the 511 keV line and vice versa.

role of major mergers in forming the stellar masses of modern galaxies based on
measurements of galaxy merger and star formation histories from z~0.5-3. We
re-construct the merger history of normal field galaxies from z~3 to z~0 as a
function of initial mass using published pair fractions and merger fractions
from structural analyses. We calibrate the observed merger time-scale and mass
ratios for galaxy mergers using self-consistent N-body models of mergers,
composed of dark matter and stars, with mass ratios from 1:1 to 1:5 with
various orbital properties and viewing angles. We use these simulations to
determine the time-scales and mass ratios that produce structures that would be
identified as major mergers. Based on these calculations we argue that a
typical massive galaxy at z~3 with M_{*} > 10^{10} M_0 undergoes
4.4^{+1.6}_{-0.9} major mergers at z > 1. We find that by z~1.5 the stellar
mass of an average massive galaxy is relatively established, a scenario
qualitatively favored in a lambda dominated universe. We argue that the final
masses of these systems increases by as much as a factor of 100 allowing
Lyman-break galaxies, which tend to have low stellar masses, to become the most
massive galaxies in today's universe with M > M^{*}. Induced star formation
however only accounts for 10-30% of the stellar mass formed in these galaxies
at z < 3. A comparison to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows that
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models consistently under-predict the merger fraction,
and rate of merging, of massive galaxies at high redshift. This suggests that
massive galaxy formation occurs through more merging than predicted in CDM
models, rather than a rapid early collapse.

  We find that active young Suns spend 70% of their time in a characteristic

temperatures kT_2 = 2.1 * kT_1. During characteristic periods, the 0.5-8 keV
X-ray luminosity is about 0.03% of the bolometric luminosity. One or two
powerful flares per week with peak luminosities logL_x ~ 30-32 erg/s are
typically superposed on this characteristic emission accompanied by heating of
the hot plasma component from ~2.4 keV to ~7 keV at the flare peak. The energy
distribution of flares superposed on the characteristic emission level follows
the relationship dN/dE ~ E^-1.7. The flare rates are consistent with the
production of sufficiently energetic protons to spawn a spallogenic origin of
some important short-lived radionuclides found in ancient meteorites. The
X-rays can ionize gas in the circumstellar disk at a rate of 6 10^-9

matter, and in addition its chemical content should be dominated by helium.
Here we study the evolutionary and structural properties of the mirror stars
which essentially are similar to that of the ordinary stars but with higher
helium contents. Being invisible in terms of photons, they could be observed
only as MACHOs in the microlensing experiments. Using a numerical code, we
compute evolution of stars with large helium abundances (Y = 0.30-0.80) and a
wide range of masses, from 0.5 to 10 solar masses. We found that helium
dominated mirror star should have much faster evolutionary time (up to a factor
30) than the ordinary star with the same mass. In addition, we show the
diagrams of luminosities, effective temperatures, central temperatures and
densities, and compute the masses of the He core at ignition and the minimum
mass for carbon ignition, for different chemical compositions. The general
conclusion is that mirror stars evolve faster as compared to ordinary ones, and
explode earlier as type II supernovae, thus enriching the galactic halo of
processed mirror gas with higher metallicity, with implications for MACHO
observations and galaxy evolution.

central line of sight velocity dispersion of 9.3 (+11.7 -1.2) km/s, with 95%
confidence that the dispersion is >6.5 km/s. Assuming that UMajor is in
dynamical equilibrium, it is clearly dark matter dominated, and cannot be a
purely stellar system like a globular cluster. It has an inferred central
mass-to-light ratio of M/L~500 and, based on our studies of other dSphs, may
possess a much larger total mass to light ratio. UMajor is unexpectedly massive
for its low luminosity -- indeed, UMajor appears to be the most dark-matter
dominated galaxy yet discovered. The presence of so much dark matter in UMajor
immediately suggests that it may be a member of the missing population of
low-mass galaxies predicted by the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm. Given the
weak correlation between dSph mass and luminosity, it is entirely likely that a
population of dark dwarfs surrounds our Galaxy.

insignificant effect on this bright young compact PN. The properties of the

clustering properties of the large-scale structures. Without confirmation from
Einstein's theory, however, it has been unclear whether we can rely on the
analysis, for example, near the horizon scale. In this work we will provide a
confirmation of using Newton's gravity in cosmology based on relativistic
analysis of weakly non-linear situations to the third order in perturbations.
We will show that, except for the gravitational wave contribution, the
relativistic zero-pressure fluid equations perturbed to the second order in a
flat Friedmann background coincide exactly with the Newtonian results. We will
also present the pure relativistic correction terms appearing in the third
order. The third-order correction terms show that these are the linear-order
curvature perturbation strength higher than the second-order
relativistic/Newtonian terms. Thus, the pure general relativistic corrections
in the third order are independent of the horizon scale and are small in the
large-scale due to the low-level temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave
background radiation. Since we include the cosmological constant, our results
are relevant to currently favoured cosmology. As we prove that the Newtonian
hydrodynamic equations are valid in all cosmological scales to the second
order, and that the third-order correction terms are small, our result has a
practically important implication that one can now use the large-scale
Newtonian numerical simulation more reliably as the simulation scale approaches
and even goes beyond the horizon.

important diagnostics of the interstellar and circumstellar medium (resp. ISM

most probably occuring in the local Galactic center medium and can be
associated with the individual sources. Moreover, turbulence seems to affect
the studied region of the minispiral which appears like a mixture of a dense

find three sources with broad lines corresponding to a FWHM deconvolved line
width of about 1100 km/s and moving towards us with a radial velocity of about
-300km/s. These sources are most probably new Wolf-Rayet type stars located in

spatial resolution and spectroscopic capability of ISO over its predecessor
Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), has enabled significant advances in the
understanding of the infrared properties of active galaxies. ISO surveyed a
wide range of active galaxies which, in the context of this review, includes
those powered by intense bursts of star-formation as well as those containing a
dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN). Mid infrared imaging resolved for the
first time the dust enshrouded nuclei in many nearby galaxies, while a new era
in infrared spectroscopy was opened by probing a wealth of atomic, ionic and
molecular lines as well as broad band features in the mid and far infrared.
This was particularly useful since it resulted in the understanding of the
power production, excitation and fuelling mechanisms in the nuclei of active
galaxies including the intriguing but so far elusive ultraluminous infrared
galaxies. Detailed studies of various classes of AGN and quasars greatly
improved our understanding of the unification scenario. Far-infrared imaging

very robust because they closely approximate a mass weighted dipole, bypassing

It is now well known that a combination of cosmological probes is required to
break the underlying degeneracies on cosmological parameters. In this paper, we
present a method, based on a frequentist approach, to combine probes without
any prior constraints, taking full account of the correlations in the
parameters. As an application, a combination of current SNIa and CMB data with
an evolving dark energy component is first compared to other analyses. We
emphasise the consequences of the implementation of the dark energy
perturbations on the result for a time varying equation of state. The impact of
future weak lensing surveys on the measurement of dark energy evolution is then

order of magnitude in the inner hot region of the envelope. Two other sources
show similar jumps, although at a lower confidence level. The observations for
the other three sources are well reproduced with a constant abundance, but the
presence of a jump cannot be ruled out. The observed methanol abundances in the
warm gas around low mass protostars are orders of magnitude higher than gas

suggest that the high methanol abundance reflects recent evaporation of ices

small while the average Lorentz factor Gamma is large. A few XRFs may be GRBs
at large redshifts but we exclude this possibility for the bulk of the

derived interactions in the spin-orbital model are strongly frustrated, with
the strongest orbital interactions selecting different orbitals for pairs of Ni

important role by breaking the U(1) symmetry generated by the much stronger

result the effective magnetic exchange is non-uniform and includes both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin interactions. Since ferromagnetic

absence of magnetic order and the low-temperature behaviour of the magnetic

poly(trimethylammonium ethylacrylate methylsulfate)-b-poly(acrylamide) with
sodium dodecyl sulfate. The two systems are similar in terms of structure and
molecular weight but have different electrostatic charges. The neutron
scattering data have been interpreted in terms of a model that assumes the
formation of mixed polymer-surfactant aggregates, also called colloidal
complexes. These complexes exhibit a core-shell microstructure, where the core
is a dense coacervate microphase of micelles surrounded by neutral blocks.
Here, we are taking advantage of the fact that the complexation results in
finite-size aggregates to shed some light on the complexation mechanisms. In
order to analyze quantitatively the neutron data, we develop two different
approaches to derive the number of surfactant micelles per polymer in the mixed
aggregates and the distributions of aggregation numbers. With these results, we
show that the formation of the colloidal complex is in agreement with the
overcharging predictions. In both systems, the amount of polyelectrolytes
needed to build the core-shell colloids always exceeds the number that would be
necessary to compensate the charge of the micelles. For the two
polymer-surfactant systems investigated, the overcharging ratios are 0.66 and
0.38.

relations are of bounded degree or a functional structure involving bijective
functions only. In this paper, we revisit the complexity of the evaluation
problem of not necessarily Boolean first-order queries over structures of
bounded degree. Query evaluation is considered here as a dynamical process. We
prove that any query on bounded degree structures is $\constantdelaylin$, i.e.,
can be computed by an algorithm that has two separate parts: it has a
precomputation step of linear time in the size of the structure and then, it
outputs all tuples one by one with a constant (i.e. depending on the size of
the formula only) delay between each. Seen as a global process, this implies
that queries on bounded structures can be evaluated in total time
$O(f(|\phi|).(|\calS|+|\phi(\calS)|))$ and space $O(f(|\phi|).|\calS|)$ where
$\calS$ is the structure, $\phi$ is the formula, $\phi(\calS)$ is the result of
the query and $f$ is some function.
  Among other things, our results generalize a result of \cite{Seese-96} on the
data complexity of the model-checking problem for bounded degree structures.
Besides, the originality of our approach compared to that \cite{Seese-96} and
comparable results is that it does not rely on the Hanf's model-theoretic
technic (see \cite{Hanf-65}) and is completely effective.

that the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation for relativistic
particles of $\lambda=\alpha R_{s}$ is always well below the Hawking
temperature of a black hole, in support of the proposed internal configuration.

the previous attempts are pointed out. It is shown that models with negative
powers of the scalar curvature, like the ones used to explain the present
accelerated expansion, as well as their generalization which include positive
powers, can give the correct Newtonian limit, as long as the coefficients of
these powers are reasonably small. Some consequences of the performed analysis
seem to raise doubts for the way the Newtonian limit was derived in the purely

variables of inhomogeneous cosmological models can be solved by providing a
`cosmic equation of state'. Recent efforts to explain Dark Energy focus on
`backreaction effects' of inhomogeneities on the effective evolution of
cosmological parameters in our Hubble volume, avoiding a cosmological constant
in the equation of state. In this Letter it is argued that, if kinematical
backreaction effects are indeed of the order of the averaged density (or larger
as needed for an accelerating domain of the Universe), then the state of our
regional Hubble volume would have to be in the vicinity of a
far-from-equilibrium state that balances kinematical backreaction and average
density. This property, if interpreted globally, is shared by a stationary
cosmos with effective equation of state $p_{\rm eff} = -1/3 \rho_{\rm eff}$. It
is concluded that a confirmed explanation of Dark Energy by kinematical
backreaction may imply a paradigmatic change of cosmology.

the model with $\omega = - 3/2$ \cite{fabris} we discuss the status of this
special case of Brans-Dicke cosmology in both isotropic and anisotropic
framework. It emerges that the limit $\omega = -3/2$ is consistent only with
the vacuum field equations and it makes such a Brans-Dicke theory conformally
invariant. Then it is an example of the conformal relativity theory which
allows the invariance with respect to conformal transformations of the metric.
Besides, Brans-Dicke theory with $\omega = -3/2$ gives a border between a
standard scalar field model and a ghost/phantom model.
  In this paper we show that in $\omega = -3/2$ Brans-Dicke theory, i.e., in
the conformal relativity there are no isotropic Friedmann solutions of non-zero
spatial curvature except for $k=-1$ case. Further we show that this $k=-1$
case, after the conformal transformation into the Einstein frame, is just the
Milne universe and, as such, it is equivalent to Minkowski spacetime. It
generally means that only flat models are fully consistent with the field
equations. On the other hand, it is shown explicitly that the anisotropic
non-zero spatial curvature models of Kantowski-Sachs type are admissible in
$\omega = -3/2$ Brans-Dicke theory. It then seems that an additional scale
factor which appears in anisotropic models gives an extra deegre of freedom and
makes it less restrictive than in an isotropic Friedmann case.

study causality in Lorentzian geometry. In the present paper, these tools are
further developed in several directions such as: (i) causal mappings --and,
thus, abstract chronological ones-- do not preserve two levels of the standard
hierarchy of causality conditions (however, they preserve the remaining levels
as shown in the above reference), (ii) even though global hyperbolicity is a
stable property (in the set of all time-oriented Lorentzian metrics on a fixed
manifold), the causal structure of a globally hyperbolic spacetime can be
unstable against perturbations; in fact, we show that the causal structures of
Minkowski and Einstein static spacetimes remain stable, whereas that of de
Sitter becomes unstable, (iii) general criteria allow us to discriminate
different causal structures in some general spacetimes (e.g. globally
hyperbolic, stationary standard); in particular, there are infinitely many
different globally hyperbolic causal structures (and thus, different conformal
ones) on $\R^2$, (iv) plane waves with the same number of positive eigenvalues
in the frequency matrix share the same causal structure and, thus, they have
equal causal extensions and causal boundaries.

of a metrical distance between general metric spaces and an appropriate scaling
limit (called by us a geometric renormalisation group) performed in this metric

atomic mass measurements within a relative uncertainty of $4.3 \times 10^{-7}$.
The gamma-ray measurement uncertainties are the dominant contributors to the

however, is not tenable anymore once the poverty index is found to follow a

in poverty, due to the presence of an inflexion point in the poverty function,
there is a critical value of the variance below which poverty decreases with

Verzicco that plates of finite conductivity diminish the heat transport in the

estimated by fitting simultaneously Aluminum- and Copper-plate data sets to an
effective powerlaw for N_infinity multiplied by a correction factor f(X) = 1 -
exp[-(aX)^b] that depends on the ratio X of the thermal resistance of the fluid
to that of the plates as suggested by Verzicco. Within their uncertainties the

previously introduced off-lattice agent-based model to the steady-state flow
equilibrium of skin. The dynamics of cells is determined by conservative and
drag forces,supplemented with delta-correlated random forces. Cellular
adjacency is detected by a weighted Delaunay triangulation. The cell cycle time
of keratinocytes is controlled by a diffusible substance provided by the
dermis. Its concentration is calculated from a diffusion equation with
time-dependent boundary conditions and varying diffusion coefficients. The
dynamics of a nutrient is also taken into account by a reaction-diffusion
equation. It turns out that the analysed control mechanism suffices to explain
several characteristics of epidermal homoeostasis formation. In addition, we
examine the question of how {\em in silico} melanoma with decreased basal
adhesion manage to persist within the steady-state flow-equilibrium of the
skin.Interestingly, even for melanocyte cell cycle times being substantially
shorter than for keratinocytes, tiny stochastic effects can lead to completely
different outcomes. The results demonstrate that the understanding of initial

off-lattice agent-based models in computer simulations.

that uses the algorithm for finding maximum of a discrete sequence. To prove
lower bounds we use results for finding logical OR of sequence of bits. We show
that quantum computation yields a quadratic speed-up over deterministic and
randomized algorithms.

atomic interferometers, where the quantity of interest is the difference of
phase shifts obtained by two independent atomic ensembles. An example is given
by an atomic Sagnac interferometer, where for two ensembles propagating in
opposite directions in the interferometer this phase difference encodes the
angular velocity of the experimental setup. We discuss methods of squeezing
separately or jointly observables of the two atomic ensembles, and compare in
detail advantages and drawbacks of such schemes. In particular we show that the
method of joint squeezing may improve the variance by up to a factor of 2. We
take into account fluctuations of the number of atoms in both the preparation
and the measurement stage, and obtain bounds on the difference of the numbers
of atoms in the two ensembles, as well as on the detection efficiency, which
have to be fulfilled in order to surpass the standard quantum limit. Under
realistic conditions, the performance of both schemes can be improved
significantly by reading out the phase difference via a quantum non-demolition
(QND) measurement. Finally, we discuss a scheme using macroscopically entangled
ensembles.

studied through simulations of single-atom trajectories, with full dynamical

favorably to open-loop ""switching"" analogs, demonstrating the importance of
applying actual position information in real time. The high optical information
rate in current experiments enables real-time tracking that approaches the

partitions of the Hilbert space in the form ${\bf C}^{2^N}\simeq{\bf

a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of Grassmannians Gr(L,l) of l-planes
in ${\bf C}^L$ that can be realized as the zero locus of quadratic polinomials
in the complex projective space of suitable dimension via the Plucker
embedding. The invariants are neatly expressed in terms of the Plucker

copies of it are available at the same time. It is well known that, if one uses
a separable state as the input for the unitaries, the optimal mean square error
will decrease as 1/n. However it is shown here that, if a proper entangled
state is used, the optimal mean square error will decrease at a 1/n^2 rate. It
is also shown that spherical 2-designs (e.g. complete sets of mutually unbiased
bases and symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures)
can be used to design optimal input states. Although 2-designs are believed to
exist for every dimension, this has not yet been proven. Therefore, we give an
alternative input state based on approximate 2-designs which can be made
arbitrarily close to optimal. It is shown that measurement strategies which are
based on local operations and classical communication between the ancilla and
the rest of the system can be optimal.
