lens. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of characterizing lenses by
using this method in future space-based lensing surveys. To judge the
feasibility of the method, we estimate the portions of events whose blended
flux F_b can be firmly noticed and most of it can be attributed to the lens by
carrying out detailed simulations of Galactic bulge lensing events considering
various blending sources, including the lens, background stars, and binary
companions to the lens and source. From this, it is estimated that among the
events to be detected from a survey using a 1 m space telescope, ~27% will have
blending fractions of F_b/F\geq 10% and the blended flux of half of these
events will be contaminated more than (F_b-F_L)/F_b=20% by the flux from
blending sources other than the lens, implying the contamination of the blended
flux will be substantial. Although the contamination by the background stars
can be reduced by using an instrument with a higher resolution, it is estimated
that the blended flux of more than 1/3 of events will still be contaminated
(mostly by binary companions) even using a telescope equivalent to the {\it
Hubble Space Telescope}, assuming 50% binary frequency. We, therefore, conclude
that caution and consideration of the blending contaminants are required in
applying the lens-light analysis method.

bulge field utilize two different methods of minimizing blending effect for the
accurate determination of the optical depth \tau. One is measuring \tau based
on clump giant (CG) source stars and the other is using `Difference Image
Analysis (DIA)' photometry to measure the unblended source flux variation.
Despite the expectation that the two estimates should be the same assuming that
blending is properly considered, the estimates based on CG stars systematically
fall below the DIA results based on all events with source stars down to the
detection limit. Prompted by the gap, we investigate the previously
unconsidered effect of companion-associated events on $\tau$ determination.
Although the image of a companion is blended with that of its primary star and
thus not resolved, the event associated with the companion can be detected if
the companion flux is highly magnified. Therefore, companions work effectively
as source stars to microlensing and thus neglect of them in the source star
count could result in wrong \tau estimation. By carrying out simulations based
on the assumption that companions follow the same luminosity function of
primary stars, we estimate that the contribution of the companion-associated
events to the total event rate is ~5f_{bi}% for current surveys and can reach
up to ~6f_{bi}% for future surveys monitoring fainter stars, where f_{bi} is
the binary frequency. Therefore, we conclude that the companion-associated
events comprise a non-negligible fraction of all events. However, their
contribution to the optical depth is not large enough to explain the systematic
difference between the optical depth estimates based on the two different
methods.

genus statistic on the Gaussian smoothing scale R_G from 3.5 to 11 h^-1Mpc and
on the luminosity of galaxies over the range -22.50<M_r<-18.5. The void
multiplicity A_V is less than unity at all smoothing scales. Because A_V cannot
become less than 1 through gravitational evolution, this result provides strong
evidence for biased galaxy formation in low density environments. We also find
clear evidence of luminosity bias of topology within the volume-limited
sub-samples. The shift parameter Delta nu indicates that the genus of brighter
galaxies shows a negative shift toward a ``meatball'' (i.e. cluster-dominated)
topology, while faint galaxies show a positive shift toward a ``bubble'' (i.e.
void-dominated) topology. The transition from negative to positive shift occurs
approximately at the characteristic absolute magnitude M_{r*}=-20.4. Even in
this analysis of the largest galaxy sample to date, we detect the influence of
individual large-scale structures, as the shift parameter Delta nu and cluster
multiplicity A_C reflect (at ~3 sigma) the presence of the Sloan Great Wall and
a X-shaped structure which runs for several hundred Mpc across the survey
volume.

a number of H_2 lines in the v=1-0, 2-1, and 3-2 vibrational transitions, as

absorption. Although only 3 of the galaxies are classified as Seyfert 1s in the
literature, broad Br_gamma (FWHM 1000kms) is seen in 7 of the objects. The
v=1-0 emission appears thermalised at T~1000K. However, the v=2-1 and 3-2
emission show evidence of being radiatively excited by far-UV photons. The PDR
models that fit the data best are, as for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies
in Davies et al. (2003), those for which the H_2 emission arises in dense
clouds illuminated by intense FUV radiation. The NaI stellar absorption is
clearly seen in 6 of the nuclear spectra, indicating the presence of a
significant population of late type stars. It is possible that these stars are
a result of the same episode of star formation that gave rise to the stars
heating the PDRs. It seems unlikely that the AGN is the dominant source of
excitation for the near infrared H_2 emission: in two nuclei H_2 was not
detected at all, and in general we find no evidence of suppression of the
2-1S(3) line, which may occur in X-ray irradiated gas. Our data do not reveal
any significant difference between the nuclear and circumnuclear line ratios,
suggesting that the physical conditions of the dominant excitation mechanism
are similar both near the AGN and in the larger scale environment around it,
and that star formation is an important process even in the central 100pc
acround AGN.

group of comets and follow trajectories that are tightly clumped in space.
Statistical analysis of 9 years of SOHO observations suggests that the true
apparition rate of these comets is as high as one every other day. Practically
all these comets break up before perihelion passage. Their material is
dissociated and ionized, and subsequently transported away from the Sun as
pickup ions in the solar wind. Their mean mass flux is about $3.1 10^4 g/s.
Since the breakup occurs between 40 and 4 solar radii and the ionization is
almost immediate, the expected location of these ions in the phase space is
close to the location of the inner source of pickup ions. Assuming radial
propagation, the cometary pickups should be observable at Earth between August
and January, with peak probability at the end of September. At Ulysses, they
should be observable approximately between -25 and 40 degrees ecliptic latitude
during the fast latitude scans, the first of which occurred in 1995 and the
second in 2001. The population of cometary pickup ions should be augmented by
about 40% by solar wind protons as a result of charge exchange with the
cometary neutral hydrogen and oxygen atoms and subsequent reionization of the
newly-created Energetic Neutral Atoms, streaming with respect to the solar
wind. In total, the average flux of the pickup ions related to the sungrazing
comets at 1 AU should be about 1.6 10^5 g/s/sr within the detection area (and
null outside it). This value is comparable to the flux of the inner
source-pickup ions.

with unprecedented detail a complex central network of filamentary structure

several spiral arms, some almost completing a revolution about the center, is
most prominent within the radius of about 300 pc. Some filaments can be traced
further out, where they seem to connect with the nuclear star-forming ring at
0.7 kpc radius. Straight principal shocks running along the primary large-scale
bar of NGC 1097, seen in the optical images as prominent dust lanes, curve into
this ring, but radio polarization vectors cross the nuclear ring under a rather
large angle. Here we attempt to explain this morphology in terms of
three-dimensional gas flow in a barred galaxy. In our scenario, parts of the
principal shock, which propagate in the off-plane gas, can cross the nuclear
star-forming ring, and excite waves inward from it. If the dispersion relation
of the excited waves allows for their propagation, they will naturally take the
shape of the observed central spiral. The nuclear region of NGC 1097 remains
unresolved at sub-arcsec scales in the near-IR, with an upper size limit of <10
pc FWHM. Thus, any putative central dusty torus or gaseosus disk envisaged by
the AGN unified schemes has to be smaller than 10 pc in diameter at near-IR
wavelengths. The extinction in the region between the nuclear star-forming ring

feature of both Galactic stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of Galactic sources have
shown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakens
dramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifesting
structural changes in the accretion flow. It is reasonable to assume that SMBHs
follow the same trend. For low luminosity SMBHs in nearby elliptical galaxies
and clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play the
central role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). If the outflow is
quenched in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galactic
sources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of
rapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central
engines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH
rapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high
radiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage
terminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its
feedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,
is able to suppress gas cooling. After that the system switches to a stable
state corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rate
and radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is high
and energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot.

always the plasticity criteria, even when the slope is smaller than the
friction angle. It results from this that the larger the slope angle the
smaller the mean stress and the smaller the maximum principal stress. So when
the pile rotates to generate the next instability the granular material is
submitted to a decrease of the mean stress, resulting in an increase of its
yielding angle, which becomes larger than the friction angle. The slope starts
then flowing at an angle larger than the friction angle.

positioning capabilities based on time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements. Although
the theoretical lower bound for TOA estimation can be achieved by the maximum

sampling and the presence of large number of multipath components. On the other
hand, the conventional correlation-based algorithm, which serially searches
possible signal delays, takes a very long time to estimate the TOA of a
received UWB signal. Moreover, the first signal path does not always have the
strongest correlation output. Therefore, first path detection algorithms need
to be considered. In this paper, a data-aided two-step TOA estimation algorithm
is proposed. In order to speed up the estimation process, the first step
estimates the rough TOA of the received signal based on received signal energy.
Then, in the second step, the arrival time of the first signal path is
estimated by considering a hypothesis testing approach. The proposed scheme
uses low-rate correlation outputs, and is able to perform accurate TOA
estimation in reasonable time intervals. The simulation results are presented
to analyze the performance of the estimator.

equations numerically, we clarify the role of Brans-Dicke field during
evolution of the universe. When the Hubble horizon is taken as the IR cutoff,
the equation of state ($w_{\Lmd}$) for the holographic energy density is
determined to be 5/3 when the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omg$ goes infinity. This
means that the Brans-Dicke field plays a crucial role in determining the
equation of state. For the particle horizon IR cutoff, the Brans-Dicke scalar
mediates a transition from $w_{\Lmd} = -1/3$ (past) to $w_{\Lmd} = 1/3$
(future). If a dust matter is present, it determines future equation of state.
In the case of future event horizon cutoff, the role of the Brans-Dicke scalar

density plays an important role as a dark energy candidate with $w_{\Lmd} =-1$.

ground and space-based laser interferometric detectors. The time-dependent
signature of these sources in the detectors is a well-characterized function of
a relatively small number of parameters; thus, the favored analysis technique
makes use of matched filtering and maximum likelihood methods. Current analysis
methodology samples the matched filter output at parameter values chosen so
that the correlation between successive samples is 97% for which the filtered
output is closely correlated. Here we describe a straightforward and practical
way of using interpolation to take advantage of the correlation between the
matched filter output associated with nearby points in the parameter space to
significantly reduce the number of matched filter evaluations without
sacrificing the efficiency with which real signals are recognized. Because the
computational cost of the analysis is driven almost exclusively by the matched
filter evaluations, this translates directly into an increase in computational
efficiency, which in turn, translates into an increase in the size of the
parameter space that can be analyzed and, thus, the science that can be
accomplished with the data. As a demonstration we compare the present ""dense
sampling"" analysis methodology with our proposed ""interpolation"" methodology,
restricted to one dimension of the multi-dimensional analysis problem. We find
that the interpolated search reduces by 25% the number of filter evaluations
required by the dense search with 97% correlation to achieve the same
efficiency of detection for an expected false alarm probability. Generalized to
higher dimensional space of a generic binary including spins suggests an order
of magnitude increase in computational efficiency.

require only arbitrarily small amounts of negative energy to hold them open
against self-collapse. If the exotic matter is assumed to be provided by
quantum fields, then quantum inequalities can be used to place constraints on
the negative energy densities required. In this paper, we introduce an
alternative method for obtaining constraints on wormhole geometries, using a
recently derived quantum inequality bound on the null-contracted stress-energy
averaged over a timelike worldline. The bound allows us to perform a simplified
analysis of general wormhole models, not just those with small quantities of
exotic matter. We then use it to study, in particular, the models of Visser,
Kar, and Dadhich (VKD) and the models of Kuhfittig. The VKD models are
constrained to be either submicroscopic or to have a large discrepancy between
throat size and curvature radius. A recent model of Kuhfittig is shown to be
non-traversable. This is due to the fact that the throat of his wormhole flares
outward so slowly that light rays and particles, starting from outside the
throat, require an infinite lapse of affine parameter to reach the throat.

studying the effect of the coupling between the Higgs and the localizer fields,
we obtain these scenarios as results, rather than ansaetze. Moreover, we
discuss other profiles and show that they are phenomenologically viable.

that, if two observables anticommute with each other at large distance, then
the nonvanishing spectral gap implies exponential decay of the corresponding
correlation. When two observables commute with each other at large distance,
the connected correlation function decays exponentially under the gap
assumption. If the observables behave as a vector under the U(1) rotation of a
global symmetry of the system, we use previous results on the large distance
decay of the correlation function to show the stronger statement that the
correlation function itself, rather than just the connected correlation
function, decays exponentially under the gap assumption on a lattice with a
certain self-similarity in (fractal) dimensions D<2. In particular, if the

and economical problems. The first part studies stock market data (chapter 1 to
5). The second part is devoted to personal income in the USA (chapter 6).
  We first study the probability distribution of stock returns at mesoscopic
time lags (return horizons) ranging from about an hour to about a month. For
mesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the
probability) follows an exponential law. At longer times, the exponential law
continuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.
  After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the
subordination hypothesis. The integrated volatility V_t constructed from the
number of trades process can be used as a subordinator for a Brownian motion.
This subordination is able to describe approximatly 85% of the stock returns
for time lags that start at 1 hour but are shorter than one day. Finally, we
show that the CIR process describes well enough the empirical V_t process, such
that the corresponding Heston model is able to describe the log-returns x_t
process, with approximately the maximum quality that the subordination allows.
  Finally, we study the time evolution of the personal income distribution. We
find that the personal income distribution in the USA has a well-defined
two-income-class structure. The majority of population (97-99%) belongs to the
lower income class characterized by the exponential Boltzmann-Gibb(``thermal'')
distribution, whereas the higher income class (1-3% of population) has a Pareto
power-law (``superthermal'') distribution. We show that the ``thermal'' part is
stationary in time.
