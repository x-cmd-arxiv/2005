masses are expected to end their lives as pair-production supernovae (PPSNe),
in which an electron-positron pair-production instability triggers explosive
nuclear burning. Interest in such stars has been rekindled by recent
theoretical studies that suggest primordial molecular clouds preferentially
form stars with these masses. Since metal enrichment is a local process, the
resulting PPSNe could occur over a broad range of redshifts, in pockets of
metal-free gas. Using the implicit hydrodynamics code KEPLER, we have
calculated a set of PPSN light curves that addresses the theoretical
uncertainties and allows us to assess observational strategies for finding
these objects at intermediate redshifts. The peak luminosities of typical PPSNe
are only slightly greater than those of Type Ia, but they remain bright much
longer (~ 1 year) and have hydrogen lines. Ongoing supernova searches may soon
be able to limit the contribution of these very massive stars to < 1% of the
total star formation rate density out to z=2 which already provides useful
constraints for theoretical models. The planned Joint Dark Energy Mission
satellite will be able to extend these limits out to z=6.

frequency-specific first-year WMAP sky maps, estimating the low-l multipole

processed (and foreground-contaminated) full-sky maps, the present approach
allows for greater control of residual foregrounds, and therefore potentially
also for cosmologically important conclusions. The low-l spherical harmonics
coefficients and corresponding multipole vectors are tabulated for easy
reference.
  Using this formalism, we re-assess a set of earlier claims of both
cosmological and non-cosmological low-l correlations based on multipole
vectors. First, we show that the apparent l=3 and 8 correlation claimed by Copi
et al. (2004) is present only in the heavily processed map produced by Tegmark
et al. (2003), and must therefore be considered an artifact of that map.
Second, the well-known quadrupole-octopole correlation is confirmed at the 99%
significance level, and shown to be robust with respect to frequency and sky
cut. Previous claims are thus supported by our analysis. Finally, the low-l
alignment with respect to the ecliptic claimed by Schwarz et al. (2004) is
nominally confirmed in this analysis, but also shown to be very dependent on
severe a-posteriori choices. Indeed, we show that given the peculiar
quadrupole-octopole arrangement, finding such a strong alignment with the
ecliptic is not unusual.

has not yet been found. It is considered a peculiar Wolf-Rayet star, and its
assigned classification varied along the years. High-resolution spectroscopic
observations show that the spectrum, in emission and in absorption, is quite
rich. The emission lines have great diversity of widths and profiles. The
Hydrogen and Helium lines are systematically broader than the CNO lines.
Assuming that HD 45166 is a double-line spectroscopic binary, it presents an
orbital period of P = 1.596 days, with an eccentricity of e = 0.18. In
addition, a search for periodicity using standard techniques reveals that the
emission lines present at least two other periods, of 5 hours and of 15 hours.
The secondary star has a spectral type of B7 V and, therefore, should have a
mass of about 4.8 solar masses. Given the radial velocity amplitudes, we
determined the mass of the hot (primary) star as being 4.2 solar masses and the
inclination angle of the system, i = 0.77 degr. As the eccentricity of the
orbit is non zero, the Roche lobes increase and decrease as a function of the
orbital phase. At periastron, the secondary star fills its Roche lobe. The
distance to the star has been re-determined as d = 1.3 kpc and a color excess
of E(B-V)=0.155 has been derived. This implies an absolute B magnitude of -0.6
for the primary star and -0.7 for the B7 star. We suggest that the discrete
absorption components (DACs) observed in the ultraviolet with a periodicity
similar to the orbital period may be induced by periastron events.

as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We use numerical MHD simulations which
include anisotropic electron heat conduction to follow the growth and
saturation of the MTI in two-dimensional, plane parallel atmospheres that are
unstable according to the Balbus criterion. The linear growth rates measured in
the simulations agree with the weak field dispersion relation. We investigate
the effect of strong fields and isotropic conduction on the linear properties

saturates and convection decays away, when the atmosphere becomes isothermal.
Sustained convective turbulence can be driven if there is a fixed temperature

extremely large scales, r<1000 Mpc. We compare this with mock predictions
constructed from the LCDM Hubble Volume mock catalogue. We find that over the
range 1<l<100 the 2MASS C_l is steeper than that for the Hubble Volume model.
However, in the linear regime (l<30) there is good agreement between the two.
We investigate in detail the effects of possible sources of systematic error.
Converting linear power spectrum predictions for the form of the
three-dimensional matter power spectrum, P(k), and assuming a flat CDM
cosmology, a primordial n_s=1 spectrum and negligible neutrino mass, we perform
fits to the galaxy angular power spectrum at large linear scales (l<30,
corresponding to r>50 Mpc). We obtain constraints on the galaxy power spectrum
shape of Gamma=0.14+/-0.02, in good agreement with previous estimates inferred
at smaller scales. We also constrain the galaxy power spectrum normalisation to
(sigma_8 b_K)^2=1.36+/-0.10; in combination with previous constraints on
sigma_8 we infer a K-band bias of b_K=1.39+/-0.12. We are also able to provide
weak constraints on Omega_m h and Omega_b/Omega_m. These results are based on
the usual assumption that the errors derived from the Hubble Volume mocks are
applicable to all other models. If we instead assume that the error is
proportional to the C_l amplitude then the constraints weaken; for example it
becomes more difficult to reject cosmologies with lower Gamma.

the bars are known to weaken dramatically and develop a pronounced boxy/peanut

stellar disks embedded in live axisymmetric dark matter halos, we have
investigated the long-term changes in the bar morphology, specifically the
evolution of the bar size, its vertical structure and exchange of angular
momentum. We find that following the initial buckling, the bar resumes its
growth from deep inside the corotation radius and follows the Ultra-Harmonic
resonance thereafter. We also find that this secular bar growth triggers a
spectacular secondary vertical buckling instability which leads to the
appearance of characteristic boxy/peanut/X-shaped bulges. The secular bar
growth is crucial for the recurrent buckling to develop. Furthermore, the
secondary buckling is milder, persists over a substantial period of time, ~3
Gyr, and can have observational counterparts. Overall, the stellar bars show
recurrent behavior in their properties and evolve by increasing their linear
and vertical extents, both dynamically and secularly. We also demonstrate
explicitly that the prolonged growth of the bar is mediated by continuous
angular momentum transfer from the disk to the surrounding halo, and that this
angular momentum redistribution is resonant in nature -- a large number of
lower resonances trap disk and halo particles and this trapping is robust, in a
broad agreement with the earlier results in the literature.

and demonstrated good fits to our sample of 101 LSB, HSB and dwarf galaxies
including 58 galaxies that were fit photometrically with the single parameter
(M/L)_{stars}. The results there were qualitatively similar to those obtained
using Milgrom's phenomenological MOND model, although the determined galaxy
masses were quantitatively different and MOND does not show a return to
Keplerian behavior at extragalactic distances. The results here are compared to
those obtained using Milgrom's phenomenological MOND model which does not fit
the X-ray galaxy cluster masses unless an auxiliary dark matter component is
included.

reasonable to truncate the Taylor series if $|n'_* ln(k/k_*)| << |n_*-1|$, but
it is not if $|n'_* ln(k/k_*)| \gtrsim |n_*-1|$. We argue that there is no good
theoretical reason to prefer $|n'_*| << |n_*-1|$, and show that current
observations are consistent with $|n'_* ln(k/k_*)| ~ |n_*-1|$ even for
$|ln(k/k_*)| ~ 1$. Thus, there are regions of parameter space, which are both
theoretically and observationally relevant, for which the traditional truncated
Taylor series parameterization is inconsistent, and hence it can lead to
incorrect parameter estimations. Motivated by this, we propose a simple
extension of the traditional parameterization, which uses no extra parameters,
but that, unlike the traditional approach, covers well motivated inflationary
spectra with $|n'_*| ~ |n_*-1|$. Our parameterization therefore covers not only
standard-slow-roll inflation models but also a much wider class of inflation
models. We use this parameterization to perform a likelihood analysis for the
cosmological parameters.

describing this exchange. We investigate the constraints from various
cosmological observations on the flow of matter from the bulk into the brane.
Interestingly, we show that it is possible to have a $\Lambda = 0$ cosmology to
an observer in the brane which satisfies standard cosmological constraints
including the CMB temperature fluctuations, Type Ia supernovae at high
redshift, and the matter power spectrum. This model even accounts for the
observed suppression of the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles. In this
cosmology, the observed cosmic acceleration is attributable to the flow of
matter from the bulk to the brane. A peculiar aspect of this cosmology is that
the present dark-matter content of the universe may be significantly larger
than that of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Its influence, however, is offset by the
dark-radiation term. Possible additional observational tests of this new

electron doping is increased. Such a phase is necessarily accompanied by
singular forward scattering such that, in the stable phase, the density of

written contribution is to provide a Primer version, that is, a first entry
into Loop Quantum Gravity and to present at the same time a friendly guide to
the existing pedagogical literature on the subject. This account is geared
towards graduate students and non-experts interested in learning the basics of
the subject.

field theoretical description of Bremsstrahlung from the inertial and
accelerated observer's perspectives. More concretely, we focus on the seemingly
paradoxical situation that arises when noting that the radiating source is in
thermal equilibrium with the thermal state of the quantum field in the wedge in
which it is located, and thus its presence does not change there the state of
the field, while it clearly does not affect the state of the field on the
opposite wedge. How then is the state of the quantum field on the future wedge
changed, as it must in order to account for the changed energy momentum tensor
there? This and related issues are carefully discussed.

inner planets of the Solar System are about 10^-3 arcseconds per century.
Recent improvements in planetary orbit determination may yield the first
observational evidence of such a tiny effect. Indeed, corrections to the known
perihelion rates of -0.0036 +/- 0.0050, -0.0002 +/- 0.0004 and 0.0001 +/-
0.0005 arcseconds per century were recently estimated by E.V. Pitjeva for
Mercury, the Earth and Mars, respectively, on the basis of the EPM2004
ephemerides and a set of more than 317,000 observations of various kinds. The
predicted relativistic Lense-Thirring precessions for these planets are
-0.0020, -0.0001 and -3 10^-5 arcseconds per century, respectively and are
compatible with the determined perihelia corrections. The relativistic
predictions fit better than the zero-effect hypothesis, especially if a
suitable linear combination of the perihelia of Mercury and the Earth, which a
priori cancels out any possible bias due to the solar quadrupole mass moment,
is considered. However, the experimental errors are still large. Also the
latest data for Mercury processed independently by Fienga et al. with the INPOP
ephemerides yield preliminary insights about the existence of the solar
Lense-Thirring effect. The data from the forthcoming planetary mission
BepiColombo will improve our knowledge of the orbital motion of this planet
and, consequently, the precision of the measurement of the Lense-Thirring
effect. As a by-product of the present analysis, it is also possible to
constrain the strength of a Yukawa-like fifth force to a 10^-12-10^-13 level at
scales of about one Astronomical Unit (10^11 m).

integrability conditions, which contain the field equations, on five types of
spinors. This extends the work of [hep-th/0503046] to IIB supergravity. We give
the expressions of the Killing spinor equations on all five types of spinors.
In this way, the Killing spinor equations become a linear system for the
fluxes, geometry and spacetime derivatives of the functions that determine the
Killing spinors. This system can be solved to express the fluxes in terms of
the geometry and determine the conditions on the geometry of any supersymmetric
background. Similarly, the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor
equations are turned into a linear system. This can be used to determine the

supersymmetric background. We show that these linear systems simplify for
generic backgrounds with maximal and half-maximal number of $H$-invariant
Killing spinors, $H\subset Spin(9,1)$. In the maximal case, the Killing spinor
equations factorize, whereas in the half-maximal case they do not. As an
example, we solve the Killing spinor equations of backgrounds with two
$SU(4)\ltimes \bR^8$-invariant Killing spinors. We also solve the linear
systems associated with the integrability conditions of maximally
supersymmetric $Spin(7)\ltimes\bR^8$- and $SU(4)\ltimes\bR^8$-backgrounds and
determine the field equations that are not implied by the Killing spinor

of the volume because energy density is very high. This includes the gas for
the well known Brandenberger-Vafa cosmological scenario. We describe the gas in

description, we find a result that clearly confronts the Brandenberger-Vafa
calculation to get the specific heat of the system. The important point is that
we use the same approach to the problem but a different regularization. By the

used to calculate QED strong Coulomb field radiative corrections to energies
and electric dipole (E1) transition amplitudes in many-electron atoms with an
accuracy of a few percent. The expectation value of the radiative potential
gives radiative corrections to the energies. Radiative corrections to E1
amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the radiative potential and its energy
derivative (the low-energy theorem): the relative magnitude of the radiative
potential contribution is ~alpha^3 Z^2 ln(1/(alpha^2 Z^2)), while the sum of
other QED contributions is ~alpha^3 (Z_i+1)^2, where Z_i is the ion charge;
that is, for neutral atoms (Z_i=0) the radiative potential contribution exceeds
other contributions ~Z^2 times. The advantage of the radiative potential method
is that it is very simple and can be easily incorporated into many-body theory
approaches: relativistic Hartree-Fock, configuration interaction, many-body
perturbation theory, etc. As an application we have calculated the radiative
corrections to the energy levels and E1 amplitudes as well as their
contributions (-0.33% and 0.42%, respectively) to the parity non-conserving
(PNC) 6s-7s amplitude in neutral cesium (Z=55). Combining these results with
the QED correction to the weak matrix elements (-0.41%) we obtain the total QED
correction to the PNC 6s-7s amplitude, (-0.32 +/- 0.03)%. The cesium weak

"q-bio/0507013","Ana Nunes","A. Nunes, M. M. Telo da Gama and M. G. M. Gomes","Does host contact structure reduce pathogen diversity?","28 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  We investigate the dynamics of a simple epidemiological model for the
invasion by a pathogen strain of a population where another strain circulates.
We assume that reinfection by the same strain is possible but occurs at a
reduced rate due to acquired immunity. The rate of reinfection by a distinct
strain is also reduced due to cross-immunity. Individual based simulations of
this model on a `small-world' network show that the host contact network
structure significantly affects the outcome of such an invasion, and as a
consequence will affect the patterns of pathogen evolution. In particular, host
populations interacting through a 'small-world' network of contacts support
lower prevalence of infection than well-mixed populations, and the region in
parameter space for which an invading strain can become endemic and coexist
with the circulating strain is smaller, reducing the potential to accommodate
pathogen diversity. We discuss the underlying mechanisms for the reported
effects, and we propose an effective mean-field model to account for the
contact structure of the host population in 'small-world' networks.

laser pulse produces a strongly enhanced postpulse orientation. Robust
transients that display both efficient and long-lived orientation are obtained.
The mechanism is analyzed in terms of optimal oriented target states in finite
Hilbert subspaces and shows that hybrid pulses can prove useful for other
control issues.
