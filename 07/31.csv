"astro-ph/0508006","Sun Hong Rhie","Sun Hong Rhie","How Far Away are Gravitational Lens Caustics? Wrong Question","21 pages+2 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  It has been a persistent question at least for a decade where the
gravitational lens caustics are in the radial direction: whether in front of
the lensing mass, behind the lensing mass, or on the plane normal to the line
of sight that passes through the lensing mass, the radiation source, or the
observer. It is a wrong question. And, the truth angers certain referees who
somehow possess the ability to write lengthy rubbish referee reports and delay
certain papers indefinitely.
  General relativity is a metric theory, particularly of Riemannian geometry,
which is characterized by the existence of an inner product -- or, the
invariance of the proper time. According to Einstein field equations, a compact
mass defines a spherical geometry around it and focuses photons from a distant
source to an observer with the source and observer as the two focal points.
When the mass is spherically symmetric, the two dimensional lens equation that
relates the angular positions of a source and its images defines a point
caustic at the angular position of the lensing mass.
  The third (radial) position of the point caustic is not defined. For an
arbitrary mass, the caustic extends into a web of piecewise smooth curves
punctuated by cusps and again its notion exists only within the context of the
lens equation. We point out a few errors in a couple of papers, published in
the Astrophysical Journal, which may be influential.

that these fluctuations can be considered static at time scales of fermionic

the flux-flux correlator due to thermal fluctuations of magnetic field is
proportional to the area enclosed by the loop, the correlator due to quantum
fluctuations is proportional to the perimeter of the loop. The possibility of
dephasing due to these quasistatic configurations and the corresponding rates
are discussed. We also study interaction induced effects and show that
perturbation theory contains infrared divergent terms originating from
unscreened magnetic interactions. These singular (Hartree) terms are related to
scattering of a fermion off of the static potential created by the other
fermions. We show that due to singular small-angle scattering, the
corresponding contributions to the density of states and conductivity are very
large and positive indicating that the fermion-gauge system remains metallic at

electrons in the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) regime via a utilization of
an electronic analog of the well-known Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The
beauty of this experiment lies in the simplicity of two path interference.
Electrons that travel the two paths via edge channels, feel only the edge
potential and the strong magnetic field; both typical in the IQHE regime. Yet,
the interference of these electrons via the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect, behaves
surprisingly in a most uncommon way.
  We found, at filling factors 1 and 2, high visibility interference
oscillations, which were strongly modulated by a lobe-type structure as we
increased the electron injection voltage. The visibility went through a few
maxima and zeros in between, with the phase of the AB oscillations staying
constant throughout each lobe and slipping abruptly by at each zero. The lobe
pattern and the 'stick-slip' behavior of the phase were insensitive to details
of the interferometer structure; but highly sensitive to magnetic field. The
observed periodicity defines a 'new energy scale' with an unclear origin. The
phase rigidity, on the other hand, is surprising since Onsager relations are
not relevant here.

reviewed such as the idea that the Earth was at the center of the universe or
that the second law of thermodynamics was fundamental. Examples of excess

estimates for the derivative of a multivariate polynomial in points of some
domain, where the polynomial is assumed to have sup norm at most 1. One method,
due to Sarantopoulos, relies on inscribing ellipses into the convex domain K.
The other, pluripotential theoretic approach, mainly due to Baran, works for
even more general sets, and yields estimates through the use of the
pluricomplex Green function (the Zaharjuta -Siciak extremal function). Using
the inscribed ellipse method on non-symmetric convex domains, a key role was
played by the generalized Minkowski functional a(K,x). With the aid of this
functional, our current knowledge is precise within a constant (squareroot 2)
factor. Recently L. Milev and the author derived the exact yield of this method
in the case of the simplex, and a number of numerical improvements were
obtained compared to the general estimates known. Here we compare the yields of
this real, geometric method and the results of the complex, pluripotential
theoretical approaches on the case of the simplex. In conclusion we can observe
a few remarkable facts, comment on the existing conjectures, and formulate a

differential light-induced length changes. The photothermal and
photo-reorientation mechanisms, each with its own distinct response time, are
proposed to explain the observed time dependence. The measured degree of
bending is consistent with a model that we have proposed which includes
coupling between photoisomerization and heating. Most importantly, we have
discovered that at high light intensity, a cooperative release of stress
results in cis-to-trans isomerization that yields a large and abrupt length
change.

also been suggested as the dominant mechanism. Here we show that observed
topological features of predatory food webs can be reproduced to unprecedented
accuracy by a mechanism taking into account only phylogeny, size constraints,
and the heredity of the trophically relevant traits of prey and predators. The
analysis reveals a tendency to avoid resource competition rather than apparent
competition. In food webs with many parasites this pattern is reversed.
