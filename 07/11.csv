simulations of relativistic jet-plasma interactions and discuss the underlying
mechanisms. The dynamics of a charge-neutral, narrow, electron-positron jet
propagating through an unmagnetized electron-ion plasma was investigated using
a three-dimensional, electromagnetic, particle-in-cell computer code. The
interaction excited magnetic filamentation as well as electrostatic plasma
instabilities. In some cases, the longitudinal electric fields generated
inductively and electrostatically reached the cold plasma wave-breaking limit,
and the longitudinal momentum of about half the positrons increased by 50% with
a maximum gain exceeding a factor of 2 during the simulation period. Particle
acceleration via these mechanisms occurred when the criteria for Weibel
instability were satisfied.

pulsars, J0437-4715, J2124-3358, J1024-0719, and J0034-0534. The new data
provide strong evidence of thermal emission in the X-ray flux detected from the
first three objects. This thermal component is best interpreted as radiation
from pulsar polar caps covered with a nonmagnetic hydrogen atmosphere. A
nonthermal power-law component, dominating at energies E>3 keV, can also be
present in the detected X-ray emission. For PSR J0437-4715, the timing analysis
reveals that the shape and pulsed fraction of the pulsar light curves are
energy dependent. This, together with the results obtained from the
phase-resolved spectroscopy, supports the two-component (thermal plus
nonthermal) interpretation of the pulsar's X-ray radiation. Highly significant
pulsations have been found in the X-ray flux of PSRs J2124-3358 and J1024-0719.
For PSR J0034-0534, a possible X-ray counterpart of the radio pulsar has been
suggested. The inferred properties of the detected thermal emission are
compared with predictions of radio pulsar models.

Recently, a long-awaited breakthrough in this field was achieved: NGC 1068, a
nearby AGN, was the first extragalactic object to be observed with a mid-IR
interferometer, thereby obtaining the needed angular resolution to study the
alleged torus.
  In this proceeding, first the field of AGN research is briefly reviewed, with
an emphasis on models of dusty tori. Second, the general properties of the key
object NGC 1068 are discussed. Third, the MIDI mid-IR interferometric data set
is presented together with a first attempt to interpret this data in the
context of tori models. Fourth, preliminary MIDI interferometric spectra of the
nucleus of the nearby starbursting galaxy Circinus are presented. Finally, we
briefly discuss the prospects of ESA's Darwin mission for observing nearby and
distant AGN. This mission will allow detailed mapping of tori of low luminosity
AGN such as NGC 1068 up to redshifts of 1 - 2 and more luminous AGN up to
redshift of 10 and beyond (abridged).

avoids the need to explicitly compute the eigenmodes of the Laplacian operator

expressed in terms of the elements of the covering group of the space. We
obtain a decomposition of the correlation matrix that isolates the topological

correlation matrix for an arbitrary topology allows us to compute it in terms
of correlation matrices corresponding to simpler topologies, for which closed
quadrature formulae might be derived. We also use this decomposition to show
that CMB temperature maps of (not too large) multiply connected universes must
show ``patterns of alignment'', and propose a method to look for these
patterns, thus opening the door to the development of new methods for detecting
the topology of our Universe even when the injectivity radius of space is
slightly larger than the radius of the last scattering surface. We illustrate

models because of its dynamically evolved structure and rich stellar
populations that show clear signs of interaction between stellar, binary and
cluster evolution. Here we present the first truly direct N-body model for M67,
evolved from zero age to 4 Gyr taking full account of cluster dynamics as well
as stellar and binary evolution. Our preferred model starts with 12000 single
stars and 12000 binaries placed in a Galactic tidal field at 8.0 kpc from the
Galactic Centre. Our choices for the initial conditions and for the primordial
binary population are explained in detail. At 4 Gyr, the age of M67, the total
mass has reduced by 90% as a result of mass loss and stellar escapes. The mass
and half-mass radius of luminous stars in the cluster are a good match to
observations although the model is more centrally concentrated than
observations indicate. The stellar mass and luminosity functions are
significantly flattened by preferential escape of low-mass stars. We find that
M67 is dynamically old enough that information about the initial mass function
is lost, both from the current luminosity function and from the current mass
fraction in white dwarfs. The model contains 20 blue stragglers at 4 Gyr which
is slightly less than the 28 observed in M67. Nine are in binaries. The blue
stragglers were formed by a variety of means and we find formation paths for
the whole variety observed in M67. Both the primordial binary population and
the dynamical cluster environment play an essential role in shaping the
population. A substantial population of short-period primordial binaries (with
periods less than a few days) is needed to explain the observed number of blue
stragglers in M67.

of the ULIRG population. Most of \ISO FIR sources have their FIR-radio ratios
similar to star-forming galaxies ARP 220 and M82. At least seven of our FIR
sources show evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in
optical emission lines, radio continuum excess, or X-ray activity. Three out of
five (60%) of the ULIRG/HyLIRGs are AGN galaxies. Five of the seven AGN
galaxies are within the ROSAT X-ray survey field, and two are within the
XMM-Newton survey fields. X-ray emission has been detected in only one source,
1EX030, which is optically classified as a quasar. The non-detection in the
XMM-Newton 2-10 keV band suggests a very thick absorption obscuring the central
source of the two AGN galaxies. Several sources have an extreme FIR luminosity
relative to the optical R-band, L(90\mu\mathrm{m})/L(R) > 500, which is rare
even among the local ULIRG population. While source confusion or blending might
offer an explanation in some cases, they may represent a new population of
galaxies with an extreme activity of star formation in an undeveloped stellar
system -- i.e., formation of bulges or young ellipticals.

result from an X-ray induced wind which is evaporated from an O and Ne rich

the models investigated here, our best models reproduce both the solar radius
and the solar luminosity at solar age and the observed Balmer line profiles.
For the MLT treatment, the rates P do depend significantly on the properties of
the atmosphere whereas for the CGM's treatment the dependence of P on the
properties of the atmosphere is found smaller than the error bars attached to
the seismic measurements. The excitation rates P for modes associated with the
MLT models are significantly underestimated compared with the solar seismic
constraints. The CGM models yield values for P closer to the seismic data than
the MLT models. We conclude that the solar p-mode excitation rates provide
valuable constraints and according to the present investigation clearly favor
the CGM treatment with respect to the MLT, although neither of them yields
values of P as close to the observations as recently found for 3D numerical

with elliptical isophotes with constant flattening and position angle. The disk
luminosity profile is assumed exponential, while the bulge is assumed to have a
de Vaucouleurs or a Sersic profile. We find that the parameters returned by
Gim2D depend little on the waveband or bulge profile used; their formal
uncertainties are usually small. Nevertheless, for bright galaxies the measured
distribution of b/a, the apparent disk flattening, deviates strongly from the
expected uniform distribution, showing that the `disk' identified by the code
frequently corresponds to an intrinsically 3-dimensional structure rather than
to a true thin disk. We correct approximately for this systematic problem using
the observed statistics of the b/a distribution and estimate, as a function of
absolute magnitude, the mean fractions of galaxy light in disks and in `pure
bulge' systems (those with no detectable disk). For the brightest galaxies the
disk light fraction is about 10% and about 80% are `pure bulge' systems. For
faint galaxies most of the light is in disks and we do not detect a `pure

function $f(z)$ contained in the solution plays a similar role as the potential
$V(\phi)$ in quintessence and phantom dark energy models. To resolve the
coincidence problem, it is generally believed that there is a scaling stage in
the evolution of the universe. We analyze the condition for this stage and show
that a hyperbolic form of the function $f(z)$ can work well in this property.
We find that during the scaling stage (before $z\approx 2$), the dark energy
behaves like (but not identical to) a cold dark matter with an adiabatic sound
speed $c_{s}^{2}\approx 0$ and $p_{x}\approx 0$. After $z\approx 2$, the
pressure of dark energy becomes negative. The transition from deceleration to
acceleration happens at $z_{T}\approx 0.8$ which, as well as other predictions
of the $5D$ model, agree with current observations.

interaction with NGC 4435, and an ISM-ISM collision between the ISM of NGC 4438
and NGC 4435. We present new CO observations covering virtually all of NGC 4438

double line profiles at distances up to 40"" to the west and south-west and
redshifted lines with respect to galactic rotation in the south of the center.
The lack of gas to the North and East coupled with the large gaseous extent to
the West and the redshifted and double line profiles can only be reproduced
with a ram pressure wind. NGC 4438 is most probably on its first passage
through the cluster center and has been stripped of its HI only over the past
100 Myr. While an ISM-ISM collision between NGC 4435 and NGC 4438 may occur,
the effect is not significant compared to ram pressure and tidal forces, not
surprising for the passage of an S0 galaxy 5-10 kpc from the center of NGC
4438. We also detect narrow CO lines, in the absence of detected HI, in the
northern tidal arm some 15 kpc from the center of NGC 4438. This can be
understood from the simulations assuming a few percent of the gas is too dense
to experience the ram pressure wind. NGC 4438 has changed greatly over the past
100 Myr due to its plunge through the center of the Virgo cluster and the
interaction with the S0 NGC 4435.

episodes during the central helium burning is needed. This conclusion is valid
for thick helium envelopes like those predicted by our detailed evolutionary

occurrence of core overshooting would be more difficult to disentangle from the

enhancement of weak gravitational lensing on arc-minute scales lowers the value
of sigma_8 inferred from a given lensing amplitude as compared to Lambda-CDM.
In presence of Early Dark Energy, structures grow slower, such that for given
sigma_8 the number of galaxies and galaxy clusters is substantially increased

approach to the calculation of the dimer-dimer scattering length $a_B$, we
recover exactly the already known result $a_B=0.60 a_F$. We use the developed
approach to obtain new results in 2D for fermions as well as for bosons.
Namely, we calculate bound state energies for three $bbb$ and four $bbbb$
resonantly interacting bosons in 2D. For the case of resonant interaction
between fermions and bosons we calculate exactly bound state energies of the
following complexes: two bosons plus one fermion $bbf$, two bosons plus two
fermions $bf_{\uparrow}bf_{\downarrow}$, and three bosons plus one fermion
$bbbf$.

anisotropic distribution, the static asymptotic critical behaviour coincides
with that of random site Ising systems. Therefore the asymptotic critical

However, the disorder influences considerably the dynamical behaviour in the

model free energy combines mean-field electrostatic and phenomenological
non-electrostatic interactions, while the number of dissociated counterions is
treated as a variable degree of freedom that is determined self-consistently.
The model, therefore, joins two well-known theories: the Poisson-Boltzmann
theory for ionic solutions between charged lamellae, and
Langmuir-Frumkin-Davies adsorption isotherm modified to account for charged
adsorbing species. Minimizing the appropriate free energy for each
interlamellar spacing, we find the ionic density profiles and the resulting
osmotic pressure. While in the simple Poisson-Boltzmann theory the osmotic
pressure isotherms are always smooth, we observe a discontinuous liquid-liquid
phase transition when Poisson-Boltzmann theory is self-consistently augmented
by Langmuir-Frumkin-Davies adsorption. This phase transition depends on the
area per amphiphilic headgroup, as well as on non-electrostatic interactions of
the counterions with the lamellae, and interactions between counterion-bound
and counterion-dissociated surfactants. Coupling lateral phase transition in
the bilayer plane with electrostatic interactions in the bulk, our results

calculate reliably in the Standard Model of particle physics and probing
possible new particles which may exist beyond it. In the first part, we explore
whether baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition could successfully
account for the observed density of baryons in the Universe, using the
closed-time-path (CTP) formalism of quantum field theory to calculate the
buildup and relaxation of particle densities during the phase transition.
Adopting the MSSM for its new sources of CP violation, we look for regions of
parameter space which could give rise to sufficiently large baryon asymmetry
without violating constraints on these parameters from existing experiments,
especially searches for electric dipole moments of elementary particles. In the
second part, we explore how to get around our ignorance of the dynamics of
strongly interacting particles in the nonperturbative regime of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) by the use of effective field theories. Two applications
are explored: the production of hadronic jets in Z decay or e+e- annihilation
using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), and the radiative decays of
quarkonia to light hadrons using SCET and non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). These
tools facilitate the proof of factorization of decay rates into
perturbatively-calculable and nonperturbative parts. Universality of the latter

caustic singularities, the dynamics is equivalent to the irrotational flow of a
perfect fluid with equation of state p \propto \rho^2, where the fluid
particles can have negative mass. We argue that this theory is free from
catastrophic instabilities due to growing modes, even though the null energy
condition is violated. Numerical simulations show that solutions generally have
singularities in which negative energy regions shrink to zero size. We exhibit
partial UV completions of the theory in which these singularities are smoothly
resolved, so this does not signal any inconsistency in the effective theory. We
also consider the bounds on the symmetry breaking scale M in this theory. We
argue that the nonlinear dynamics cuts off the Jeans instability of the linear
theory, and allows M \lsim 100MeV.

Supersymmetry naturally provides a candidate for the dark matter constituents
via the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The most important process for
directly detecting dark matter is the LSP-nucleus elastic scattering by
measuring the energy of the recoiling nucleus. In the present work we explore a
novel process, which has definite experimental advantages, that is the
detection of the dark matter constituents by observing the low energy
ionization electrons. These electrons, which are produced during the
LSP-nucleus collision, may be observed separately or in coincidence with the
recoiling nuclei.
  We develop the formalism and apply it in calculating the ratio of the
ionization rate to the nuclear recoil rate in a variety of atoms including
Ne-20, Ar-40, Ge-76, Kr-78 and Xe-132 employing realistic Hartree-Fock electron
wave functions.
  The obtained ratios are essentially independent of all parameters of
supersymmetry except the neutralino mass, but they crucially depend on the
electron energy cut off. These ratios per electron tend to increase with the
atomic number and can be as high as 10 per cent. Based on our results it is
both interesting and realistic to detect the LSP by measuring the ionization
electrons following the-LSP nuclear collisions.

previous paper E243, Euler stated the pentagonal number theorem and assuming it
proved a recurrence relation for the sum of divisors function. In E244 Euler
proves the pentagonal number theorem, and then repeats the proof of the
recurrence. In Proposition 1, Euler proves that $\prod_{n=1}^\infty
(1-a_n)=1-\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n(1-a_1)...(1-a_{n-1})$. In Proposition 2 he
explicitly states the case $a_n=x^n$. Then in Proposition 3, Euler applies
Proposition 2 then collects terms: each time this leaves two terms from the
series $\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^n x^{n(3n-1)/2}$. This is explained in
detail in a paper I am working on about Euler's work on the pentagonal number
theorem.

of volatility, which assumes that the volatility is governed by the observed
past price changes on different time scales. With a power-law distribution of
time horizons, we obtain a model that captures most stylized facts of financial
time series: Student-like distribution of returns with a power-law tail,
long-memory of the volatility, slow convergence of the distribution of returns
towards the Gaussian distribution, multifractality and anomalous volatility
relaxation after shocks. At variance with recent multifractal models that are
strictly time reversal invariant, the model also reproduces the time assymmetry
of financial time series: past large scale volatility influence future small
scale volatility. In order to quantitatively reproduce all empirical
observations, the parameters must be chosen such that our model is close to an
instability, meaning that (a) the feedback effect is important and
substantially increases the volatility, and (b) that the model is intrinsically
difficult to calibrate because of the very long range nature of the
correlations. By imposing the consistency of the model predictions with a large
set of different empirical observations, a reasonable range of the parameters
value can be determined. The model can easily be generalized to account for
jumps, skewness and multiasset correlations.

are nearly constant. The constant value of the derivatives indicates linear
relationship between the variables. Neither the volume coefficient of thermal
expansion nor the bulk modulus are constant and show pressure and temperature
dependence. Besides the derivatives the only other quantity in the definition
of the volume coefficient of thermal expansion and the bulk modulus is the
volume. It is suggested that the pressure and temperature dependence of these
parameters is resulted from the improper identification of the volume. In solid
phase the actual volume is not an independent variable but rather comprises
from three more fundamental volume components, initial, thermal, and elastic
volumes. The pressure correlates to the elastic volume and the temperature to
the thermal volume. New definitions for the volume coefficient of thermal
expansion and the bulk modulus are proposed by identifying the fundamental
volume parts specifically. The complete separation of the thermal and elastic
volumes is consistent with theory since the vibrational and static energies are
completely independent of each other. Based on the independence of the thermal
and elastic deformations it is suggested that thermo elastic coupling should
not exist in solid phase in the elastic domain with the exception of constant
volume. It is also suggested that the thermo-elastic coupling is irreversible
and exist only in the temperature-pressure direction.

considered, within a model that accounts for long-range dipole-dipole
interactions, plus rotation of the molecules. We predict a substantial
suppression of dipole-driven inelastic collisions at high values of the applied
electric field, namely, field values of several times $B_e/\mu$. Here $B_e$ is
the rotational constant, and $\mu$ is the electric dipole moment of molecules.
  The sudden large drop in the inelastic cross section is attributed to the
onset of degeneracy between molecular rotational levels, which dramatically
alters the scattering Hamiltonian. As a result of the large ratio of elastic to
inelastic collision rates, we predict that evaporative cooling may be feasible
for $^{1}\Sigma$ state molecules in weak-field-seeking states, provided a large
bias electric field is present.

analysis of a broad variety of nonstationary signals. We show in the present
article that, provided the nonstationary fluctuations occur at a large enough
time scale, an alternative approach can be obtained by using the Fourier series
of the signal. More specifically, signal reconstructions considering Fourier
series with increasing number of higher spectral components are subtracted from
the signal, while the dispersion of such a difference is calculated. The slope
of the loglog representation of the dispersions in terms of the time scale
(reciprocal of the frequency) is calculated and used for the characterization
of the signal. The detrend action in this methodology is performed by the early
incorporation of the low frequency spectral components in the signal
representation. The application of the spectral DFA to the analysis of heart
rate variability data has yielded results which are similar to those obtained
by traditional DFA. Because of the direct relationship with the spectral
content of the analyzed signal, the spectral DFA may be used as a complementary
resource for characterization and analysis of some types of nonstationary
signals.

  Journ. Math. Phys",,"10.1063/1.2222080",,"quant-ph",,"  In a previous paper we have presented a general scheme for the implementation
of symmetric generalized measurements (POVMs) on a quantum computer. This
scheme is based on representation theory of groups and methods to decompose
matrices that intertwine two representations. We extend this scheme in such a
way that the measurement is minimally disturbing, i.e., it changes the state
vector \ket{\Psi} of the system to \sqrt{\Pi} \ket{\Psi} where \Pi is the
positive operator corresponding to the measured result.
  Using this method, we construct quantum circuits for measurements with
Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry. A continuous generalization leads to a scheme for
optimal simultaneous measurements of position and momentum of a Schr""odinger
particle moving in one dimension such that the outcomes satisfy \Delta x \Delta
p \geq \hbar.
  The particle to be measured collides with two probe particles, one for the
position and the other for the momentum measurement. The position and momentum
resolution can be tuned by the entangled joint state of the probe particles
which is also generated by a collision with hard-core potential. The parameters
of the POVM can then be controlled by the initial widths of the wave functions
of the probe particles. We point out some formal similarities and differences
to simultaneous measurements of quadrature amplitudes in quantum optics.
