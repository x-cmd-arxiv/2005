an extragalactic origin down to the ""second knee"" at ~4x10^{17}eV. In this case
the ""ankle"" or ""dip"" at ~5x10^{18}eV would be due to pair production of
extragalactic protons on the cosmic microwave background which requires an
injection spectrum of about E^{-2.6}. It has been pointed out that for
injection of a mixed composition of nuclei a harder injection spectrum
\~E^{-2.2} is required to fit the spectra at the highest energies and a
galactic component is required in this case to fit the spectrum below the
ankle, unless the proton fraction is larger than 85%. Here we perform numerical
simulations and find that for sufficiently magnetized sources, observed spectra
above 10^{19}eV approach again the case of pure proton injection due to
increased path-lengths and more efficient photo-disintegration of nuclei around
the sources. This decreases secondary fluxes at a given energy and thus
requires injection spectra ~E^{-2.6}, as steep as for pure proton injection. In
addition, the ankle may again be sufficiently dominated by protons to be
interpreted as a pair production dip.

rest-frame optical light in the range 0.5 to 0.8 um, where the effects of dust
extinction are smaller and the sensitivity to light from evolved stars is
greater than at shorter, rest-frame UV observable from the ground or with the

galaxies' stellar populations. We find that the SEDs for many of these galaxies
are best fitted by models of stellar populations with masses of a few x 1e10
M_sun, and with ages of a few hundred Myrs, values quite similar to those
derived for typical LBGs at z ~ 3. When the universe was only 1 Gyr old, some
galaxies had already formed a mass of stars approaching that of the present-day
Milky Way, and that they started forming those stars at z > 7, and in some
cases much earlier. We find that the lower limits to the space density for
galaxies in this mass range are consistent with predictions from recent
hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation in a LCDM universe. All objects
in our samples are consistent with having solar metallicity, suggesting that
they might have already been significantly polluted by metals. The values for
dust reddening derived from the model fitting are low or zero, and we find that
some of the galaxies have rest-frame UV colors that are even bluer than those
predicted by the stellar population models to which we compare them. These
colors might be attributed to the presence of very massive stars (> 100 M_sun),

strong optical emission lines. First, we study the emission-line properties of
a new hard X-ray selected sample of 47 local AGN (classified optically as both
Type 1 and Type 2 AGN). We find that the hard X- ray (3-20 keV) and
[OIII]$\lambda$5007 optical emission-line luminosities are well-correlated over
a range of about four orders-of-magnitude in luminosity (mean luminosity ratio
2.15 dex with a standard deviation of $\sigma$ = 0.51 dex). Second, we study
the hard X-ray properties of a sample of 55 local AGN selected from the
literature on the basis of the flux in the [OIII] line. The correlation between
the hard X-ray (2-10 keV) and [OIII] luminosity for the Type 1 AGN is
consistent with what is seen in the hard X-ray selected sample. However, the
Type 2 AGN have a much larger range in the luminosity ratio, and many are very
weak in hard X-rays (as expected for heavily absorbed AGN). We then compare the
hard X-ray (3-20 keV) and [OIII] luminosity functions of AGN in the local
universe. These have similar faint-end slopes with a luminosity ratio of 1.60
dex (0.55 dex smaller than the mean value for individual hard X-ray selected
AGN). We conclude that at low redshift, selection by narrow optical emission-
lines will recover most AGN selected by hard X-rays (with the exception of BL
Lac objects). However, selection by hard X-rays misses a significant fraction
of the local AGN population with strong emission lines.

formation, outward thru the host minihalo and into the surrounding gas. A
three-dimensional ray-tracing calculation tracks the I-front once the H II
region evolves a ""champagne flow'' inside the minihalo, after the early D-type
I-front detaches from the shock and runs ahead, becoming R-type. We take
account of the hydrodynamical back-reaction by an approximate model of the

reionization, we find that, for M_* > 80 M_sun, the ratio of gas mass ionized
to stellar mass is ~60,000, roughly half the number of ionizing photons
released per stellar baryon. Nearby minihalos are shown to trap the I-front, so
their centers remain neutral. This is contrary to the recent suggestion that
these stars would trigger formation of a second generation by fully ionizing
neighboring minihalos, stimulating H_2 formation in their cores. Finally, we
discuss how the evacuation of gas from the host halo reduces the growth and
luminosity of ""miniquasars'' that may form from black hole remnants of the

Sgr A*. The puzzling young stellar population is believed to come into
existence in one of the two ways:
  (i) ""normal"" star formation at several tens of parsec in a very massive star
cluster that then spiraled in, or (ii) star formation in situ in a massive
self-gravitating disk. We propose to constrain these two scenarios via the
expected X-ray emission from young low mass stars that should have formed
alongside the massive stars. To this end we compare the recent Chandra
observations of X-ray emission from young stars in the Orion Nebula, and the
Chandra observations of Sgr A* field. We show that the cluster inspiral model
is ruled out irrespectively of the initial mass function (IMF) of the young
stars. In addition, for the in situ model, we find that no more than few
thousand low-mass stars could have formed alongside the massive stars. This is
more than a factor of ten fewer than expected if these stars were formed with
the standard IMF as elsewhere in the Galaxy. The young stars in the GC are thus
the first solid observational evidence for star formation in AGN disks and also
require the IMF of these stars to be top-heavy. We briefly consider implication
of these results for AGN in general.

emission line at the nebular epoch with the shift of the maximum of -1600 km
s$^{-1}$. A similar asymmetric component is detected in H$\beta$, [O I] and [Ca

$^{56}$Ni ejecta. The H$\alpha$ profile and its evolution are reproduced in the
model of the asymmetric bipolar $^{56}$Ni and spherical hydrogen distributions.
The mass of the front $^{56}$Ni jet is comparable to the central component and
twice as larger compared to the rear $^{56}$Ni jet. We note that the asymmetric

find that the maximum value of the net recoil experienced by the binary due to
the inspiral phase up to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is of the
order of 22 km/s. We then estimate the kick velocity accumulated during the
plunge from the ISCO up to the horizon by integrating the momentum flux using
the 2PN formula along a plunge geodesic of the Schwarzschild metric. We find
that the contribution of the plunge dominates over that of the inspiral. For a
mass ratio m_2/m_1=1/8, we estimate a total recoil velocity (due to both
adiabatic and plunge phases) of 100 +/- 20 km/s. For a ratio 0.38, the recoil
is maximum and we estimate it to be 250 +/- 50 km/s. In the limit of small mass

additional external random force in the MHD system. Kinetic equation for the

Radioastron. The basic targets for microlensing searches should be bright
point-like radio sources at cosmological distances. In this case, an analysis
of their variability and a solid determination of microlensing could lead to an
estimation of their cosmological mass density, moreover, in this case one could
not exclude a possibility that non-baryonic dark matter also form microlenses
if the corresponding optical depth will be high enough. To search for
microlensing the most perspective objects are gravitational lensed systems as
usually, like CLASS gravitational lens B1600+434, for instance. However, for
direct resolving these images and direct detection of apparent motion of the
knots, a Radioastron sensitivity have to be improved, since an estimated flux
density is too low and to observe the phenomena one should improve sensitivity
in 10 times at 6 cm wavelength, for instance, otherwise, it is necessary to
increase an integration time (assuming that a radio source has a typical core
-- jet structure and microlensing phenomenon is caused superluminal apparent
motion of knots). Therefore, a launch of space interferometer Radioastron will
give new excellent facilities to investigate microlensing in radio band, since
in this case there is a possibility not only to resolve microimages but also
observe astrometric microlensing.

inflationary energy scale in the simplest curvaton model. A couple of
modifications to the simplest setup are explored, corresponding to the
implementation of a second (thermal) inflationary period whose end makes the
curvaton field `heavy', triggering either its oscillations or immediate decay.
Low scale inflation is then possible to attain with H_\ast being as low as 1
TeV. Among the statistical aspects, we study the bispectrum
B_\zeta(k_1,k_2,k_3) of the primordial curvature perturbation \zeta whose
normalisation \fnl gives information about the level of non-gaussianity in
\zeta. In connection with \fnl, several conserved and/or gauge invariant
quantities described as the second-order curvature perturbation have been given
in the literature. We review each of these quantities showing how to interpret
one in terms of the others, and analyze the respective expected \fnl in both
the inflaton and the curvaton scenarios as well as in other less known models
for the generation of primordial perturbations and/or non-gaussianities. The
\delta N formalism turns out to be a powerful technique to compute \fnl in
multi-component slow-roll inflation, as the knowledge of the evolution of some
family of unperturbed universes is the only requirement. We present for the

distribution by cutting various regions of over-density from the main sample;
unlike previous analyses, we find that our results are relatively robust to the
removal of the largest superclusters. We use our constraints on the K-band S_p
parameters in two ways. First, we examine their consistency with non-Gaussian
initial conditions; we are able to rule out strong non-Gaussianity in the
primordial density field, as might be seeded by topological defects such as
cosmic strings or global textures at the 2.5 sigma confidence level. Second, we
investigate the way in which galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution.

measurements, the average cluster-to-cluster velocity dispersion in 7 different
cluster aggregates (""knots"") is <10 \kms. The fact that this upper limit is
similar to the velocity dispersion of gas in the disks of typical spiral
galaxies suggests that the triggering mechanism for the formation of young
massive compact clusters (""super star clusters"") is unlikely to be high
velocity cloud-cloud collisions. On the other hand, models where preexisting
giant molecular clouds in the disks of spiral galaxies are triggered into
cluster formation are compatible with the observed low velocity dispersions.
These conclusions are consistent with those reached by Zhang et al. (2001)
based on comparisons between the positions of the clusters and the velocity and
density structure of the nearby interstellar medium. We find evidence for
systematically lower values of the line ratios [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha
in the bright central regions of some of the knots, relative to their outer
regions. This suggests that the harder ionizing photons are used up in the
regions nearest the clusters, and the diffuse ionized gas farther out is
photoionized by 'leakage' of the leftover low-energy photons. The low values of
the [SII]/H-alpha line ratio, typically [SII]/H-alpha<0.4, indicates that the
emission regions are photoionized rather than shock heated. The absence of
evidence for shock-heated gas is an additional indication that high velocity
cloud-cloud collisions are not playing a major role in the formation of the
young clusters.

production of a large number of positrons that annihilate. The origin of the
latter is debated, and they could be produced, in particular, by the (S- or

cumulated effect of similar sources at all redshifts could lead to a new

511 keV should be lower than about 4 keV/cm^2/s/sr. We also estimate
analytically the extragalactic background due to Dark Matter annihilation,
increasing the accuracy of the earlier computations. Indeed, we take into
account the large positron escape fraction from low mass dark matter halos,
unable to confine a dense and magnetized interstellar medium. Our new
background estimate turns out to be one order of magnitude lower, so that the
hypothesis of a light Dark Matter candidate remains compatible with the
observed extragalactic background for a wider range of particle masses and

$f^4J(T/J)^3$ which disappears at T=0, and a non-resonant term. The later term
diverges logarithmically as $\omega,T \to 0$. The static susceptibility
$\chi(0)$ has the free-spin-like contribution $1/(4T)$, and a logarithmic
correction proportional to $f^2\ln(J/T)$. The influence of finite concentration
of the defects $n$ on the low-temperature properties of AF is also
investigated. A logarithmic correction to spin-wave velocity of the form
$nf^4\ln|J/\omega|$ and an anomalous damping of spin waves proportional to
$nf^4|\omega|$ are obtained.

charge phases in strongly correlated 3d oxides. As a generic model system one
considers that of centers each with three possible valence states described in
frames of pseudo-spin (isospin) formalism by an effective anisotropic
non-Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Simple uniform mean-field phases include an
insulating monovalent phase, mixed-valence binary disproportionated phase, and
mixed-valence ternary under-disproportionated phase. We consider two first
phases in more details focusing on the problem of electron/hole states and
different types of excitons in monovalent phase and formation of electron-hole
Bose liquid in disproportionated phase. Pseudo-spin formalism provides a useful
framework for revealing and describing different topological charge
fluctuations, in particular, like domain walls or bubble domains in
antiferromagnets. All the insulating systems such as monovalent phase may be
subdivided to two classes: stable and unstable ones with regard to the
formation of self-trapped charge transfer (CT) excitons. The latter systems
appear to be unstable with regard to the formation of CT exciton clusters, or
droplets of the electron-hole Bose liquid. The model approach suggested is
believed to be applied to describe a physics of strongly correlated oxides with
charge transfer excitonic instability and a mixed valence. We shortly discuss
an unconventional scenario of the essential physics of cuprates and manganites
that implies their instability with regard to the self-trapping of charge
transfer excitons and the formation of electron-hole Bose liquid.

transfer (CT) electron-hole excitations in insulating cuprates in a rather wide
energy range up to 10- 15 eV. It generalizes the Zhang-Ng (ZN) model of CT
excitons by considering the complete set of Cu3d and O2p orbitals within the
CuO4 embedded molecular cluster method and by introducing one-center
(intra-center) Frenkel-like and two-center (inter-center) excitons. Special
attention is paid to the transition matrix element effects both in optical and
electron energy loss spectra (EELS). In the latter case we obtain the momentum
dependence of matrix elements both for intra-center and inter-center
transitions. We are able to give a semi-quantitative description of the optical
and EELS spectra for a large number of 0D (like CuB2O4), 1D (Sr2CuO3) and 2D
(like Sr2CuO2Cl2) insulating cuprates in a unifying manner. By comparing our
analysis with the experimental data we find that the CT gap in insulating
cuprates is determined by nearly degenerate intra-center localized excitations
and inter-center CT excitons. The corresponding EELS intensity is found to be
strongly k-dependent: even for isolated exciton it sharply decreases by
approaching the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary. It is shown that the interaction
of two-center excitons can result in destructive interference effects with an
intensity compensation point.

Einstein gravitational blue shift effect of the satellite clock frequency
(Equivalence Principle of General Relativity) and the Doppler red shift of
second order, due to the motion of the satellite (Special Relativity).

the GPS system unless an alternative project is designed. In this work, it will
be also shown that the SYPOR project, using fully relativistic concepts, is an

calculate the total cross sections and the transverse momentum distributions at
next-to-leading order in QCD. The NLO corrections enhance the total cross
sections and decrease the dependence of the total cross sections on the
factorization and renormalization scales. For the differential cross sections,
we resum all order soft gluon effects to give reliable predictions for the
transverse momentum distributions. We also compare two approaches to the
non-perturbative parametrization and found that the results are slightly
different at the Tevatron and are in good agreement at the LHC. Our results can
be useful to the simulation of the events and to the future collider

Enstrophy invariants are Casimirs of the Poisson algebra of gauge invariant

Hamiltonian is a magnetic energy, similar to that of electrodynamics, and
depends on a metric whose volume element is not a multiple of mu. The magnetic
field evolves by a quadratically non-linear `Euler' equation, which may also be
regarded as describing geodesic flow on SDiff(M,mu). Static solutions are
obtained. For uniform mu, an infinite sequence of local conserved charges

involution, suggesting integrability. Besides being a theory of a novel kind of

dimensions using Toda field equations associated to continual Lie algebras that
incorporate the deformation variable t into their system. The Ricci flow admits
zero curvature formulation in terms of an infinite dimensional algebra with
Cartan operator d/dt. Likewise, the Calabi flow arises as Toda field equation
associated to a supercontinual algebra with odd Cartan operator d/d \theta -
\theta d/dt. Thus, taking the square root of the Cartan operator allows to
connect the two distinct classes of geometric deformations of second and fourth
order, respectively. The algebra is also used to construct formal solutions of
the Calabi flow in terms of free fields by Backlund transformations, as for the
Ricci flow. Some applications of the present framework to the general class of
Robinson-Trautman metrics that describe spherical gravitational radiation in
vacuum in four space-time dimensions are also discussed. Further iteration of
the algorithm allows to construct an infinite hierarchy of higher order
geometric flows, which are integrable in two dimensions and they admit
immediate generalization to Kahler manifolds in all dimensions. These flows
provide examples of more general deformations introduced by Calabi that
preserve the Kahler class and minimize the quadratic curvature functional for
extremal metrics.

the information remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation.
Using recent results in quantum information theory, we find that the amount of
information that must remain in the black hole until the final stages of
evaporation can be very small, even though the amount already radiated away is
negligible. Quantum effects mean that information need not be additive: a small
number of quanta can lock a large amount of information, making it
inaccessible. When this small number of locking quanta are finally emitted, the
full information (and unitarity) is restored. Only if the number of initial
states is restricted will the locking mechanism leak out information early.

Fuglede and Ohtsuka, to a systematic treatment of rendezvous numbers. We
introduced energies, Chebyshev constants as two variable set functions, and the
modified notion of rendezvous intervals which proved to be rather nicely
behaved even for only lower semicontinuous kernels or for not necessarily
compact metric spaces.
  Here we study the rendezvous and average numbers of possibly infinite
dimensional normed spaces. It turns out that very general existence and
uniqueness results hold for the modified rendezvous numbers in all Banach
spaces. We also observe the connections of these ""magical numbers"" to Chebyshev
constants, Chebyshev radius and entropy. Applying the developed notions with
the available methods we calculate the rendezvous numbers or rendezvous
intervals of certain concrete Banach spaces. In particular, a satisfactory
description of the case of L_p spaces is obtained for all p>0.

the missing mass spectrum of the quasi-free pn --> pnX reaction constitutes
a~challenging task when the reaction is studied close to threshold. This is
especially true if the resolution of the mass determination is comparable with
the excess energy and if the investigated signal appears close to the
kinematical limit. In this article we outline a method which permits the
extraction of the signal originating from the creation of a single meson
without the necessity of conducting model-dependent simulations. For the pd -->
pnXp(spectator) reactions, the method allows one to combine events
corresponding to multi-meson production at various excess energies with respect
to the pn --> pn meson process, and hence leads to an increase of the
statistics needed for the determination of the shape of the multi-meson
background.
  As an example of the application of the method, we demonstrate that the
evaluation of the data from the pd --> pnXp(sp) process according to the
described technique enables one to extract a signal of the pn --> pn eta
reaction whose shape is consistent with expectations, supporting the
correctness and usefulness of the method introduced.

scenario of heavy-ion collisions in that as the temperature approaches the
critical temperature $T_c$ of chiral restoration from below, the mass of the
vector mesons and their widths go to zero in the chiral limit or nearly zero
otherwise, proportionally to some power of the quark condensate at what is

prediction that as the fire-ball expands and cools from $T_c$ down toward the
freezeout temperature $T_{freezeout}$ in heavy ion collisions, what we call
""hadronic freedom"" sets in in which hadrons do not interact or barely interact.

provide an astonishingly simple explanation in terms of the vector
manifestation suitably extended to include axial-vector mesons for the
anomalously large $\rho^0/\pi^-$ ratio measured in peripheral collisions by

physics are applied to the tensor one-pion exchange potential to determine the
regions in which it can be treated perturbatively. In S-, P- and D-waves the
critical values of the relative momentum are less than or of the order of 400
MeV. The RG is then used to determine the power counting for short-range
interaction in the presence of this potential. In the P-and D-waves, where
there are no low-energy bound or virtual states, these interactions have
half-integer RG eigenvalues and are substantially promoted relative to naive
expectations. These results are independent of whether the tensor force is
attractive or repulsive. In the 3S1 channel the leading term is relevant, but
it is demoted by half an order compared to the counting for the effective-range
expansion with only a short-range potential. The tensor force can be treated
perturbatively in those F-waves and above that do not couple to P- or D-waves.

fluctuations of local electromagnetic field in random fractal aggregates of
silver nanospheres are strongly correlated with a local anisotropy factor S
which is defined in this paper. The latter is a purely geometrical parameter
which characterizes the deviation of local environment of a given nanosphere in
an aggregate from spherical symmetry. Therefore, it is possible to predict the
sites with anomalously large local fields in an aggregate without explicitly
solving the electromagnetic problem. We have also demonstrated that the average
(over nanospheres) value of S does not depend noticeably on the fractal
dimension D, except when D approaches the trivial limit D=3. In this case, as
one can expect, the average local environment becomes spherically symmetrical
and S approaches zero. This corresponds to the well-known fact that in trivial
aggregates fluctuations of local electromagnetic fields are much weaker than in
fractal aggregates. Thus, we find that, within the quasistatics, the
large-scale geometry does not have a significant impact on local
electromagnetic responses in nanoaggregates in a wide range of fractal
dimensions. However, this prediction is expected to be not correct in
aggregates which are sufficiently large for the intermediate- and
radiation-zone interaction of individual nanospheres to become important.

large, the sheet can itself become tearing-mode unstable, giving rise to
secondary islands, which then coalesce with the original island. The saturated
state depends on the value of Delta'. For small Delta', the saturation
amplitude is ~Delta' and quantitatively agrees with the theoretical prediction.

example, in the quantum periodically-driven kicked rotor. It is due to subtle
quantum destructive interferences and is thus of intrinsic quantum origin. It
has been shown that deviation from strict periodicity in the driving rapidly
destroys dynamical localization. We report experimental results showing that
this destruction is partially reversible when the deterministic perturbation
that destroyed it is slowly reversed. We also provide an explanation for the
partial character of the reversibility.

protein A regulates the transcription of protein B and the two proteins form a
heterodimer. It has been found to be statistically over-represented in
statistical analyses of gene and protein interaction databases and to lie at
the core of several computer-generated genetic networks. Here, we propose and
mathematically study a model of the MFL and show that, by itself, it can serve
both as a bistable switch and as a clock (an oscillator) depending on kinetic
parameters. The MFL phase diagram as well as a detailed description of the
nonlinear oscillation regime are presented and some biological examples are
discussed. The results emphasize the role of protein interactions in the
function of genetic modules and the usefulness of modelling RNA dynamics

maximally-entangled Bell state with a certain probablility. We also consider
two further protocols, one based on simple repetition and the other based on
successive measurements and conditional resetting, and show that the cumulative
probability of creating a Bell state between Alice and Bob tends to unity.

define, in each cavity, a dichotomic operator expressible in terms of the field
states which can be, in principle, experimentally measured by a probe atom that
``reads'' the field. Using the quantum correlations of couples of these
operators, we construct a Bell's inequality which is shown to be violated for a
wide range of the degree of entanglement and which can be tested in a simple
way. Thus the cavity fields directly show quantum non-local properties. A
scheme is also sketched to generate entangled orthogonal generalized Bernoulli
states in the two separate cavities.

Pritchard's experiment, we have made several improvements which are described
in detail in this paper: the capacitor design is such that the electric field
can be calculated analytically; the phase sensitivity of our interferometer is
substantially better, near 16 mrad/$\sqrt{Hz}$; finally our interferometer is
species selective it so that impurities present in our atomic beam (other
alkali atoms or lithium dimers) do not perturb our measurement. The extreme
sensitivity of atom interferometry is well illustrated by our experiment: our
measurement amounts to measuring a slight increase $\Delta v$ of the atom
velocity $v$ when it enters the electric field region and our present
sensitivity is sufficient to detect a variation $\Delta v/v \approx 6 \times
10^{-13}$.

method is based upon purification of a density matrix by its uniform
decomposition and a generalization of the parallel transport condition obtained
from this decomposition. It is shown that the generalized parallel transport
condition can be satisfied when Uhlmann's condition holds. However, it does not
mean that all solutions of the generalized parallel transport condition are
compatible with those of Uhlmann's one. It is also shown how to recover the
earlier known definitions of geometric phase as well as how to generalize them
