NGC4321, NGC4826, NGC4579 and NGC6951. These galaxies have been observed as
part of the NUGA CO project, aimed at the study of AGN fueling mechanisms. Our
calculations allow us to derive the characteristic time-scales for gas flows
and discuss whether torques from the stellar potentials are efficient enough to
drain the gas angular momentum in the inner 1 kpc of these galaxies. Results
indicate paradoxically that feeding should be thwarted close to the AGN: in the
four cases analyzed, gravity torques are mostly positive inside r~200pc,
resulting in no inflow on these scales. As a possible solution for the paradox,
we speculate that the agent responsible for driving inflow to still smaller
radii is transient and thus presently absent in the stellar potential.
Alternatively, the gravity torque barrier associated with the ILR of the bars
in these galaxies could be overcome by other mechanisms that become competitive
in due time against gravity torques. We find that viscosity can counteract
moderate--to--low gravity torques on the gas if it acts on a nuclear ring of
high gas surface density contrast and a few 100pc size. We propose an
evolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in concert to
produce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime of any
galaxy. In this scenario the recurrence of activity in galaxies is indirectly
related to that of the bar instabilities.

geometries on the polarized flux. We introduce a new, publicly available Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code, Stokes, which models polarization induced by
scattering off free electrons and dust grains. We find that the shape of the
funnel of the dusty torus has a significant impact on the polarization
efficiency. A compact torus with a steep inner surface scatters more light
toward type-2 viewing angles than a large torus of the same half-opening angle,
theta0. For theta0 < 53 deg, the scattered light is polarized perpendicularly
to the symmetry axis, whilst for theta0 > 60 deg it is polarized parallel to
the symmetry axis. In between these intervals the orientation of the
polarization depends on the viewing angle. The degree of polarization ranges
between 0% and 20% and is wavelength-independent for a large range of theta0.
Observed wavelength-independent optical and near-UV polarization thus does not
necessarily imply electron scattering. For polar dust, scattering spectra are
reddened for type-1 viewing angles, and made bluer for type-2 viewing angles.
Polar electron-scattering cones are very efficient polarizers at type-2 viewing
angles, whilst the polarized flux of the torus is weak. We predict that the net
polarization of Seyfert-2 galaxies decreases with luminosity, and conclude that
the degree of polarization should be correlated with the relative strength of
the thermal IR flux. We find that a flattened, equatorial, electron-scattering
disk, of relatively low optical depth, reproduces type-1 polarization. This is
insensitive to the exact geometry, but the observed polarization requires a
limited range of optical depth.

2.5 um have been obtained along the HH1 jet and analysed in order to explore
the potential of a combined optical/near-IR diagnostic applied to jets from
young stellar objects. Important physical parameters have been derived along
the jet using various diagnostic line ratios. This multi-line analysis shows,
in each spatially unresolved knot, the presence of zones at different
excitation conditions, as expected from the cooling layers behind a shock
front. In particular, a density stratification in the jet is evident from
ratios of various lines of different critical density. In particular, [FeII]
lines originate in a cooling layer located at larger distances from the shock
front than that generating the optical lines, where the compression is higher
and the temperature is declining. The derived parameters were used to measure
the mass flux along the jet, adopting different procedures, the advantages and
limitations of which are discussed. dM/dt is high in the initial part of the
flow but decreases by about an order of magnitude further out. Conversely, the
mass flux associated with the warm molecular material is low and does not show
appreciable variations along the jet. We suggest that part of the mass flux in
the external regions is not revealed in optical and IR lines because it is
associated with a colder atomic component, which may be traced by the far-IR [O
I]63 um line.
  Finally, we find that the gas-phase abundance of refractory species is lower
than the solar value suggesting that a significant fraction of dust grains may
still be present in the jet beam.

density fluctuations are small, the evolution of the sound speed squared,
$c_s^2$, is fully coupled to the evolution of the scale factor and that the
transition from the dark matter to the dark energy dominated epoch is faster
(slower) than in a standard $\Lambda$CDM model if $c_s^2 > 0$ ($c_s^2 < 0$). In
particular, we show that the mapping of the simplest quintessence scenario with
constant $w_Q \equiv p_Q/ \rho_Q$ into a unified dark energy model requires
$c_s^2 < 0$ at the present time (if $w_Q > -1$) contrasting to the Chaplygin
gas scenario where one has $c_s^2 > 0$. However, we show that non-linear
effects severely complicate the analysis, in particular rendering linear
results invalid even on large cosmological scales. Although a detailed analysis
of non-linear effects requires solving the full Einstein field equations, some
general properties can be understood in simple terms. In particular, we find
that in the context of Chaplygin gas models the transition from the dark matter
to the dark energy dominated era may be anticipated with respect to linear
expectations leading to a background evolution similar to that of standard
$\Lambda$CDM models. On the other hand, in models with $c_s^2 > 0$ the expected
transition from the decelerating to the accelerating phase may never happen.

human error, intensive monitoring did not begin until 43 minutes after peak, at
which point the magnification had fallen to A~1200, still by far the highest
ever observed. As the light curve does not show significant deviations due to a
planet, we place upper limits on the presence of such planets by extending the
method of Yoo et al. (2004b), which combines light-curve analysis with priors
from a Galactic model of the source and lens populations, to take account of
finite-source effects. This is the first event so analyzed for which
finite-source effects are important, and hence we develop two new techniques
for evaluating these effects. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that
OGLE-2004-BLG-343 is no more sensitive to planets than two previously analyzed
events with A_{max}~100, despite the fact that it was observed at ~12 times
higher magnification. However, we show that had the event been observed over

a factor of 5 of projected separation and even would have had some sensitivity
to Earth-mass planets. This shows that some microlensing events being detected

effects of seeing, slit width, and observational uncertainties. From an
analysis of the small number of available rotation curves for LBGs we determine
a relation Vc7=(1.9+/-0.2)sigma between circular velocity at a radius of 7kpc,
and central line velocity width. We use this relation to transform the measured
velocity widths of 32 LBGs to the distribution of circular velocities, for the
population of LBGs brighter than R=25.5. We compare this distribution against
the predicted distribution for the 'massive-halo' model in which LBGs pinpoint
all of the highest mass dark matter haloes at that epoch. The observed LBG
circular velocities are smaller than the predicted circular velocities by a
factor >1.4+/-0.15. This is a lower limit as we have ignored any increase of
circular velocity caused by baryonic dissipation. The massive-halo model
predicts a median halo virial mass of 10^12.3 Msol, and a small spread of
circular velocities. Our median estimated dynamical mass is <10^(11.6+/-0.3)
Msol, which is significantly smaller; furthermore, the spread of our circular
velocities is much larger than the massive-halo prediction. These results are
consistent with a picture which leaves some of the most-massive haloes
available for occupation by other populations which do not meet the LBG
selection criteria. The median halo mass recently estimated by Adelberger et
al. from the measured clustering of LBGs is 10^(11.86+/-0.3) Msol. Our
dynamical analysis appears to favour lower masses and to be more in line with
the median mass predicted by the collisional starburst model of Somerville et
al., of 10^11.3 Msol. [abridged]

CIV and OVI absorption in the spectrum of quasar Q1422+231 in regions of the
spectrum close to and far from galaxies at z ~ 3. This is achieved both by
using the positions of observed Lyman break galaxies and by using strong CIV
absorption as a proxy for the presence of galaxies near the line of sight. We
find that the metal line absorption is a strong function of not only the HI
optical depth (and thus gas density) but also proximity to highly enriched
regions (and so proximity to galaxies). The parameter ``proximity to galaxies''
can account for some, but not all, of the scatter in the strength of CIV
absorption for fixed HI. Finally, we find that even if we limit our analysis to
the two thirds of the pixels that are at least 600 km/s from any CIV line that
is strong enough to detect unambiguously (tau_CIV > 0.1), our statistical
analysis reveals only slightly less CIV for fixed HI than when we analyze the
whole spectrum. We conclude that while the metallicity is enhanced in regions
close to (Lyman-break) galaxies, the enrichment is likely to be much more
widespread than their immediate surroundings.

without any sign of on-going star formation - have recently been shown to exist
preferentially in cluster infalling regions. This discovery directly connects
passive spiral galaxies to cluster galaxy evolution studies, such as the
Butcher-Oemler effect or the morphology-density relation. Thus, detailed study
of passive spiral galaxies could potentially yield new insight on the
underlying physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution.
  However, in previous work, passive spiral galaxies were selected from
low-resolution optical images with $\sim$1.5 arcsec seeing. Passive spirals
could therefore be mis-identified as S0 galaxies, or as dusty-starburst
galaxies which are not passive at all. To address this issue we performed deep,
high-resolution, near-infrared imaging of 32 passive spiral galaxies with

larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta-model, showing
continuous steepening with radius. The derived rho_tot profiles and their
scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with
concentration expected for dark matter halos in LambdaCDM cosmology. In the
inner region (r<0.1r_500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit
significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar
at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the

is oriented nearly perpendicular to the nuclear jet. We model the central
rotation and velocity dispersion curves of the [FeII] gas orbiting in the
combined potential of the stellar mass and the (dominant) black hole. Our
physically most plausible model, a dynamically hot and geometrically thin gas
disk, yields a black hole mass of M_bh = (6.1 +0.6/-0.8) 10^7 M_sun. As the
physical state of the gas is not well understood, we also consider two limiting
cases: first a cold disk model, which completely neglects the velocity
dispersion; it yields an M_bh estimate that is almost two times lower. The
other extreme case is to model a spherical gas distribution in hydrostatic
equilibrium through Jeans equation. Compared to the hot disk model the best-fit
black hole mass increases by a factor of 1.5. This wide mass range spanned by
the limiting cases shows how important the gas physics is even for high
resolution data. Our overall best-fitting black hole mass is a factor of 2-4
lower than previous measurements. With our revised M_bh estimate, Cen A's
offset from the M_bh-sigma relation is significantly reduced; it falls above
this relation by a factor of ~2, which is close to the intrinsic scatter of

two-sample tests show that g-r and r-i colour gradient distributions of E+A

colour gradients and colours, and between radial colour gradients and the
4000-\AA break in the E+A sample; E+A galaxies which exhibit bluer colour or
weaker D4000 tend to have positive slopes of radial colour gradient. We
compared the GISSEL model and E+A observational quantities, Hdelta EW, D4000

single evolutionary track. Therefore, these results are interpreted as E+A
galaxies evolving from Hdelta EW ~ 8 \AA to Hdelta EW ~ 5 \AA, with colour
gradients changing from positive to negative, and with the irregular 2D colour
map becoming smoother, during a time-scale of ~300 Myr. Our results favour the
hypothesis that E+A galaxies are post-starburst galaxies caused by

pronounced in the Southern galactic hemisphere. Removal of the region of sky

Analysis of individual frequency maps shows strongest signal in the 41GHz Q

increases with increasing wire length or decreasing temperature. This can be
qualitatively explained using the Born approximation in scattering theory. For
a strong impurity, the conductance is significantly different for a repulsive

information paradox: the shells bounce and re-expand and the evolution is
unitary. The corresponding scattering times will be defined in the present
paper. To this aim, a spherical mirror of radius R_m is introduced. The
classical formula for scattering times of the shell reflected from the mirror
is extended to quantum theory. The scattering times and their spreads are
calculated. They have a regular limit for R_m\to 0 and they reveal a resonance
at E_m = c^4R_m/2G. Except for the resonance, they are roughly of the order of
the time the light needs to cross the flat space distance between the observer

differently from low p_t, evolution will induce correlations in x in the
multiparton structure functions. We have estimated the cross section of
multiple production of W bosons with equal sign, where the correlations in x
induced by evolution are particularly relevant, and the cross section of
b-bar_b b-bar_b production, where the effects of evolution are much smaller.
Our result is that, in the case of multiple production of W bosons, the terms
with correlations may represent a correction of the order of 40% of the cross

from the AdS_5 x S5 by a combination of T-dualities and shifts of angular
coordinates. It depends on three real parameters gamma_i which determine the
shape of the deformed 5-sphere. The dual gauge theory has the same field
content as N=4 SYM theory, but with scalar and Yukawa interactions ``deformed''
by gamma_i-dependent phases. The special case of equal deformation parameters
gamma_i=gamma corresponds to the N=1 supersymmetric deformation. We compare the
energies of semiclassical strings with three large angular momenta to the
1-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding gauge-theory scalar operators
and find that they match as it was the case in the SU(3) sector of the standard
AdS/CFT duality. In the supersymmetric case of equal gamma_i this extends the
result of our previous work (hep-th/0503192) from the 2-spin to the 3-spin
sector. This extension turns out to be quite nontrivial. To match the
corresponding low-energy effective ``Landau-Lifshitz'' actions on the string
theory and the gauge theory sides one is to make a special choice of the spin
chain Hamiltonian representing the 1-loop gauge theory dilatation operator.

the volume extensive heat bath entropy of the lightfront algebra. Apart from a
change of parametrization the infinite lighlike length contribution to the
lightfront volume factor corresponds to the short-distance divergence of the
area density of the localization entropy. This correspondence is a consequence
of the conformal invariance of the lightfront holography combined with the
well-known fact that in conformality relates short to long distances. In the
explicit calculation of the strength factor we use the temperature duality

geometries of k coincident non-extremal NS5-branes, where 1/k measures
curvature of the backgrounds in string unit and hence size of string worldsheet
effects. At classical level, string worldsheet effects are suppressed and
D0-brane propagation in the Lorentzian black hole geometry is simply given by
the Wick rotation of D1-brane contour in the Euclidean black hole geometry.
Taking account of string worldsheet effects, boundary state of the Lorentzian
D0-brane is formally constructible via Wick rotation from that of the Euclidean
D1-brane. However, the construction is subject to ambiguities in boundary
conditions. We propose exact boundary states describing the D0-brane, and
clarify physical interpretations of various boundary states constructed from
different boundary conditions. As it falls into the black hole, the D0-brane
radiates off to the horizon and to the infinity. From the boundary states
constructed, we compute physical observables of such radiative process. We find
that part of the radiation to infinity is in effective thermal distribution at
the Hawking temperature. We also find that part of the radiation to horizon is
in the Hagedorn distribution, dominated by massive, highly non-relativistic
closed string states, much like the tachyon matter. Remarkably, such
distribution emerges only after string worldsheet effects are taken exactly
into account. From these results, we observe that nature of the radiation
distribution changes dramatically across the conifold geometry k=1 (k=3 for the
bosonic case), exposing the `string - black hole transition' therein.

space-time filling D-branes lead to Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications.
For a generic Calabi-Yau orientifold theory with space-time filling D3- or

effective N=1 supergravity action which describes in the low-energy regime the
massless open and closed string modes of the underlying type IIB Calabi-Yau

particular spontaneous supersymmetry breaking induced by non-trivial background
fluxes is studied. For D3-brane scenarios we compute soft-supersymmetry
breaking terms resulting from bulk background fluxes whereas for D7-brane
systems we investigate the structure of D- and F-terms originating from
worldvolume D7-brane background fluxes. Finally we relate the geometric

directional functionals to the problem of definability. In this addendum we
provide a concept of breakdown defined in terms of definability and not in
terms of bias. If a group of finite order $k$ acts on the sample space we show
that the breakdown point can be bounded above by $(k-1)/k$. In the case of
directional data there is a group of order $k=2$ giving an upper bound of 1/2.

neighbor site corresponding to the minimal distance to its destination. The
stochasticity or noise ($p$) is introduced in the model dynamics, through the
uncertainty in estimating the distance from the destination. The friction
parameter $""\mu""$ is also introduced to control the probability that the
movement of all agents involved to the same site (conflict) is denied at one
time step. This model displays two states; namely the freely moving and the
jamming state. If $\mu$ is large and $p$ is low, the system is in the jamming
state even if the density is low. However, if $\mu$ is large and $p$ is high, a
freely moving state takes place whenever the density is low. The cluster size
and the travel time distributions in the two states are studied in detail. We
find that only very small clusters are present in the freely moving state while
the jamming state displays a bimodal distribution. At low densities, agents can
take a very long time to reach their destinations if $\mu$ is large and $p$ is
low (jamming state); but long travel times are suppressed if $p$ becomes large
(freely moving state).

earthquakes (with magnitudes below the detection threshold $m_d$) may play a
significant and perhaps dominant role in triggering future seismicity. Using
the ETAS branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of
generating probability functions to investigate how the statistical properties
of observable earthquakes differ from the statistics of all events. The ETAS
(epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model assumes that each earthquake can
trigger other earthquakes (``aftershocks''). An aftershock sequence results in
this model from the cascade of aftershocks of each past earthquake. The
triggering efficiency of earthquakes is assumed to vanish below a lower
magnitude limit $m_0$, in order to ensure the convergence of the theory and may
reflect the physics of state-and-velocity frictional rupture. We show that, to
a good approximation, the ETAS model is renormalized onto itself under what
amounts to a decimation procedure $m_0 \to m_d$, with just a renormalization of
the branching ratio from $n$ to an effective value $n(m_d)$. Our present
analysis thus confirms, for the full statistical properties, the results
obtained previously by one of us and Werner, based solely on the average
seismic rates (the first-order moment of the statistics). However, our analysis
also demonstrates that this renormalization is not exact, as there are small
corrections which can be systematically calculated, in terms of additional
contributions that can be mapped onto a different branching model (a new
relevant direction in the language of the renormalization group).

choice of its parameters. By proving the optimality of the well known reduction
map and combining it with the optimal and non-decomposable 3 $\otimes$ 3 BDEW
(named critical entanglement witnesses) the family of optimal and
non-decomposable 3 $\otimes$ 3 BDEW have also been obtained. Using the
approximately critical entanglement witnesses, some 3 $\otimes$ 3 bound
entangled states are so detected. So the well known Choi map as a particular
case of the positive map in connection with this witness via Jamiolkowski
isomorphism has been considered which approximately is obtained via linear
programming.

entangled states in quantum optical systems are introduced. Each is evaluated
in terms of realistic models of the imperfect apparatus of any real laboratory
implementation. The first half of the thesis considers entanglement generation
in Cavity QED, introducing several proposals for the creation of maximally
entangled two-qubit states. The second half of the thesis focuses on the
manipulation of entangled states of light pulses. In particular, an
entanglement distillation procedure for Gaussian states is introduced. This
combines a Procrustean protocol for the generation of highly entangled
non-Gaussian states, with a ""Gaussification"" procedure, which allows more
highly entangled approximately Gaussian states to be distilled from a
non-Gaussian supply.

In addition, we calculate the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy, the
Jensen-Shannon divergence, Onicescu's information energy and a complexity
measure recently proposed. Shell effects at closed shells atoms are observed.
The complexity measure shows local minima at the closed shells atoms indicating
that for the above atoms complexity decreases with respect to neighboring
atoms. It is seen that complexity fluctuates around an average value,
indicating that the atom cannot grow in complexity as Z increases. Onicescu's
information energy is correlated with the ionization potential. Kullback
distance and Jensen-Shannon distance are employed to compare
Roothaan-Hartree-Fock density distributions with other densities of previous
works.

Furthermore, we also use this method to classify the entangled states that can
be inter-converted through stochastic local operations and classical

consider the time as an observable, and thus could, in principle, have the
