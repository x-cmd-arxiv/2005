of 1000 solar masses, and a donor star more massive than 15 solar masses. These
systems experience an active X-ray phase characterized by luminosities varying
over a wide interval, from <10^36 erg/s up to a few 10^40 erg/s typical of the
ultra luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Roche lobe overflow on the zero-age main
sequence and donor masses above 20 solar masses can maintain a long-lived
accretion phase at the level required to feed a ULX source. In wide systems,
wind transfer rates are magnified by the focusing action of the IMBH yielding
wind luminosities around 10^38 erg/s. These high mass-IMBH binaries can be
identified as progenitors of IMBH-radio pulsar (PSR) binaries. We find that the
formation of an IMBH-PSR binary does not necessarely require the transit
through a ULX phase, but that a ULX can highlight a system that will evolve
into an IMBH-PSR, if the mass of the donor star is constrained to lie within 15
to 30 solar masses. We show that binary evolution delivers the pre-exploding
helium core in an orbit such that after explosion, the neutron star has a very
high probability to remain bound to the IMBH, at distances of 1-10 AU. The
detection of an IMBH-PSR binary in the Milky Way has suffered, so far, from the
same small number of statistics limit affecting the population of ULXs in our
Galaxy. Ongoing deeper surveys or next generation radio telescopes like SKA
will have an improved chance to unveil such intriguing systems. Timing analysis
of a pulsar orbiting around an IMBH would weigh the black hole in the still
uncharted interval of mass around 1000 solar masses

magnetic fields, is of great interest in astrophysical plasmas, but occurs on
spatial scales far too small to resolve by remote sensing, e.g., at ~ 1-100 cm
in the solar corona. This paper reports spatially resolved observations that
offer strong support for the presence in solar flares of a suspected radio
emission mechanism, resonant transition radiation, which is tightly coupled to
the level of microturbulence and provides direct diagnostics of the existence
and level of fluctuations on decimeter spatial scales. Although the level of
the microturbulence derived from the radio data is not particularly high,
<\Delta n^2 >/n^2 ~ 10^{-5}$, it is large enough to affect the charged particle
diffusion and give rise to effective stochastic acceleration. This finding has
exceptionally broad astrophysical implications since modern sophisticated
numerical models predict generation of much stronger turbulence in relativistic
objects, e.g., in gamma-ray burst sources.

around AGN has been a long-standing, unsolved problem. It has been previously
suggested that protons, in conjunction with the turbulent magnetic field that
is likely to exist in the accretion disk, might be crucial in providing this
viscosity. Several authors have recently determined diffusion coefficients for
charged particles (cosmic rays) propagating in turbulent magnetic fields by
means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We use the diffusion coefficients
for protons determined by these simulations to find the effective mean free
path for protons in hot accretion disks. This in turn yields good estimates of
the viscosity due to energetic protons embedded in the turbulent magnetic field
of a hot, two-temperature accretion disk. We combine this with a simple
two-temperature accretion disk model to determine the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$
viscosity parameter arising out of this mechanism. We find that protons
diffusing in the turbulent magentic field embedded in a hot accretion d isk
provide a physically reasonable source of viscosity in hot accretion disks

3-Branes can be formulated in a conformally invariant way if the embedding
space is six-dimensional. The implementation of conformal invariance requires
the use of a modified measure, independent of the metric in the action. We here
generalize the theory to include conformal invariance breaking and a dynamical
scalar field with a non-trivial potential. The non conformal invariance
contribution can be interpreted as originating from a continious ""non ideal
brane fluid"" that exists between two singular branes. The scalar field
potential also breaks the conformal invariance. At singular brane locations,
conformal invariance is restored and the dynamics of the scalar field is frozen
at a certain fixed value of the scalar field which depends on an arbitrary
integration constant. Spontaneous Symmetry breaking can take place due to such
boundary condition without the need of invoking tachyonic mass terms for the
scalar field. In these Brane-world scenarios, zero 4-D cosmological constant is
achieved without the need of invoking a fine tuned cosmological constant in 6D.
Thus, no ``old'' cosmological constant problem appears. The use of a measure
independent of the metric is crucial for obtaining all of the above results.

"physics/0507071","Alexander Zhalij","Georgy Burde and Alexander Zhalij","Separable unsteady nonparallel flow stability problems","21 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  The so-called 'direct' approach to separation of variables in linear PDEs is
applied to the hydrodynamic stability problem. Calculations are made for the
complete linear stability equations in cylindrical coordinates. Several classes
of the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations describing spatially
developing and unsteady flows, for which the linear stability problems can be
rigorously reduced to eigenvalue problems of ordinary differential equations,
are defined. Those exactly solvable nonparallel and unsteady flow stability
problems can be used for testing approximate approaches and the methods based
on direct numerical simulations of the (linearized) Navier-Stokes equations.
The exact solutions of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
determined as the basic states, for which the linear stability problem is
exactly separable, may be themselves of interest from theoretical and
engineering points of view.

  1-4, 2005, Prague, Czech Republic",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.OT",,"  We report measurements of the brain activity of subjects engaged in
behavioral exchanges with their environments. We observe brain states which are
characterized by coordinated oscillation of populations of neurons that are
changing rapidly with the evolution of the meaningful relationship between the
subject and its environment, established and maintained by active perception.
Sequential spatial patterns of neural activity with high information content
found in sensory cortices of trained animals between onsets of conditioned
stimuli and conditioned responses resemble cinematographic frames. They are not
readily amenable to description either with classical integrodifferential
equations or with the matrix algebras of neural networks. Their modeling is
provided by field theory from condensed matter physics.

two different cell types (mother cell and prespore) from a single cell. The
mechanism by which the two different developmental programs are initiated has
been much studied but is not well understood. With the help of existing and new
experimental results, a mathematical model has been developed that reproduces
all published in vitro experiments and makes new predictions about the
properties of the system in vivo.

optical high-finesse resonator allows to produce entangled multi-photon light
pulses on demand. The mechanism is based on the mechanical effect of light. The
degree of entanglement can be controlled through the parameters of the laser
excitation. Experimental realization of the scheme is within reach of current
technology. A variation of the technique allows for controlled generation of
entangled subsequent pulses, with the atomic motion serving as intermediate
memory of the quantum state.

problem: the states are grouped in sets and we want to determine to which
particular set a given input state belongs.The simplest case, when the N given
states are divided into two subsets and the first set consists of one state
only while the second consists of all of the remaining states, is termed
quantum state filtering. We derived previously the optimal strategy for the
case of N non-orthogonal states, {|\psi_{1} >, ..., |\psi_{N} >}, for
distinguishing |\psi_1 > from the set {|\psi_2 >, ..., |\psi_N >} and the
corresponding optimal success and failure probabilities. In a previous paper
[PRL 90, 257901 (2003)], we sketched an appplication of the results to
probabilistic quantum algorithms. Here we fill in the gaps and give the
complete derivation of the probabilstic quantum algorithm that can optimally
distinguish between two classes of Boolean functions, that of the balanced
functions and that of the biased functions. The algorithm is probabilistic, it
fails sometimes but when it does it lets us know that it did. Our approach can
be considered as a generalization of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that was
developed for the discrimination of balanced and constant Boolean functions.
