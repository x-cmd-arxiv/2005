gravitational collapse in hierarchical structure formation scenarios and are
subject to further compression as baryons cool and settle to the halo centers.
We here describe an explicit implementation of the algorithm, originally
developed by Young, to calculate changes to the density profile as the result
of adiabatic infall in a spherical halo model. Halos with random motion are
more resistant to compression than are those in which random motions are
neglected, which is a key weakness of the simple method widely employed.
Young's algorithm results in density profiles in excellent agreement with those
from N-body simulations. We show how the algorithm may be applied to determine
the original uncompressed halos of real galaxies, a step which must be computed
with care in order to enable a confrontation with theoretical predictions from
theories such as LCDM.

may be related to the stellar masses of their host galaxies. Although the
submillimeter emission implies that these galaxies are undergoing an epoch of
intense star-formation, the Spitzer data reveal a massive stellar population
already in place. These stellar masses are then compared to previously
published black hole mass estimates derived from the X-ray luminosities under
the assumption of Eddington-limit accretion. We find that the black hole masses
for our high-redshift sample are approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller
than galaxies of comparable stellar mass in the local Universe. Although our
estimates of black hole masses will increase if the accretion is sub-Eddington,
and our stellar masses will decrease if we assume a much younger stellar
population or a different initial mass function, we find that only through a
combination of effects is it possible to shift the high redshift galaxies such
that they lie on the local relation. This suggests that the black holes need to
grow substantially between z=2.2 and the present-day, with much of the black
hole growth occurring after the current obscured, far-infrared luminous phase
of activity which is likely associated with the formation of the spheroid. This
interpretation supports a scenario where SMGs pass through a subsequent
accretion-dominated phase, where they would appear as optically bright quasars.

expected for a minimum mass solar nebula at 5.2 AU. Using hydrodynamic
simulations we find that when the configuration is such that convergent
migration occurs the planets can become locked in a first order
commensurability for which the period ratio is (p+1)/p with p being an integer
and migrate together maintaining it for many orbits. Relatively rapid
convergent migration as tends to occur for disparate masses, results in
commensurabilities with p larger than 2. However, in these cases the dynamics
is found to have a stochastic character. When the convergent migration is
slower, such as occurs in the equal mass case, lower p commensurabilities such
as 3:2 are attained which show much greater stability. In one already known
example of a system with nearly equal masses in the several Earth mass range
(planets around pulsar PSR B1257+12) the two largest planets are intriguingly
close to a 3:2 commensurability. A very similar behaviour is obtained when the
systems are modeled using an N body code with simple prescriptions for the disc
planet interaction. Using that, we found that an 8:7 resonance established in a
hydrodynamic simulation run for 10-100 thousand orbits could be maintained for
more than million orbits. Resonant capture leads to a rise in eccentricities
that can be predicted using a simple analytic model constructed in this paper.
We find that the system with the 8:7 commensurability is fully consistent with
this prediction.

photometric redshift information accurate to delta z <~0.5 and detailed SEDs
for the vast majority of the sub-mm-selected sources. In this paper, the first

Each smoothed particle is described by a handful of parameters including

appropriate complexity estimated from the data quality. This model is then
compared iteratively with X-ray data in the form of adaptively binned photon
lists via a two-sample likelihood statistic and iterated via Markov Chain Monte
Carlo. The complex cluster model is propagated through the X-ray instrument
response using direct sampling Monte Carlo methods. Using this approach the
method can reproduce many of the features observed in the X-ray emission in a
less assumption-dependent way that traditional analyses, and it allows for a
more detailed characterization of the density, temperature, and metal abundance

the PSF increases significantly in the near-IR and the aperture correction for
photometry with near-IR filters depends on the spectral energy distribution of
the source. We provide encircled energy curves and a detailed recipe to correct
for the latter effect.

known in our Galaxy. To examine the circumstellar matter distribution and to
better constraint the orbital parameters and mass-loss rate of the WR star, we
obtained broadband and multi-band (i.e. UBVRI) linear polarization observations
of the system. Our analysis of the phase-locked polarimetric modulation
confirms the high orbital inclination of the system (i.e. $i=65^o$). Using the
orbital solution of Lewis et al. (1993) we obtain masses of $33.9 M_{\odot}$
and $23.9 M_{\odot}$ for the O and WR stars respectively, which agree with
their spectral types. A simple polarimetric model accounting for finite stellar
size effects allowed us to derive a mass-loss rate for the WR star of
$0.3-0.5\times10^{-5} M_{\odot}/yr$. This result was remarkably independent of
the model's input parameters and favors an earlier spectral type for the WR
component (i.e. WN4). Finally, using our multi-band observations, we fitted and
subtracted from our data the interstellar polarization. The resulting constant
intrinsic polarization of $3-4%$ is misaligned in relation to the orbital plane
(i.e. $\theta_{CIP}=26^o$ vs. $\Omega=75^o$) and is the highest intrinsic
polarization ever observed for a WR star. This misalignment points towards a
rotational (or magnetic) origin for the asymmetry and contradicts the most
recent evolutionary models for massive stars (Meynet & Maeder 2003) which
predict spherically symmetric winds during the WR phase (i.e. $CIP=0%$).

(1) The cross-correlation function xi_{ga} measured using only emission-line

strength to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_{gg} on co-moving,
projection distance scales < 1 h^{-1} Mpc, while there remains a lack of

This signifies a morphology-dependent xi_{ga} and indicates that strong

supersonic jets, exploring the influence of jet Mach number and the ambient

results are compared to simple self-similar scaling relations for the
morphological evolution of jet-driven structures and to previously published 2D
simulations. For this study we simulated the propagation of light jets with
internal Mach numbers 3 and 12 to lengths exceeding 100 initial jet radii in
both uniform and stratified atmospheres.
  The propagating jets asymptotically deposit approximately half of their
energy flux as thermal energy in the ambient atmosphere, almost independent of
jet Mach number or the external density gradient. Nearly one-quarter of the jet
total energy flux goes directly into dissipative heating of the ICM, supporting
arguments for effective feedback from AGNs to cluster media. The remaining
energy resides primarily in the jet and cocoon structures. Despite having
different shock distributions and magnetic field features, global trends in
energy flow are similar among the different models.
  As expected the jets advance more rapidly through stratified atmospheres than
uniform environments. The asymptotic head velocity in King-type atmospheres
shows little or no deceleration. This contrasts with jets in uniform media with
heads that are slowed as they propagate. This suggests that the energy
deposited by jets of a given length and power depends strongly on the structure
of the ambient medium. While our low-Mach jets are more easily disrupted, their
cocoons obey evolutionary scaling relations similar to the high-Mach jets.

result, the locus of NLS1s on the M_BH--sigma plane is affected by selection

differ with redshift, consistent with the downsizing of AGN activity. If these

strong to be consistent with current laboratory measurements. But this does not
yet readily rule out the SiC hypothesis since recent experimental results have
demonstrated that the 21mu resonance of doped SiC becomes stronger as the C

bubbles from previous episodes of radio activity. We find a spur of

a generally undetected second neutron star (NS), have proven to be excellent
laboratories for testing the theory of general relativity. The seven systems
discovered in our Galaxy exhibit a remarkably well-defined relation between the
pulsar spin period and the orbital eccentricity. Here we show, using a simple
model where the pulsar is spun up by mass transfer from a helium-star
companion, that this relation can only be produced if the second neutron star
received a kick that is substantially smaller (with a velocity dispersion of
less than 50 km/s) than the standard kick received by a single radio pulsar.
This demonstrates that the kick mechanism depends on the evolutionary history
of the NS progenitor and that the orbital parameters of DNSs are completely
determined by the evolution in the preceding helium star - neutron star phase.
This has important implications for estimating the rates of NS-NS mergers, one
of the major potential astrophysical sources for the direct detection of
gravitational waves, and for short-period gamma-ray bursts.

light curves we find the radii of the stars to be 1.927 +/- 0.011 Rsun and
1.841 +/- 0.011 Rsun, where the uncertainties have been calculated using a
Monte Carlo algorithm. Fundamental effective temperatures of the two stars have
been derived, using the Hipparcos parallax of WW Aur and published ultraviolet,
optical and infrared fluxes, and are 7960 +/- 420 and 7670 +/- 410 K. The
masses, radii and effective temperatures of WW Aur are only matched by
theoretical evolutionary models for a fractional initial metal abundance, Z, of
approximately 0.06 and an age of roughly 90 Myr. This seems to be the highest
metal abundance inferred for a well-studied detached eclipsing binary, but we
find no evidence that it is related to the metallic-lined nature of the stars.
The circular orbit of WW Aur is in conflict with the circularization timescales
of both the Tassoul and the Zahn tidal theories and we suggest that this is due
to pre-main-sequence evolution or the presence of a circular orbit when the

numerical simulations of driven turbulence in supercritical, ideal-MHD, and
non-magnetic regimes, characterized by their mean normalized mass-to-flux ratio
$\mu$, all with 64 Jeans masses and similar rms Mach numbers ($\sim 10$). In
most cases, the moderately supercritical runs with $\mu = 2.8$ have
significantly lower SFEs than the non-magnetic cases, being comparable to
observational estimates for whole molecular clouds ($\lesssim$ 5% over 4 Myr).
Also, as the mean field is increased, the number of collapsed objects
decreases, and the median mass of the collapsed objects increases. However, the
largest collapsed-object masses systematically occur in the weak-field case
$\mu = 8.8$. The high-density tails of the density histograms in the
simulations are depressed as the mean magnetic field strength is increased.
This suggests that the smaller numbers and larger masses of the collapsed
objects in the magnetic cases may be due to a greater scarcity and lower mean
densities (implying larger Jeans masses) of the collapse candidates. In this
scenario, the effect of a weak field is to reduce the probability of a core
reaching its thermal Jeans mass, even if it is supercritical. We thus suggest
that the SFE may be monotonically reduced as the field strength increases from
zero to subcritical values, rather than there being a discontinuous transition
between the sub- and supercritical regimes, and that a crucial question to
address is whether the turbulence in molecular clouds is driven or decaying,
with current observational and theoretical evidence favoring (albeit

has a strong effect on dynamic properties of single actin filaments. At high
concentrations of free actin monomers the mean size of unhydrolyzed ATP-cap is
very large, and the dynamics is governed by association/dissociation of
ATP-actin subunits. However, at low concentrations the size of the cap becomes
finite, and the dissociation of ADP-actin subunits makes a significant
contribution to overall dynamics. Actin filament length fluctuations reach the
maximum at the boundary between two dynamic regimes, and this boundary is
always larger than the critical concentration. Random and vectorial mechanisms

electronic structure of the Aurivillius phase ferroelectric SrBi$_2$Ta$_2$O$_9$
(SBT), which displays a ferroelectric distortion below 608 K associated with
the tendency of lone pair active Bi$^{3+}$ to move off-center. Such coherent
off-centering distortions are frustrated on the pyrochlore lattice, and this
prevents a ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.
Instead, Bi$^{3+}$ ions in Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ are obliged to off-center in an
\textit{incoherent} manner, that is compatible with the cubic structure being
retained. Frustrated lone pair behavior in the defect pyrochlore
Pb$_2$Sn$_2$O$_6$ is also described. Parallels between the well-studied
frustration of certain types of \textit{magnetism} in pyrochlore compounds
(spin-ice) and the striking paucity of ferroelectric pyrochlores, arising from
the corner-connected tetrahedral topology of the pyrochlore lattice are pointed
out.

local surface derelaxation, while it leaves the phenyl group almost
unperturbed. The investigation of the functionalized surface as a function of
the coverage (e.g. 0.5 -- 1 ML) and of the substrate reconstruction reveals two
major effects. The first results from Si dimer-vinyl interaction and concerns
the controlled variation of the energy bandgap of the interface. The second is
associated to phenyl-phenyl interactions, which gives rise to a regular pattern
of electronic wires at surface, stemming from the pi-pi coupling. These
findings suggest a rationale for tailoring the surface nano-patterning of the

themselves in the properties of the particle-particle vertex, which we
calculate in a ladder approximation. To find the critical temperatures

the same vertex. This approximate treatment is shown to be quite satisfactory
in a number of limiting situations where it agrees with known exact results.
The results for the BCS critical temperature and for the BE condensation are
found to be in fair agreement with earlier results. The threshold for formation
of molecules at rest undergoes a sizeable shift toward the BEC side, due to
quantum effects arising from the presence of the degenerate Fermi gas. This
should make its experimental observation fairly easy. This shift remains
important at least up to temperatures comparable to the Fermi energy of the

damps the resonator and renormalizes its frequency. Depending on the gate and

the SSET can also give rise to an instability in the mechanical resonator

gravitational-wave detector. Since the cross-correlated signal is obtained
through an all-sky integral of primary signals convolving with the antenna
pattern function of gravitational-wave detectors, the non-stationarity of
cross-correlated signals, together with full knowledge of antenna pattern
functions, can be used to reconstruct an intensity map of the GWBs. Here, we
give two simple methods to reconstruct a skymap of GWBs based on the
perturbative expansion in low-frequency regime. The first one is based on
harmonic-Fourier representation of data streams and the second is based on

$K\pi$ system from decays of $D^{+}$ mesons to the three-body $\Km\pip\pip$
final state is described. Data come from the Fermilab E791 experiment.
Amplitude measurements are made independently for ranges of $\Km\pip$ invariant
mass, and results are obtained below 825 \MeVcc, where previous measurements
exist only in two mass bins.
  This method of parametrizing a three-body decay amplitude represents a new
approach to analysing such decays. Though no model is required for the \swave,
a parametrization of the relatively well-known reference \pdash and \dwave s,
optimized to describe the data used, is required. In this paper, a Breit-Wigner
model is adopted to describe the resonances in these waves.
  The observed phase variation for the \sdash, \pdash and \dwave s do not match
existing measurements of $I=\half$ $\Km\pip$ scattering in the invariant mass
range in which scattering is predominantly elastic.
  If the data are mostly $I=\half$, this observation indicates that the Watson
theorem, which requires these phases to have the same dependence on invariant
mass, may not apply to these decays without allowing for some interaction with
the other pion.
  The production rate of $\Km\pip$ from these decays, if assumed to be
predominantly $I=\half$, is also found to have a significant dependence on
invariant mass in the region above 1.25 \GeVcc.
  These measurements can provide a relatively model-free basis for future
attempts to determine which strange scalar amplitudes contribute to the decays.

oscillations (which suggest the existence of right-handed neutrinos with

unification based on the symmetry SU(4)-color. This in turn selects out the
effective symmetry in 4D near the GUT/string scale to be either SO(10) or
minimally G(224)= SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \times SU(4)^c. The same conclusion is
reached by the likely need for leptogenesis as the means for baryogenesis and
also by the success of certain fermion mass-relations including
m_b(M_{GUT})\approx m_\tau, together with m(\nu^\tau)_{Dirac}\approx
m_{top}(M_{GUT}). In the second part, an attempt is made to provide a unified
picture of a set of diverse phenomena based on an effective G(224) symmetry or
SO(10), possessing supersymmetry. The phenomena in question include: (a)
fermion masses and mixings, (b) neutrino oscillations, (c) CP non-conservation,
(d) flavor violations in quark and lepton sectors, as well as (e) baryogenesis
via leptogenesis. Including SM and SUSY contributions, the latter being
sub-dominant, the framework correctly accounts for \Delta m_K, \Delta m_{B_d},
  S(B_d -> J/\psi K_s) and \epsilon_K, and predicts S(B_d-> \phi K_s) to be in
the range +(0.65-0.73), close to the SM-prediction. It also quite plausibly
accounts for the observed baryon excess Y_B\approx 10^{-10}. Furthermore the

related lagrangian descriptions. This provides a Chevalley-Serre presentation
of the affine Kac Moody algebra which follows a universal pattern for all
supergravities and is an extension of the mechanism considered by Nicolai for
pure N=1 supergravity. There are new distinctive features in extended theories
related to the presence of vector fields and to their symplectic description.
The novelty is that in supergravity the so named Matzner-Missner description is
structurally different from the Ehlers one with gauge 0--forms subject to
SO(2n,2n) electric--magnetic duality rotations representing in D=2 the Sp(2n,R)
rotations of D=4. The role played by the symplectic bundle of vectors is
emphasized in view of implementing the affine extension also in N=2

the Tits Satake projection of the duality algebras. This is very important for
the issue of cosmic billiards. We also comment on the general field theoretical

the case of non-minimal coupling the effective lagrangian contains an

case of minimal coupling there is no parity violation and the effective
lagrangian contains only the usual axial-axial interaction. In this situation
the real values of the Immirzi parameter are not at all constrained. On the

method is extended to non maximal supergravities. A new key feature is the
non-maximal split nature of the scalar coset manifold. To deal with this, one
needs the theory of Tits Satake projections leading to maximal split projected
algebras. Interesting exact solutions that display several smooth bounces can
thus be derived. From the analysis of the Tits Satake projection emerges a
regular scheme for all non maximal supergravities and a challenging so far
unobserved structure, that of the paint group G-paint. This latter is preserved
through dimensional reduction and provides a powerful tool to codify solutions.
It appears that the dynamical walls on which the cosmic ball bounces come
actually in painted copies rotated into each other by G-paint. The effective
cosmic dynamics is that dictated by the maximal split Tits Satake manifold plus
paint. We work out in details the example provided by N=6,D=4 supergravity,
whose scalar manifold is the special Kahlerian SO*(12)}/SU(6)xU(1). In D=3 it
maps to the quaternionic E_7(-5)/ SO(12) x SO(3). From this example we extract
a scheme that holds for all supergravities with homogeneous scalar manifolds
and that we plan to generalize to generic special geometries. We also comment
on the merging of the Tits-Satake projection with the affine Kac--Moody
extensions originating in dimensional reduction to D=2 and D=1.

timing of reheating, and the reheating temperature. Production of gravitons is
significantly suppressed in warped inflation. However, we predict a residual
gravitational radiation background at the level $\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-8}$ of
the present cosmological energy density. We also extend our analysis to
multiple throat scenarios. A viable reheating would be possible in a single
throat or in a certain subclass of multiple throat scenarios of the KKLMMT type
inflation model, but overproduction of massive KK modes poses a serious
problem. The problem is quite severe if some inner manifold comes with
approximate isometries (angular KK modes) or if there exists a throat of modest
length other than the standard model throat, possibly associated with some
hidden sector (low-lying KK modes).

the positivity of the energy in the charged sectors.
  The main observation of this paper is that the positivity of the energy -- at
least in case of a Chiral Conformal QFT -- is a local concept: it is related to
the fact that the energy density, when smeared with some local nonnegative test
functions, remains bounded from below (with the bound depending on the test

  The presented proof relies in an essential way on recently developed methods

value problem can be computed as the relative index between the Calderon
projector on the boundary and the projector defining the boundary condition. To
make sense of this statement we need to develop a considerable extension of the
classical notion of a Fredholm pair of subspaces of a Hilbert space. We call
this the theory of ""tame Fredholm pairs;"" it is presented in the appendix to
the paper. Using these tools, we give a proof of a conjecture of Atiyah and
Weinstein for the index of a Fourier integral operator defined by a contact
transformation between the boundaries of two strictly pseudoconvex manifolds.

between two generalized Szego projectors as the index of a Dirac operator on a
compact ""glued"" space with correction terms coming from boundary value
problems. The Atiyah-Weinstein conjecture is a simple special case of this
general formula. Special cases of this result were earlier proved by Epstein
and Melrose, and Leichtnam, Nest and Tsygan. Using our general formula for

metrics. The solutions are parameterized by the moduli information, and the
metrics may be found to any desired accuracy in derivatives. Metric information
to low orders in derivatives allows for a counting of curves inside the
manifold; in addition, the coefficients of these exponential terms via D-brane
wrappings are polynomials that may admit an invariant interpretation in
cohomology. An interesting case pertaining to M-theory compactifications is the
collection of seven-dimensional $G_2$ manifolds; they can also be obtained when
the moduli space degenerates into cases, such as a toroidal one or other limit
in which modular functions on the space are known. Note: this work was written
two years ago; the recipe without the explicit form of the scattering and
metrics is given.

waveguide bounded by a periodically rippled surface, in the presence of the
time-periodic electric field. It was found that in a deep semiclassical region
the diffusion-like motion occurs for a particle in the region corresponding to
a stochastic layer surrounding the coupling resonance. The rate of the quantum
diffusion turns out to be less than the corresponding classical one, thus
indicating the influence of quantum coherent effects. Another result is that
even in the case when such a diffusion is possible, it terminates in time due
to the mechanism similar to that of the dynamical localization. The quantum
Arnol'd diffusion represents a new type of quantum dynamics, and may be
experimentally observed in measurements of a conductivity of low-dimensional

is easily treated by cascaded systems theory if the intervening quantum channel
is dispersionless. However, dispersion may be important in some transfer
protocols, especially in solid-state systems. In this paper we show how to
generalize cascaded systems theory to treat such dispersion, provided it is not
too strong. We show that the technique also works for fermionic systems with a
low flux, and can be extended to treat fermionic systems with large flux. To
test our theory, we calculate the effect of dispersion on the fidelity of a
simple protocol of quantum state transfer. We find good agreement with an
approximate analytical theory that had been previously developed for this
example.
