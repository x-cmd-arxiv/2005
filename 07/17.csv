negative K-correction in the millimeter domain. Many dusty star-forming
galaxies, invisible in the optical or NIR, will be detected easily through the
peak of their emission in the FIR redshifted in the submm between z=10 and z=5.
Their mass and dynamics will be determined through the CO lines, together with
the efficiency of star formation. Normal intervening galaxies at all z will be
studied through absorption lines in front of quasars, exploring the dense tail
of the column density spectrum. CMB anisotropies could be detected at the
arcsecond scale, the secondary effects (SZ, Vishniak-Ostriker) could test the
re-ionization and the nature of dark energy. The detection of the SZ effect on
a few arcsec scales will allow to map in detail clusters and proto-clusters.

considered in the force-free limit, where the inertia of the conducting matter
which enforces the MHD condition E.B = 0 can be neglected in comparison with
the inertia of the electromagnetic field. By extending the analysis beyond the
WKB approximation, we are able to study the non-linearities induced by a
gravitational field. We treat the perturbed electromagnetic field as a fluid of
infinite conductivity. We calculate the scattering of a torsional (Alfven) wave
by a gravitational potential, and demonstrate a nonlinear coupling with a
compressive (fast) wave which is second order in the amplitude of the Alfven
wave. In a cylindrically symmetric spacetime with slow rotation, the coupling
is second order in g_{t\phi} and first order in the amplitude of the wave. We
also give a fresh analysis of the non-linear interactions between compressive
and torsional waves in Minkowski space, with a focus on the relative strengths
of their three- and four-mode interactions. In contrast with non-relativistic
magnetofluids, the effects of compression are always present. In the case of
colliding fast waves, a net displacement of the field lines across (at least)
one of the colliding wavepackets is shown to have a strong effect on the
outgoing waveform, and to have a qualitatively different interpretation than
was previously suggested for colliding Alfven waves. Finally, we show how
spacetime curvature modifies the collision between two torsional waves, in both
the weak- and strong-field regimes.

of many independent servers with identical capabilities. Customers of $I\ge2$
classes can be served at these stations at different rates, that depend on both
the class and the station. A system administrator dynamically controls
scheduling and routing. We study this model in the central limit theorem (or
heavy traffic) regime proposed by Halfin and Whitt. We derive a diffusion model
on $\mathbb {R}^I$ with a singular control term that describes the scaling
limit of the queueing model. The singular term may be used to constrain the
diffusion to lie in certain subsets of $\mathbb {R}^I$ at all times $t>0$. We
say that the diffusion is null-controllable if it can be constrained to
$\mathbb {X}_-$, the minimal closed subset of $\mathbb {R}^I$ containing all
states of the prelimit queueing model for which all queues are empty. We give
sufficient conditions for null controllability of the diffusion. Under these
conditions we also show that an analogous, asymptotic result holds for the
queueing model, by constructing control policies under which, for any given
$0<\epsilon <T<\infty$, all queues in the system are kept empty on the time
interval $[\epsilon, T]$, with probability approaching one. This introduces a
new, unusual heavy traffic ``behavior'': On one hand, the system is critically
loaded, in the sense that an increase in any of the external arrival rates at
the ``fluid level'' results with an overloaded system. On the other hand, as
far as queue lengths are concerned, the system behaves as if it is underloaded.

  suggestions. It will be published in Ann. Inst. H. Poincare",,,,"math.PR math.CO",,"  We find limit shapes for a family of multiplicative measures on the set of
partitions, induced by exponential generating functions with expansive
parameters, $a_k\sim Ck^{p-1}, k\to\infty, p>0$,where $C$ is a positive
constant. The measures considered are associated with reversible
coagulation-fragmentation processes and certain combinatorial structures, known
as assemblies. We prove the functional central limit theorem for the
fluctuations of a scaled random partition from its limit shape. We demonstrate
that when the component size passes beyond the threshold value, the
independence of numbers of components transforms into their conditional
independence. Among other things, the paper also discusses, in a general
setting, the interplay between limit shapes, threshold and gelation.

"math/0507344","Anne Heyworth","A. Heyworth, M. Johnson","Logged Rewriting for Monoids","20 pages",,,,"math.CO math.CT",,"  A rewriting system is a set of equations over a given set of terms called
rules that characterize a system of computation and is a powerful general
method for providing decision procedures of equational theories, based upon the
principle of replacing subterms of an expression with other terms.
  In particular, a string rewriting system is usually associated with a monoid
presentation. At the first level the problem is to decide which combinations of
the generators are equivalent under the given rules; Knuth-Bendix completion of
the string rewriting system is one of the most successful mechanisms for
solving this problem. At the second level, the problem involves determining
which combinations of rules are equivalent.
  Logged rewriting is a technique which not only transforms strings but records
the transformation in terms of the original system of rules. The relations
between combinatorial, homotopical and homological finiteness conditions for
monoids prompt us to consider using computer-friendly rewriting systems to
calculate homotopical and homological structure from monoid presentations.

lower than the threshold of the $\Delta\Delta$ channel but higher than that of
