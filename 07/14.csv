physics beyond the standard model are WIMPs and weak scale gravitinos. If the
lightest stable particle is a gravitino, then a WIMP will decay into it with a
natural lifetime of order a month ~ M_{pl}^2/M_{weak}^3. We show that if the
bulk of dark matter today came from decays of neutral particles with lifetimes
of order a year or smaller, then it could lead to a reduction in the amount of
small scale substructure, less concentrated halos and constant density cores in
the smallest mass halos. Such beneficial effects may therefore be realized
naturally, as discussed by Cembranos, Feng, Rajaraman, and Takayama, in the
case of supersymmetry.

However, the observed lensing signal corresponds to a weighted average of the

baryon oscillations has been somewhat neglected. These features originated
prior to recombination, induced by the acoustics of the photon-baryon fluid.
Recent galaxy surveys have detected the imprints, and in the future such
measurements may even be used to refine our understanding of dark energy.
Without redshift information, cosmic shear is an ineffective probe of the
baryon oscillations. However, by implementing a novel multipole-dependent
selection of photometric redshift bins, sensitivity is improved by an order of
magnitude, bringing the ""wiggles"" within reach of future surveys. As an

Nonrelativistic potential-based equations of state with hyperons are not
constrained by the redshift, primarily due to a smaller stellar radius.

attributed to fluorescence by small, 3-4 ringed neutral polycyclic aromatic

where such small molecules are actively being produced and shielded from the
harsh interstellar radiation by a dense circumstellar disk. In this paper we
present the BL spectrum detected in several ordinary reflection nebulae

aromatic emission features (AEFs) attributed to large PAHs. We present the

make a constraint on the theoretical models of magnetic reconnection. In order
to reduce the uncertainty of the reconnection rate, it is important to
determine the energy release rate of the flares from observational data as
accurately as possible. To this end, we have carried out one dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of a flare loop and synthesized the count rate
detected by the soft X-ray telescope (SXT) aboard Yohkoh satellite. We found
that the time derivative of the thermal energy contents in a flare arcade
derived from SXT data is smaller than the real energy release rate by a factor
of 0.3 - 0.8, depending on the loop length and the energy release rate. The
result of simulation is presented in the paper and used to calculate the

the embarrassment of lacking a relativistic version. One primary success of
TeVeS is that it provides an enhancement of gravitational lensing, which could
not be achieved by other MONDian theories. Following Bekenstein's work, we
investigate the phenomena of gravitational lensing including deflection angles,
lens equations and time delay. We find that the deflection angle would maintain
its value while the distance of closest approach vary in the MOND regime, this
coincides with the conclusion of Mortlock and Turner's (2001) intuitional
approach. Moreover, the scalar field, which is introduced to enhance the
deflection angle in TeVeS, contributes a negative effect on the potential time
delay. Unfortunately this phenomenon is unmeasurable in lensing systems where
we can only observe the time delay between two images for a given source.
However, this measurable time delay offers another constraint on the mass ratio
of the DM and MOND scenarios, which in general differs from that given by the
deflection angle. In other words, for a lensing system, if two masses, m_gN and
m_gM, are mutually alternatives for the deflection angles in their own
paradigm, regarding the time delay they are in general in an exclusive
relation.

beam of non-thermal electrons injected at the apex of a one-dimensional closed
coronal loop, and include heating from thermal soft X-ray, extreme ultraviolet
and ultraviolet (XEUV) emission. The equations of radiative transfer and
statistical equilibrium were treated in non-LTE and solved for numerous
transitions of hydrogen, helium, and Ca II allowing the calculation of detailed
line profiles and continuum emission. This work improves upon previous
simulations by incorporating more realistic non-thermal electron beam models
and includes a more rigorous model of thermal XEUV heating. We find XEUV
backwarming contributes less than 10% of the heating, even in strong flares.
The simulations show elevated coronal and transition region densities resulting
in dramatic increases in line and continuum emission in both the UV and optical
regions. The optical continuum reaches a peak increase of several percent which
is consistent with enhancements observed in solar white light flares. For a
moderate flare (~M-class), the dynamics are characterized by a long gentle
phase of near balance between flare heating and radiative cooling, followed by
an explosive phase with beam heating dominating over cooling and characterized
by strong hydrodynamic waves. For a strong flare (~X-class), the gentle phase
is much shorter, and we speculate that for even stronger flares the gentle
phase may be essentially non-existent. During the explosive phase, synthetic
profiles for lines formed in the upper chromosphere and transition region show
blue shifts corresponding to a plasma velocity of ~120 km/s, and lines formed

vectorized such parts by changing the loop structure, so that the innermost

strong Balmer and He emission lines, short-period (~10-20min) flickering and
weak X-ray emission in the ROSAT All Sky Survey. The detection of a deep low

  Our models predict the production of fast rotating black holes. Models with
large initial masses or high metallicity end their life with less angular

formation, loss of hydrogen-rich envelope and enough angular momentum to form
an accretion disk around the black hole) for gamma-ray bursts (GRB) production
via the collapsar model (Woosley 1993). Considering all types of WR stars as
GRB progenitors, there would be too many GRBs compared to observations. If we
consider only WO stars (type Ic supernovae as is the case for
SN2003dh/GRB030329, see Matheson et al. 2003) as GRBs progenitors, the GRBs
production rates are in much better agreement with observations. WO stars are

population models that include the thermally pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch

declines exponentially as a function of time, the e-folding time being longer
than 3 Gyr. In addition, we use calculations of radiative transfer of the

order to explore the wide parameter space of dust attenuation. We find that
synthetic disks can exhibit red optical/near-infrared colours because of
reddening by dust, but only if they have been forming stars for at least about
1 Gyr. Extremely few models barely exhibit Rc-K>5.3, if the inclination i=90
deg and if the opacity 2*tauV>6. Hence, Rc-K-selected galaxies at 1<z<2 most
probably are either systems with an old, passively evolving bulge or
starbursts. Synthetic disks at 1<z<2 exhibit 4<Ic-K<4.8, if they are seen edge
on (i.e. at i about 90 deg) and if 2*tauV>0.5. This explains the large fraction
of observed, edge-on disk-like galaxies with Ks<19.5 and F814W-Ks>4. Finally,
models with 2<z<3.2 exhibit 2.3<J-K<3, with no bias towards i about 90 deg and
for a large range in opacity (e.g. 2*tauV>1 for i about 70 deg). In conclusion,
red disk-like galaxies at 0.8<z<3.2 may not necessarily be dustier than nearby
disk galaxies (with 0.5<2*tauV<2) and/or much older than about 1 Gyr. This
result is due both to a realistic description of dust attenuation and to the

state for six ``mixed-morphology'' supernova emnants (MMSNRs): IC 443, W49B,
W28, W44, 3C391, and Kes 27. MMSNRs show centrally filled thermal X-ray
emission, which contrasts to shell-like radio morphology, a set of
haracteristics at odds with the standard model of SNR evolution (e.g., the
Sedov model). We have therefore studied the evolution of the MMSNRs from the
ionization conditions inferred from the X-ray spectra, independent of X-ray
morphology. We find highly ionized plasmas approaching ionization equilibrium
in all the mmsnrs. The degree of ionization is systematically higher than the
plasma usually seen in shell-like SNRs. Radial temperature gradients are also
observed in five remnants, with cooler plasma toward the limb. In IC 443 and
W49B, we find a plasma structure consistent with shell-like SNRs, suggesting
that at least some MMSNRs have experienced similar evolution to shell-like
SNRs. In addition to the results above, we have discovered an ``overionized''
ionization state in W49B, in addition to that previously found in IC 443.
Thermal conduction can cause the hot interior plasma to become overionized by
reducing the temperature and density gradients, leading to an interior density
increase and temperature decrease. Therefore, we suggest that the
``center-filled'' X-ray morphology develops as the result of thermal
conduction, and should arise in all SNRs. This is consistent with the results
that MMSNRs are near collisional ionization equilibrium since the conduction
timescale is roughly similar to the ionization timescale. Hence, we conclude
that MMSNRs are those that have evolved over$\sim10^4$ yr. We call this phase
as the ``conduction phase.''

the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized

widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (De
Bruyn and Brentjens, 2005). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as
good as traditional linear fits to polarization angle versus lambda squared
plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized

of the emission across the full field of view and detect polarized emission

associated with our Galaxy, while the high RM emission is associated with the

polarized emission appears too bright, by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, to be
explainable as Thomson scattered emission of the central radio source off the

Perseus cluster is probably related to buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma,
probably relics from still active or now dormant AGN within the cluster. A
lenticular shaped structure measuring 0.5-1 Mpc is strikingly similar to the

interference device (NQUID) is presented. The device consists of a pair of
thin-film superconducting leads connected by a pair of topologically parallel
ultra-narrow superconducting wires. It exhibits intrinsic electrical
resistance, due to thermally-activated dissipative fluctuations of the
superconducting order parameter. Attention is given to the dependence of this
resistance on the strength of an externally applied magnetic field aligned
perpendicular to the leads, for lead dimensions such that there is essentially
complete and uniform penetration of the leads by the magnetic field. This
regime, in which at least one of the lead dimensions lies between the
superconducting coherence and penetration lengths, is referred to as the
mesoscopic regime. The magnetic field causes a pronounced oscillation of the
device resistance, with a period not dominated by the Aharonov-Bohm effect
through the area enclosed by the wires and the film edges but, rather, in terms
of the geometry of the leads, in contrast to the well-known Little-Parks
resistance of thin-walled superconducting cylinders. A theory, encompassing
this phenomenology, is developed through extensions, to the setting of parallel
superconducting wires, of the Ivanchenko-Zil'berman-Ambegaokar-Halperin theory
for the case of short wires and the Langer-Ambegaokar-McCumber-Halperin theory
for the case of longer wires. It is demonstrated that the NQUID acts as a probe

recent generalization of algebraic data types. We reduce type inference for
GRDTs to unification under a mixed prefix. Thus, we obtain efficient type
inference. Inference is incomplete because the set of type constraints allowed
to appear in the type system is only a subset of those type constraints
generated by type inference. Hence, inference only succeeds if the program is
sufficiently type annotated. We present refined procedures to infer types
incrementally and to assist the user in identifying which pieces of type
information are missing. Additionally, we introduce procedures to test if a
type is not principal and to find a principal type if one exists.

argue that the ``surface area'' coordinate condition determining the ``radial''
coordinate can be considered as part of the initial data and should be chosen
in a way that gives information about the physical problem whose solution is
sought. For the two-body problem, we choose this coordinate by imposing a
condition that allows it to be interpreted, near infinity, as the (inverse of
the) Newtonian potential. In this way, two quantities that specify the problem
-- the separation of the two particles and their mass ratio -- enter the
equations from the very beginning. The asymptotic solution (near infinity) is
obtained and a natural identification of the Bondi ""news function"" in terms of
the source parameters is suggested, leading to an expression for the radiated
energy that differs from the standard quadrupole formula but agrees with recent
non-linear calculations. When the free function of time describing the
separation of the two particles is chosen so as to make the new expression
agree with the classical result, closed-form analytic expressions are obtained,
the resulting metric approaching the Schwarzschild solution with time. As all
physical quantities are defined with respect to the flat metric at infinity,
the physical interpretation of this solution depends strongly on how these
definitions are extended to the near-zone and, in particular, how the ""time""
function in the near-zone is related to Bondi's null coordinate.

contact to the spinning string energies we then study the thermodynamic limit
of the one-loop gauge theory Bethe equations and demonstrate the matching with
the folded and closed string result at this loop order. Finally the known gauge
theory results at higher-loop orders are reviewed and the associated long-range

moduli space of Riemann surfaces whose $n$ boundaries are ''rigged'' with
analytic parametrizations. The fundamental operation is the sewing of such
surfaces using the parametrizations to identify points. An alternative model is
the moduli space of $n$-punctured Riemann surfaces together with local
biholomorphic coordinates at the punctures. We refer to both of these moduli
spaces as the ""rigged Riemann moduli space"".
  By generalizing to quasisymmetric boundary parametrizations, and defining
rigged Teichmueller spaces in both the border and puncture pictures, we prove
the following results: (1) The Teichmueller space of a genus-$g$ surface
bordered by $n$ closed curves covers the rigged Riemann and rigged Teichmueller
moduli spaces of surfaces of the same type, and induces complex manifold
structures on them. (2) With this complex structure the sewing operation is
holomorphic. (3) The border and puncture pictures of the rigged moduli and
rigged Teichmueller spaces are biholomorphically equivalent.
  These results are necessary in rigorously defining CFT (in the sense of G.
Segal), as well as for the construction of CFT from vertex operator algebras.

excessive to the extent of being unrealistic from practical point of view. The
two facts which the mentioned theorem gets wrong from practical point of view

methods for linear PDEs, - the effect of the propagation of round-off errors in
such numerical methods. The mentioned theorem leads to a result for PDEs which
is unrealistically better than the well known best possible similar result in

potential $V$. The spectrum of this operator is absolutely continuous and
consists of intervals separated by gaps. We define a Lyapunov function which is
analytic on a two sheeted Riemann surface. On each sheet, the Lyapunov function
has the same properties as in the scalar case, but it has branch points, which
we call resonances. We prove the existence of real as well as non-real
resonances for specific potentials. We determine the asymptotics of the
periodic and anti-periodic spectrum and of the resonances at high energy. We
show that there exist two type of gaps: 1) stable gaps, where the endpoints are
periodic and anti-periodic eigenvalues, 2) unstable (resonance) gaps, where the
endpoints are resonances (i.e., real branch points of the Lyapunov function
above the bottom of the spectrum). We also show that the periodic and
anti-periodic spectrum together determine the spectrum of our operator.
Finally, we show that for small potentials $V\ne 0$ the spectrum in the lowest
band has multiplicity 4 and the bottom of the spectrum is a resonance, and not
a periodic (or anti-periodic) eigenvalue.

We have performed a comprehensive study of multiplicity distributions in the
full ideal hadron-resonance gas in different ensembles, namely grand-canonical,
canonical and microcanonical, using two different methods: asymptotic
expansions and full Monte Carlo simulations. The method based on asymptotic
expansion allows a quick numerical calculation of dispersions in the hadron gas
with three conserved charges at primary hadron level, while the Monte-Carlo
simulation is suitable to study the effect of resonance decays. Even though
mean multiplicities converge to the same values, major differences in
fluctuations for these ensembles persist in the thermodynamic limit, as pointed
out in recent studies. We observe that this difference is ultimately related to
the non-additivity of the variances in the ensembles with exact conservation of

short, self-accelerating phase is followed by a prolonged phase of slow
deceleration. In biological terms, this regime of evolution can be tentatively

  model based on mutual inhibition of frontness and backness pathways","20 pages, 11 figures",,,,"q-bio.CB",,"  A key problem of eukaryotic cell motility is the signaling mechanism of
chemoattractant gradient sensing. Recent experiments have revealed the
molecular correlate of gradient sensing: Frontness molecules, such as PI3P and
Rac, localize at the front end of the cell, and backness molecules, such as Rho
and myosin II, accumulate at the back of the cell. Importantly, this
frontness-backness polarization occurs ""spontaneously"" even if the cells are
exposed to uniform chemoattractant profiles. The spontaneous polarization
suggests that the gradient sensing machinery undergoes a Turing bifurcation.
This has led to several classical activator-inhibitor and activator-substrate
models which identify the frontness molecules with the activator. Conspicuously
absent from these models is any accounting of the backness molecules. This
stands in sharp contrast to experiments which show that the backness pathways
inhibit the frontness pathways. Here, we formulate a model based on the
mutually inhibitory interaction between the frontness and backness pathways.
The model builds upon the mutual inhibition model proposed by Bourne and
coworkers (Xu et al, Cell, 114, 201--214, 2003). We show that mutual inhibition
alone, without the help of any positive feedback, can trigger spontaneous
polarization of the frontness and backness pathways. The spatial distribution
of the frontness and backness molecules in response to inhbition and activation
of the frontness and backness pathways are consistent with those observed in
experiments. Furthermore, depending on the parameter values, the model yields
spatial distributions corresponding to chemoattraction (frontness pathways
in-phase with the external gradient) and chemorepulsion (frontness pathways
out-of-phase with the external gradient).

a biologically important example of the translocation of a macromolecular chain
along its length through a membrane. The simplest mechanism for this motion is
diffusion, but in the case of phage ejection a significant driving force
derives from the high degree of stress to which the DNA is subjected in the
viral capsid. The translocation is further sped up by the ratcheting and
entropic forces associated with proteins that bind to the viral DNA in the host
cell cytoplasm. We formulate a generalized diffusion equation that includes
these various pushing and pulling effects and make estimates of the
corresponding speed-ups in the overall translocation process. Stress in the
capsid is the dominant factor throughout early ejection, with the pull due to

to this interpretation, QL formalizes properties of the metalinguistic concept

us to show that relative entropy distance from a convex set including maximally

from constructions of intrinsic information and entanglement of formation. We

for decoherence in the generation of photon pairs from atomic ensembles, via
the protocol of Duan et. al for long distance quantum communication [Nature
(London) 414, 413 (2001)] and present the experimental techniques necessary to
properly control the process. We develop a theory to model in detail the
decoherence process in experiments with magneto-optical traps. The
inhomogeneous broadening of the ground state by the trap magnetic field is
identified as the principal mechanism for decoherence. In conjunction with our
theoretical analysis, we report a series of measurements to characterize and
control the coherence time in our experimental setup. We use copropagating
stimulated Raman spectroscopy to access directly the ground state energy
distribution of the ensemble. These spectroscopic measurements allow us to
switch off the trap magnetic field in a controlled way, optimizing the
repetition rate for single-photon measurements. With the magnetic field off, we
then measure nonclassical correlations for pairs of photons generated by the
ensemble as a function of the storage time of the single collective atomic
excitation. We report coherence times longer than 10 microseconds,
corresponding to an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to previous
results in cold ensembles. The coherence time is now two orders of magnitude
longer than the duration of the excitation pulses. The comparison between these
experimental results and the theory shows good agreement. Finally, we employ
our theory to devise ways to improve the experiment by optical pumping to
specific initial states.
