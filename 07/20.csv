attention to the effect of magnetic fields with axisymmetric two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamical simulations. The evolution of magnetic SNRs is the same
as non-magnetic ones in the adiabatic Sedov stage. After a thin shell is
formed, the shell is driven by the pressure of the hot interior gas (bubble).
Evolution in the pressure-driven snow-plow phase is much affected by the
magnetic field. The shell sweeping the magnetic field lines thickens owing to
the magnetic pressure force. After $5\times 10^5{\rm yr}$ - $2\times 10^6{\rm
yr}$, the inner boundary of the thick shell begins to contract. This compresses
the hot bubble radially and maintains its thermal pressure. Thus, the bubble
forms a prolate spheroidal shape and becomes thinner and thinner, since it
expands in a direction parallel to the magnetic field for $B_0 \gtrsim 3\mu
{\rm G}$. Finally, the bubble contracts. The porosity of the hot low-density
gas in ISM is reduced, taking the effect of the magnetic field into account.

in the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation, as expressed by a halo merger
history of the Galaxy. This model accurately reproduces the ""metallicity

Galactic halo. The observed MDF and the apparent absence of true Population III
stars from the halo strongly imply that there is some critical metallicity,
Z_crit <~ 10^-4 Z_sun, below which low-mass star formation is inhibited, and
perhaps impossible. The observed constraints from the halo MDF, relative metal
abundances from Galactic halo stars, and the ionizing photon budget needed to
reionize the IGM together imply a stellar IMF that is peaked in the range of
massive stars that experience core-collapse supernovae, with mean mass <M> = 8
- 42 Msun. This mass range is similar to the masses predicted by models of
primordial star formation that account for formation feedback. The model also
implies that metal-poor halo stars below [Fe/H] <~ -3 had only 1 - 10
metal-free stars as their supernova precursors, such that the relative
abundances in these halo stars exhibit IMF-weighted averages over the intrinsic
yields of the first supernovae. This paper is the first part of a long term
project to connect the high-redshift in situ indicators of early star formation

sufficient energy is supplied to the central regions of galaxy clusters to
balance the effect of radiative cooling. Here we present the results of a
simulated, high-resolution, 3-d Virgo cluster for different values of thermal
conductivity (1, 1/10, 1/100, 0 times the full Spitzer value). Starting from an
initially isothermal cluster atmosphere we allow the cluster to evolve freely
over timescales of roughly $ 1.3-4.7 \times 10^{9} $ yrs. Our results show that
thermal conductivity at the Spitzer value can increase the central ICM
radiative cooling time by a factor of roughly 3.6. In addition, for larger
values of thermal conductvity the simulated temperature and density profiles
match the observations significantly better than for the lower values. However,
no physically meaningful value of thermal conductivity was able to postpone the
cooling catastrophe (characterised by a rapid increase in the central density)
for longer than a fraction of the Hubble time nor explain the absence of a
strong cooling flow in the Virgo cluster today. We also calculate the effective
adiabatic index of the cluster gas for both simulation and observational data
and compare the values with theoretical expectations. Using this method it
appears that the Virgo cluster is being heated in the cluster centre by a
mechanism other than thermal conductivity. Based on this and our simulations it
is also likely that the thermal conductvity is suppressed by a factor of at
least 10 and probably more. Thus, we suggest that thermal conductvity, if
present at all, has the effect of slowing down the evolution of the ICM, by
radiative cooling, but only by a factor of a few.

all the observational effects influencing arc detection in the real dataset,

optically thick disk material in quiescent black hole binaries, specifically
focusing on a case study of the prototypical system A0620-00. Such material
might be expected to be present theoretically, but is usually claimed to make a
negligible contribution at optical and infrared wavelengths. The primary
argument is based on measurements of the veiling of stellar photospheric
absorption lines, in which it is assumed that the disk spectrum is featureless.
We use simulated spectra to explore the sensitivity of veiling measurements to
uncertainties in companion temperature, gravity, and metallicity. We find that
the derived veiling is extremely sensitive to a mismatch between the
temperature and metallicity of the companion and template, but that the effect
of a plausible gravity mismatch is much smaller. In general the resulting
uncertainty in the amount of veiling is likely to be much larger than the
usually quoted statistical uncertainty. We also simulate spectra in which the
disk has an emergent spectrum similar to the star and find that in this case,
optical veiling constraints are moderately robust. This is because the
rotational broadening of the disk is so large that the two line profiles
effectively decouple and the measurement of the depth of stellar lines is
largely unbiased by the disk component. We note, however, that this is only

thickness, which seems to disagree with the characteristic expansion of active
region magnetic fields. This is one of the most intriguing enigmas in solar
physics. We here report on the first comprehensive one-to-one comparison of
observed loops with corresponding magnetic flux tubes obtained from cotemporal
magnetic field extrapolation models. We use EUV images from TRACE, magnetograms
from the MDI instrument on SOHO, and linear force-free field extrapolations.
For each loop, we find the particular value of the force-free parameter (alpha)
that best matches the observed loop axis and then construct flux tubes using
different assumed cross sections at one footpoint (circle and ellipses with
different orientations). We find that the flux tubes expand with height by
typically twice as much as the corresponding loops. We also find that many flux
tubes are much wider at one footpoint than the other, whereas the corresponding
loops are far more symmetric. It is clear that the actual coronal magnetic
field is more complex than the models we have considered. We suggest that the
observed symmetry of loops is related to the tangling of elemental magnetic
flux strands produced by photospheric convection.

probably closer to the center. CO is not very abundant in those clouds. Hot and
diffuse gas in which the (3, 3) level is populated was not detected toward
several dense clouds and diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk where large column
densities of colder H3+ have been reported previously. Thus the newly

column densities in the CMZ suggests an ionization rate much higher than in the

fitting the Doppler-shifted spin periods. The derived orbital period and
eccentricity are consistent with those of Stella et al. (1985) obtained from
EXOSAT observations, whereas the projected semimajor axis and the periastron
longitude are found to have changed from 48$\pm$4 to 86$^{+6}_{-10}$ lt-s and
from 313$^{\circ}$$\pm$10 to 283$^{\circ}$$\pm$14, respectively. This would
indicate an angular speed of $\geq$ 1.5$^{\circ}$$\pm$0.8 yr$^{-1}$ for
rotation of the orbit over the past 21 years. The periastron passage time of
MJD 53367$\pm$1 is just around the time when the intensity reached maximum and
an orbital period earlier is the time when the outburst started. This
correlation resembles the behavior of a Type I outburst. During outburst the
source spun up with a rate of 8.01$^{+1.00}_{-1.14}$$\times10^{-6}$ s

the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 6300. The hard X-ray spectrum above 2 keV consists of
a Compton-thin-absorbed power law, as is often seen in Seyfert 2 galaxies. We
clearly detected rapid time variability on a time scale of about 1000 s from
the light curve above 2 keV. The excess variance of the time variability
(sigma2_RMS) is calculated to be ~0.12, and the periodogram of the light curve
is well represented by a power law function with a slope of 1.75. In contrast
with previous results from Seyfert 2 nuclei, these variability characteristics
are consistent with those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This consistency suggests that
NGC 6300 has a similar black hole mass and accretion properties as Seyfert 1
galaxies. Using the relation between time variability and central black hole
mass by Hayashida et al. (1998), the black hole mass of NGC 6300 is estimated
to be ~2.8x10^5 Mo. Taking uncertainty of this method into account, the black
hole mass is less than 10^7 Mo. Taking the bolometric luminosity of 3.3x10^43
erg/s into consideration, this yields an accretion rate of > 0.03 of the
Eddington value, and comparable with estimates from Seyfert 1 galaxies using
this method. The time variability analysis suggests that NGC 6300 actually has
a Seyfert 1 nucleus obscured by a thick matter, and more generally provides a
new pillar of support for the unified model of Seyfert galaxies based on
obscuration.

distribution of M31 GC X-ray sources' V mags is bimodal, with peaks at m_v =

candidates. The distribution of B-V color shows that,the GC X-ray sources seem
to be associated preferentially with the redder GCs, in agreement with the
previous results. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that the maximum value of the
absolute difference of B-V distributions of GC X-ray sources and GCs is
D_{max}=0.181, and the probability P=0.068 which means we can reject the

under a narrow envelope. We argue that this results from stochastic excitation,
as seen in solar oscillations. The random fluctuations in phase also support
this idea. A comparison with X Cam, a true Mira star with the same pulsation
period, and W Cyg, a true semiregular star, illustrates the basic differences
in phase behaviours. The Mira shows very stable phase, consistent with
excitation by the kappa-mechanism, whereas W Cyg shows large phase fluctuations
that imply stochastic excitation. We find L2 Pup to be intermediate, implying
that both mechanisms play a role in its pulsation. Finally, we also checked the
presence of low-dimensional chaos and could safely exclude it.

applied to Double Degenerate Binaries (DDBs) with ultrashort periods (Wu et al.

between its spin and orbital motion, so that the (non-magnetic) secondary
experiences a motional electric field when moving through the primary field
lines. This induces a current flow between the two stars and provides an
electric spin-orbit coupling mechanism for the primary. We study the combined
effect of Gravitational Wave emission and electric spin-orbit coupling on the
evolution of the primary degree of asynchronism and the associated rate of
electric current dissipation in such systems, assuming that the primary's spin
is not affected by any other mechanisms. In particular, we show that in
ultrashort period binaries the emission of GW pumps energy in the electric
circuit as to keep it steadily active. This happens despite the fact that
spin-orbit coupling can rapidly synchronize the primary, because GW represent a
slow desynchronizing mechanism steadily substracting orbital angular momentum
to the system. A slightly asynchronous steady-state is thus achieved,
determined by the balance between these two competing effects. This can be
shown to correspond to a condition where the total available electric energy is
conserved, because of GW emission, while dissipation, synchronization and
orbital shrinking continue.

However, resonant trapping can be prevented when the drift or migration rate is
sufficiently high. Using a simple Hamiltonian system for first and second order
resonances, we explore how the capture probability depends on the order of the
resonance, drift rate and initial particle eccentricity. We present scaling
factors as a function of the planet mass and resonance strength to estimate the
planetary migration rate above which the capture probability drops to less than
1/2. Applying our framework to multiple extra solar planetary systems that have
two planets locked in resonance, we estimate lower limits for the outer
planet's migration rate allowing resonance capture of the inner planet. Mean
motion resonances are comprised of multiple resonant subterms. We find that the
corotation subterm can reduce the probability of capture when the planet
eccentricity is above a critical value. We present factors that can be used to
estimate this critical planet eccentricity. Applying our framework to the
migration of Neptune, we find that Neptune's eccentricity is near the critical
value that would make its 2:1 resonance fail to capture twotinos. The capture
probability is affected by the separation between resonant subterms and so is
also a function of the precession rates of the longitudes of periapse of both

of the rim emission. We determine the locations of the blast wave (BW), contact
discontinuity (CD), and reverse shock (RS) around the rim of Tycho's supernova
remnant using a principal component analysis and other methods applied to new
Chandra data. The azimuthal-angle-averaged radius of the BW is 251"". For the CD
and RS we find average radii of 241"" and 183"", respectively. Taking account of
projection effects, we find ratios of 1:0.93:0.70 (BW:CD:RS). We show these
values to be inconsistent with adiabatic hydrodynamical models of SNR
evolution. The CD:BW ratio can be explained if cosmic ray acceleration of ions
is occurring at the forward shock. The RS:BW ratio, as well as the strong Fe Ka
emission from the Tycho ejecta, imply that the RS is not accelerating cosmic
rays. We also extract radial profiles from ~34% of the rim of Tycho and compare
them to models of surface brightness profiles behind the BW for a purely
thermal plasma with an adiabatic shock. The observed morphology of the rim is
much more strongly peaked than predicted by the model, indicating that such

properly capture hydrodynamical shock waves. In its original formulation, the
resulting numerical viscosity is large enough to suppress structure in the
velocity field on scales well above the nominal resolution limit, and to damp
the generation of turbulence by fluid instabilities. This could artificially
suppress random gas motions in the intracluster medium (ICM), which are driven
by infalling structures during the hierarchical structure formation process. We
show that this is indeed the case by analysing results obtained with an SPH
formulation where an individual, time-variable viscosity is used for each
particle (Monaghan 1997). Using test calculations involving strong shocks, we
demonstrate that this scheme captures shocks as well as the original
formulation of SPH, but, in regions away from shocks, the numerical viscosity
is much smaller. In a set of nine high-resolution simulations of cosmological
galaxy cluster formation, we find that this low--viscosity formulation of SPH
produces substantially higher levels of turbulent gas motions in the ICM,
reaching a kinetic energy content in random gas motions (measured within a 1Mpc
cube) of up to 5%-30% of the thermal energy content, depending on cluster mass.
This has also significant effects on radial gas profile. We find a central
flattening of the entropy profile and a reduction of the central gas density in
the low--viscosity scheme. Interestingly, this tends to reduce the differences
seen in SPH and adaptive mesh refinement simulations of cluster formation.
Finally, invoking a model for particle acceleration by MHD waves driven by
turbulence, we find efficient electron acceleration to power diffuse radio
emission.

present here a mesoscale theory of dislocation motion. It provides a
quantitative description of deformation and rotation, grounded in a microscopic

topological current of the Nye dislocation density tensor is derived from a
microscopic theory of glide driven by Peach-Koehler forces between dislocations

sharp dislocation walls in finite time, both with and without dislocation

density n=5 corresponding to five electrons per site, of relevance for some
Co-based compounds. However, several other cases for electron densities between
n=3 and 6 are also studied. At n=5, our results indicate a first-order
transition between a paramagnetic (PM) insulator phase and a fully-polarized
ferromagnetic (FM) state by tuning the Hund's coupling. The results also
suggest a transition from the n=5 PM insulator phase to a metallic regime by
changing the electron density, either via hole or electron doping. The behavior
of the spin, charge, and orbital correlation functions in the FM and PM states
are also described in the text and discussed. The robustness of these two
states varying parameters suggests that they may be of relevance in more
realistic higher dimensional systems as well.

dynamical methods. The self-reproducing species are here characterized by a set
of binary traits and interact based on complementarity. In the case of an
extensive number of traits we use path-integral techniques to demonstrate how
the coupled dynamics of the system can be formulated in terms of an effective
single-species process in the thermodynamic limit, and how persistent order
parameters characterizing the stationary states may be computed from this
process in agreement with existing replica studies of the statics. Numerical
simulations confirm these results. The analysis of the dynamics allows an
interpretation of two different types of phase transitions of the model in
terms of memory onset at finite and diverging integrated response,
respectively. We extend the analysis to the case of diluted couplings of an
arbitrary symmetry, where replica theory is not applicable. Finally the
dynamics and in particular the approach to the stationary state of the model
with a finite number of traits is addressed.

to the excitation the unidirectional anisotropy and, thus, the exchange
coupling across the interface between the ferromagnetic and the
antiferromagnetic layer is reduced, leading to a fast reduction of the exchange
bias field and to a dramatic increase of the zero-field susceptibility. The
fast optical unpinning is followed by a slower recovery of the interfacial
exchange coupling dominated by spin-lattice and heat flow relaxation with a
time constant of the order of 160 ps. The measured picosecond time evolution of
the exchange decoupling and restoration is interpreted as an anisotropy pulse
field giving rise to fast precessional magnetization dynamics of the
ferromagnetic layer. The strength of the internal pulse field and even the
initial magnetization deflection direction from the equilibrium orientation can

The non-perturbative approximation scheme is based on a systematic expansion of
the two-particle irreducible effective action in powers of the inverse number
of field components. This yields dynamic equations which contain direct
scattering, memory and ``off-shell'' effects that are not captured by the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. This is relevant to account for the dynamics of,
e.g., strongly interacting quantum gases atoms near a scattering resonance, or
of one-dimensional Bose gases in the Tonks-Girardeau regime. We apply the
theory to a homogeneous ultracold Bose gas in one spatial dimension.
Considering the time evolution of an initial state far from equilibrium we show
that it quickly evolves to a non-equilibrium quasistationary state and discuss
the possibility to attribute an effective temperature to it. The approach to
thermal equilibrium is found to be extremely slow.

on an $AdS$ 3-brane, with curvature radius $\ell$, in $AdS_5$ bulk with radius
$L$. The solution is a gravitational shock wave. We use it to explore the
dynamics of locally localized tensor gravitons over a wide range of scales. At
distances below $L$ the shock wave looks exactly like the $5D$ $GR$ solution.
Beyond $L$ the solution approximates very closely the shock wave in 4D $AdS$
space all the way out to distances $\ell^3/L^2$ along the brane. At distances
between $L$ and $\ell$, the effective 4D graviton is a composite built of the
ultralight mode and heavier gravitons, whereas between $\ell$ and $\ell^3/L^2$
it is just the ultralight mode. Finally beyond $\ell^3/L^2$ the shock reveals a
glimpse of the fifth dimension, since the ultralight mode wave function decays
to zero at the rate inherited from the full $5D$ geometry. We obtain the
precise bulk-side formula for the 4D Planck mass, defined as the coupling of
the ultralight mode, in terms of the $5D$ Planck mass and the curvature radii.
It includes higher-order corrections in $L/\ell$, and reduces to the RS2
formula in the limit $\ell \to \infty$. We discuss $AdS/CFT$ interpretation of
these results, and argue that the spatial variation of the effective
gravitational coupling read from the shock wave amplitude corresponds to RG
running driven by quantum effects in the dual $CFT$.

lightlike brane- (WILL-brane) equations of motion in various gravitational
models of physical relevance exhibiting various new phenomena. In D=4 the
WILL-membrane serves as a material and charged source for gravity and
electromagnetism in the coupled Einstein-Maxwell-WILL-membrane system; it
automatically positions itself on (``straddles'') the common event horizon of
the corresponding matching black hole solutions, thus providing an explicit
dynamical realization of the membrane paradigm in black hole physics. In
product spaces of interest in Kaluza-Klein theories the WILL-brane wraps
non-trivially around the compact (internal)dimensions and still describes
massless mode dynamics in the non-compact (space-time) dimensions. Due to
nontrivial variable size of the internal compact dimensions we find new types
of physically interesting solutions describing massless brane modes trapped on
bounded planar circular orbits with non-trivial angular momentum, and with
linear dependence between energy and angular momentum.

consisting of weakly interacting chaotic subsystems, as a toy model to analyze
the interplay between single-particle chaotic dynamics and particles
interactions in thermodynamic systems. We study the growth with time of the
Boltzmann entropy, S_B, in this system as a function of the coarse graining
resolution. We show that a characteristic scale emerges, and that the behavior
of S_B vs t, at variance with the Gibbs entropy, does not depend on the coarse
graining resolution, as far as it is finer than this scale. The interaction
among particles is crucial to achieve this result, while the rate of entropy
growth depends essentially on the single-particle chaotic dynamics (for t not
too small). It is possible to interpret the basic features of the dynamics in
terms of a suitable Markov approximation.

states derived by linear optics from single photons. Although this no
nlinearity is nondeterministic, it is sufficient in principle to allow scalable
linear optics quantum computation (LOQC). The most obvious way to encode a
qubit optically is as a superposition of the vacuum and a single photon in one
mode -- so-called ""single-rail"" logic. Until now this approach was thought to
be prohibitively expensive (in resources) compared to ""dual-rail"" logic where a
qubit is stored by a photon across two modes. Here we attack this problem with
real-time feedback control, which can realize a quantum-limited phase
measurement on a single mode, as has been recently demonstrated experimentally.
We show that with this added measurement resource, the resource requirements
for single-rail LOQC are not substantially different from those of dual-rail
LOQC. In particular, with adaptive phase measurements an arbitrary qubit state
$\alpha \ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$ can be prepared deterministically.

and reflection. These times are valid both for the stationary and
time-dependent scattering processes, without any restrictions on the shape of
Gaussian-like wave packets. We show that in the stationary case both the Larmor
times coincide with the corresponding dwell times obtained in quant-ph/0502073.
The Larmor-time concept gives the way to verify the approach presented in
quant-ph/0405028.

as decoherence, generated by the measurement. Our results show how the quantum
precision limit can be improved by a proper design of a measurement procedure.

A 72, 042334 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.042334",,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We study numerically the behavior of continuous-time quantum walks over
networks which are topologically equivalent to square lattices. On short time
scales, when placing the initial excitation at a corner of the network, we
observe a fast, directed transport through the network to the opposite corner.
This transport is not ballistic in nature, but rather produced by quantum
mechanical interference. In the long time limit, certain walks show an
asymmetric limiting probability distribution; this feature depends on the
starting site and, remarkably, on the precise size of the network. The limiting
probability distributions show patterns which are correlated with the initial
condition. This might have consequences for the application of continuous time
quantum walk algorithms.

experiment, as points of departure, and making symmetry assumptions, the link
towards quantum theory developed in Helland (2005a,b) is surveyed and
clarified. The quantum Hilbert space is constructed from the parameters of the
various experiments using group representation theory. It is shown under
natural assumptions that a subset of the set of unit vectors of this space, the
generalized coherent state vectors, can be put in correspondence with questions
of the kind: What is the value of the (complete) parameter? - together with a
crisp answer to that question. Links are made to statistical models in general,
to model reduction of overparametrized models and to the design of experiments.
It turns out to be essential that the range of the statistical parameter is an
invariant set under the relevant symmetry group.
