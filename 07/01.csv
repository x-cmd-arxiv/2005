significant constraints on the axis ratios and orientation of a triaxial model

Dark Matter models of galaxy formation and may be used to probe the nature of

quantify. We show how proper motion measurements of several HVSs could
simultaneously resolve the distance degeneracies of all such stars and produce
a detailed picture of the triaxial halo. Additional HVSs may be found from
radial velocity surveys or from parallax/proper-motion data derived from GAIA.
High-precision proper-motion measurements of these stars using the Space

greatest value reported so far in any redshifted damped Ly$\alpha$ system. This
results from the combined effect of a relatively high dust-to-gas ratio, a low
gas temperature, and an extremely low ambient UV radiation field. Based on the
observed population of $J$ states, we estimate the photo-absorption rate to be
$R_{\rm abs}=(7.6\pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13} {\rm s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a
local UV radiation field of $J(1000{\rm \AA})\approx 2.1\times 10^{-3}

at $1000 \AA$ in the solar neighborhood. This is comparable with the

low star formation rate in the absorber's environment. The observed CO-to-H$_2$
column density ratio is $\frac{N_{\rm CO}}{N_{\rm H_2}}<2.5\times 10^{-7}$,
which is similar to the value measured for diffuse molecular clouds in the

incorporates elements of and unifies the two seemingly divergent dominant

expansion theory. Whole-Earth decompression is the consequence of Earth
formation from within a Jupiter-like protoplanet with subsequent loss of gases
and ices and concomitant rebounding. The initial whole-Earth decompression is
expected to result in a global system of major primary decompression cracks
appearing in the rigid crust which persist as the basalt feeders for the
global, mid-oceanic ridge system. As the Earth subsequently decompresses, the
area of the Earth's surface increases by the formation of secondary
decompression cracks, often located near the continental margins, presently
identified as oceanic trenches. These secondary decompression cracks are
subsequently in-filled with basalt, extruded from the mid-oceanic ridges, which
traverses the ocean floor by gravitational creep, ultimately plunging into
secondary decompression cracks, emulating subduction. Much of the evidence
presented in support of plate tectonics supports Whole-Earth Decompression
Dynamics, but without necessitating mantle convection/circulation or basalt
re-cycling. Moreover, the timescale for Earth decompression is not constrained
to the last 200 million years, the maximum age of the current ocean floor.

``flare-normal'' mode, where the core is regularly bright and a nearly 4-period

Short 5--15-pulse ``flare-normal''-mode ``bursts'' and ``quiet normal''
intervals alternate with each other quasi-periodically, making a cycle some
60--80 pulses in duration. ``Abnormal''-mode intervals are interspersed within
this overall cycle, usually persisting for only a few pulses, but occasionally
lasting for scores or even many hundreds of pulses. Within subsequences where
the core is exceptionally quiet, the pulsar provides a nearly ``textbook''
example of a central PA sightline traverse--with a PA rate measured to be at
least some 180$\deg/\deg$. On this basis it is shown that the sightline impact
angle $\beta$ must be about 0.25\degr or some 5% of the outer conal beam
radius. The star's core component is found to be incomplete, despite the fact
that the core's full antisymmetric circularly polarized signature is present.
We find that the star's PA traverse is disrupted through the action of
orthogonally polarized linear power in the longitude range of the core
component. This behavior is modeled to show its effect. Finally, the star
provides two well defined fiducial points from which emission-height estimates
can be computed, the respective centers of both the linear PA traverse and the

A exhibit the following characteristics: (1) the highly superadiabatic
transition layer (SAL) is located at much shallower optical depth; it is in a
dynamically active region, and its outer region is located part of the time in
the optically thin atmosphere; (2) the outer region of the SAL moves from an
optically thin region to thick region and back again over a time of 20-30
minutes. This motion, which is driven by the granulation, takes place in a time
approximately half the turnover time of the largest granules; The main reason
for the radically different radiative-convective behaviour in Procyon A
compared to the Sun is the role played by turbulent eddies in determining the
overall flow/thermal structure. The turbulent pressure and turbulent kinetic
energy can exceed 50 % of the local gas pressure (compared to about 10-20 % in
the Sun). The Procyon A simulation thus reveals two distinct timescales - the
autocorrelation time of the vertical velocity and the characteristic timescale
of the SAL which is tied to granulation. Just below the surface the
autocorrelation decay time is about 5 minutes in Procyon A, and the SAL motion
timescale is 20-30 mins. When the SAL penetrates the optically thin region
there are efficient radiative losses and the peak of the SAL is low. We
speculate that these losses damp out the relative amplitudes in luminosity
(temperature fluctuations) compared to velocity (Doppler). Although this will
not affect the frequencies of the peaks in the power spectrum, it will probably
lower the average amplitude of the peaks relative to the noise background.

Spitzer Science Center for astronomical image processing. We report on the
point source extraction capabilities of MOPEX. Point source extraction is
implemented as a two step process: point source detection and profile fitting.
Non-linear matched filtering of input images can be performed optionally to
increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve detection of faint point
sources. Point Response Function (PRF) fitting of point sources produces the
final point source list which includes the fluxes and improved positions of the
point sources, along with other parameters characterizing the fit. Passive and
active deblending allows for successful fitting of confused point sources.
Aperture photometry can also be computed for every extracted point source for
an unlimited number of aperture sizes. PRF is estimated directly from the input
images. Implementation of efficient methods of background and noise estimation,
and modified Simplex algorithm contribute to the computational efficiency of
MOPEX. The package is implemented as a loosely connected set of perl scripts,
where each script runs a number of modules written in C/C++. Input parameter
setting is done through namelists, ASCII configuration files. We present
applications of point source extraction to the mosaic images taken at 24 and 70
micron with the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) as part of the Spitzer
extragalactic First Look Survey and to a Digital Sky Survey image. Completeness
and reliability of point source extraction is computed using simulated data.

peaks separated by ~1'', the East (E) and West (W) components, that correspond
to each galactic nucleus of the merger. The spectral indices for both the E and

Anantharamaiah et al. This agreement with the models implies the presence of
high-density (~ 100,000 cm^-3) compact HII regions (~ 0.1 pc) in Arp 220. The
integrated H53alpha line emission is stronger toward the non-thermal radio
continuum peaks, which are also coincident with the peaks of molecular emission

  Reionization","11 pages, submitted to ApJL",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The physical basis for the belief that the abundant old dwarf galaxies seen
in present-day galaxy clusters formed before reionization of the universe is
very compelling, because (1) the observed faint end slope of the galaxy
luminosity function ascends from a shallower slope at brighter magnitudes and
tracks that of dark matter halo mass function, and (2) that steep power-law
slope is observed to extend all the way to galaxies of inferred velocity
dispersion of ~10km/s. We then show that the number of ionizing photons emitted
by these dwarf galaxies should be able to produce an H II region at least as
large as each proto-cluster region, occupying at least 20% of the entire IGM
volume at z >= 6. A more likely scenario is that our estimate of the ionizing
photon production rate based on these dwarfs under-estimates the true rate from
proto-clusters by a factor of ~5 for a variety of physically plausible reasons,
in which case a fully self- consistent picture emerges. Specific implications
include (1) Strong clustering of sources would collectively produce very large
individual H II regions of sizes up to ~100Mpc before overlapping with others,
having important implications for upcoming radio and CMB observations. There
should be large spatial fluctuations of neutral fraction in the intergalactic
medium up to cluster scales of ~100Mpc. We give an H II region size function.
(2) The ionizing sources at z~6 are expected to be highly biased with a bias
factor >=15. (3) Large H II regions would enable largely unattenuated
transmission of flux of a significant number of sources prior to reionization.
When more sensitive observations become available, one should expect to see
clusters of fainter sources in the vicinity of known galaxies at z>6.

15 and 17 Angstrom by means of unresolved (inner-shell) transition arrays
(UTAs) of Fe M-shell ions. The outflow velocities implied by the Doppler shifts
of the individual UTAs in the spectrum have never before been measured. Thus,
the Fe-M absorber has been commonly assumed to be part of the ionized AGN
outflow, whose velocities are readily obtained from more easily measured
spectral lines. The best spectrum of Fe-M absorption is available from the
integrated 900 ks Chandra HETGS observations of NGC 3783, in which some Fe-M
ions are clearly resolved. We measure the velocities of the individual Fe-M
ions in NGC 3783 for the first time. Surprisingly, we find that the Fe-M
absorber, most noticeably Fe$^{+8}$, Fe$^{+9}$, and Fe$^{+10}$, is not
outflowing at the same velocity as the previously known wind. In fact, it
appears to be stationary and therefore not part of the outflow at all. It
could, alternatively, be ascribed to the skin of the dusty torus. This reduces
appreciably the mass loss rate estimated for the NGC 3783 outflow and perhaps
for other similar sources as well, in which the various Fe-M ions are not
resolved.

However, direct and convincing evidence that SNRs produce CR nuclei has not yet
been obtained and may, in fact, be long in coming if current gamma-ray
observatories do not see an unambiguous pion-decay feature. Nevertheless, the
lack of an observed pion-decay feature does not necessarily mean that CR ions
are not abundantly produced since ions do not radiate efficiently. If CR ions
are produced efficiently by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), their presence
will modify the hydrodynamics of the SNR and produce morphological effects
which can be clearly seen in radiation produced by electrons. We describe in
some detail our CR-hydro model, which couples DSA with the remnant
hydrodynamics, and the synchrotron emission expected for two distinct parameter
sets representing type Ia and type II supernovae. Several morphological
features emerge in radial profiles, including the forward shock precursor,
which are observable with current X-ray observatories and which should
definitively show if young SNRs produce CR ions efficiently or not. For the
specific case of SN 1006, we conclude, as have others, that the extremely short
X-ray scale heights observed near the outer shock argue convincingly for the
efficient production of CR ions.

quasi-particle and pseudopotential approximations for a number of inorganic
semiconductors whose electronic structures are well known from experiment.
Iterating just the quasi-particle energies yields a systematic, but modest
overestimate of the band gaps, confirming conclusions drawn earlier for CaB_6
and YH_3. Iterating the quasi-particle wave functions as well gives rise to an
imbalance between the Hartree and Fock potentials and results in bandgaps in
far poorer agreement with experiment.

Abrikosov flux flow dissipation can only be measured up to $T_{c}$. This may
point to different vortices below and above $T_{c}$ if we attribute the strong

the dissipation may be caused by the motion of the spontaneously generated

the theoretical background that explains their appearance. We treat separately
two classes of chains: those that appear in superconductors with moderate
anisotropy due to an attractive part of the interaction between tilted flux
lines, and those with high anisotropy where the tilted magnetic flux is created
by two independent and perpendicular crossing lattices. In the second case it
is the indirect attraction between a flux line along the layers (Josephson
vortex) and a flux line perpendicular to the layers (pancake vortex stack) that
leads to the formation of chains of the pancake vortex stacks. This complex
system contains a rich variety of phenomena, with several different equilibrium
phases, and an extraordinary dynamic interplay between the two sets of crossing
vortices. We compare the theoretical predictions of these phenomena with the
experimental observations made to date. We also contrast the different
techniques used to make these observations. While it is clear that this system
forms a wonderful playground for probing the formation of structures with
competing interactions, we conclude that there are important practical
implications of the vortex chains that appear in highly anisotropic
superconductors.

stochastic equations that in the limit of many realizations correspond exactly
to the full quantum evolution. These are obtained using the stochastic gauge
method (derived here), an extension of the positive P phase-space
representation.
  The systems investigated are: 1) Dynamics of spatial correlations in uniform
1D and 2D Bose gases after the rapid appearance of significant two-body
collisions (e.g. after entering a Feshbach resonance). 2) Dynamics of
stimulated Bose enhancement of scattered atom modes during the collision of two
Bose-Einstein condensates with a mean of 150 000 atoms. 3) Dynamics of trapped
bosons, where the size of the trap is of the same order as the range of the
interparticle potential. 4) Grand canonical thermodynamics of uniform 1D Bose
gases for a variety of temperatures and collision strengths. Observables
calculated include 1st-3rd order spatial correlation functions (including
finite separation) and momentum distributions.
  The stochastic gauge method is derived, and its application to interacting

effectiveness under many conditions, and to be capable of overcoming
instability and boundary term problems. Additionally, conditions under which
very generalized phase-space represntations can be used to obtain tractable

whose longitudinal polarizations are linear combinations of the
extra-dimensional components, and a tower of heavy spin-0 particles

on the Kaluza-Klein numbers, and are independent of the gauge fixing. If the
gauge symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value of a six-dimensional

representation mix to provide the longitudinal polarization of the spin-1 mode,

section gamma+gamma->h->b+bbar at the Photon Collider is studied in detail for
M_h=120-160 GeV. All relevant experimental and theoretical issues, which could
affect the measurement, are taken into account. The study is based on the
realistic gamma-gamma luminosity spectra simulation. The heavy-quark background
gamma+gamma->Q+Qbar(+g) is estimated using the NLO QCD results. Other
background processes, which were neglected in earlier analyses, are also
studied: gamma+gamma->W+W, gamma+gamma->tau+tau and light-quark pair production
gamma+gamma->q+qbar. The contribution from the so-called overlaying events,
gamma+gamma->hadrons, is taken into account. The non-zero beam crossing angle
and the finite size of colliding bunches are included in the event generation.
The detector simulation and realistic b-tagging are used. Criteria of event
selection are optimized separately for each considered Higgs-boson mass. In
spite of the significant background contribution and deterioration of the
invariant mass resolution due to overlaying events, precise measurement of the
Higgs-boson production cross section is still possible. For the Standard-Model
Higgs boson with mass of 120 to 160 GeV the corresponding partial width

gamma+gamma->A,H->b+bbar and the ""discovery reach"" of the Photon Collider are
compared for different MSSM scenarios. The analysis takes into account all
relevant theoretical and experimental issues which could affect the

tan(beta)=7, the statistical precision of the cross-section determination is
estimated to be 8-34%, after one year of Photon Collider running, for four
considered MSSM parameters sets. As heavy neutral Higgs bosons in this scenario
may not be discovered at LHC or at the first stage of the e+e- collider, an
opportunity of being a discovery machine is also studied for the Photon

vector BRST topological symmetry operators. This determines an off-shell closed
sector of N=4 SuperYang-Mills, with 6 generators, which is big enough to fully
determine the theory, in a Lorentz covariant way. This reduced algebra derives
from horizontality conditions in four dimensions. The horizontality conditions
only depend on the geometry of the Yang-Mills fields. They also descend from a
genuine horizontality condition in eight dimensions. In fact, the SL(2,R)
symmetry is induced by a dimensional reduction from eight to seven dimensions,
which establishes a ghost-antighost symmetry, while the SU(2) symmetry occurs
by dimensional reduction from seven to four dimensions. When the four
dimensional manifold is hyperKahler, one can perform a twist operation that
defines the N=4 supersymmetry and its SL(2,H)\sim SU(4) R-symmetry in flat
space. (For defining a TQFT on a more general four manifold, one can use the
internal SU(2)-symmetry and redefine a Lorentz SO(4) invariance). These results
extend in a covariant way the light cone property that the N=4 SuperYang-Mills
theory is actually determined by only 8 independent generators, instead of the
16 generators that occur in the physical representation of the superPoincare
algebra. The topological construction disentangles the off-shell closed sector
of the (twisted) maximally supersymmetric theory from the (irrelevant) sector
that closes only modulo equations of motion. It allows one to escape the
question of auxiliary fields in N=4 SuperYang-Mills theory.

with the extension property; moreover, E(C) coincides with Kumjian's twist in
the context of C*-diagonals. We identify the C*-envelope of a subalgebra A of a
C*-diagonal which contains D. For triangular subalgebras, each containing the
MASA, a bounded isomorphism induces an algebraic isomorphism of the coordinate
systems which can be shown to be continuous in certain cases. For subalgebras,
each containing the MASA, a bounded isomorphism that maps one MASA to the other
MASA induces an isomorphism of the coordinate systems. We show that the weak
operator closure of the image of a triangular algebra in an appropriate
representation is a CSL algebra and that bounded isomorphism of triangular
algebras extends to an isomorphism of these CSL algebras. We prove that for
triangular algebras in our context, any bounded isomorphism is completely
bounded. Our methods simplify and extend various known results; for example,
isometric isomorphisms of the triangular algebras extend to isometric
isomorphisms of the C*-envelopes, and the conditional expectation E of C onto D
is multiplicative when restricted to a triangular subalgebra. Also, we use our

bounded above by $\log(2 + \sqrt{3})/g$. It follows that the asymptotic

observed at incident energies 180 and 240 MeV. At each incident energy, the
doubly differential cross section was measured at three to five outgoing pion
laboratory angles between 25 deg and 130 deg. At each angle, cross sections
were measured over the range of outgoing pion energies from 10 MeV up to the
kinematic limit for the reaction in which the final state consists of the
oppositely charged pion plus four free nucleons.
  The spectra of outgoing pions are strikingly different from those observed
for the inclusive double charge exchange reaction in heavier nuclei, but
resemble those observed in the (pi-,pi+) reaction in 3He. The forward-angle
spectra in the 3He and 4He reactions exhibit a prominent peak at high outgoing
pion energies. Interpretation of the peaks in 3He (4He) as a three-
(four-)nucleon resonance is ruled out by kinematic analysis. The results of a
calculation, wherein the double charge exchange reaction is assumed to proceed
as two sequential single charge exchange interactions, suggest that the
high-energy peak is naturally explained by this double scattering mechanism.
Non-static treatment of the pi-N interactions and the inclusion of nuclear
binding effects appear to be important in reproducing the shape of the energy
spectra at forward angles.

faculty members at the `top 50' universities that were examined, approximately
100 were female, and around 1425 had available biographical data.
  Based on this data, the predicted fractions of female faculty members at the

Radiation. Our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specific
predictions of Undulator Radiation cross-spectral density in various parts of
the beamline. On the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assume
that the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely
on the application of van Cittert-Zernike (VCZ) theorem, in its original or
generalized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-field
approximation. The VCZ theorem is derived in the frame of Statistical Optics
using a number of restrictive assumptions: in particular, the quasi-homogeneous
assumption is demonstrated to be inaccurate in many practical situations
regarding undulator sources. We propose a technique to calculate the
cross-spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case. Also,
we find the region of applicability of the quasi-homogeneous model and we
present an analytical expression for the cross-spectral density which is valid
up to the exit of the undulator. For the case of more general undulator
sources, simple formulas for the transverse coherence length, interpolated from
numerical calculations and suitable for beamline design applications are found.
Finally, using a simple vertical slit, we show how transverse coherence
properties of an X-ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a larger coherent
spot-size on a sample. This invention was devised almost entirely on the basis
of theoretical ideas developed throughout this paper.

Zhaoping & Hertz ([2002] Neural Computation 14(10):2371-96), explains the theta
phase precession phenomena. In our model, the theta phase precession comes out
as a consequence of the associative-memory-like network dynamics, i.e. the
network's ability to imprint and recall oscillatory patterns, coded both by
phases and amplitudes of oscillation. The learning rule used to imprint the
oscillatory states is a natural generalization of that used for static patterns
in the Hopfield model, and is based on the spike time dependent synaptic
plasticity (STDP), experimentally observed. In agreement with experimental
findings, the place cell's activity appears at consistently earlier phases of
subsequent cycles of the ongoing theta rhythm during a pass through the place
field, while the oscillation amplitude of the place cell's firing rate
increases as the animal approaches the center of the place field and decreases
as the animal leaves the center. The total phase precession of the place cell
is lower than 360 degrees, in agreement with experiments. As the animal enters
a receptive field the place cell's activity comes slightly less than 180
degrees after the phase of maximal pyramidal cell population activity, in
agreement with the findings of Skaggs et al (1996). Our model predicts that the
theta phase is much better correlated with location than with time spent in the
receptive field. Finally, in agreement with the recent experimental findings of
Zugaro et al (2005), our model predicts that theta phase precession persists
after transient intra-hippocampal perturbation.

the observed outcome has to affirm that property with certainty, hence in this

argument that there exist classical properties of an observer that he cannot

functions are shown to differ from the Boson functions in so far as the ladder
operators $M_+$ ($M_-$) that ascend (descend) the sequence of harmonics over
the values of $m$ for a given value of $\ell$, do not produce the expected
result {\em in just one case}: when the value of $m$ changes from $\pm{1/2}$ to
$\mp{1/2}$; i.e. when $m$ changes sign; in all other cases the ladder operators
produce the usually expected result including anihilation when a ladder
operator attempts to take $m$ outside the range: $-\ell\le m\le +\ell$.

operators relating states with different eigenvalues are not essential, and are
