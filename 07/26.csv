development of the transverse Weibel instability provide effective
collisionality in unmagnetized collisionless shocks. Recently, extensive two
and three dimensional simulations improved our understanding of the growth and
saturation of the instability in colliding plasma shells. However, the
steady-state structure of the shock wave transition layers remains poorly
understood. We use basic physical considerations and order-of-magnitude
arguments to study the steady state structure in relativistic unmagnetized
collisionless shocks in pair plasmas. The shock contains an electrostatic layer
resulting from the formation of stationary, magnetically-focused current
filaments. The filaments form where the cold upstream plasma and the
counterstreaming thermal plasma interpenetrate. The filaments are not entirely
neutral and strong electrostatic fields are present. Most of the downstream
particles cannot cross this layer into the upstream because they are trapped by
the electrostatic field. We identify the critical location in the shock
transition layer where the electromagnetic field ceases to be static. At this
location, the degree of charge separation in the filaments reaches a maximum
value, the current inside the filaments comes close to the Alfv\'en limit, and
the phase space distribution function starts to isotropize. We argue that the
radius of the current filaments upstream of the critical location is about
twice the upstream plasma skin depth. Finally, we show that some downstream
particles cross the electrostatic layer and run ahead of the shock into the
preshock medium without causing instability. These particles may play an
important role in particle acceleration.

photometric data shows substantial evolution in the width and depth of the
eclipses. The most recent data indicate that the eclipses are now approximately
24 days in length, or half the orbital period. These results are interpreted
and discussed in the context of the recent models for this system put forward
by Winn et al. and Chiang & Murray-Clay. A periodogram of the entire data set
yields a highly significant peak at 48.37 +/- 0.01 days, which is in accord
with the spectroscopic period of 48.38 +/- 0.01 days determined by Johnson et
al. Another significant peak, at 9.6 days, was found in the periodogram of the
out-of-eclipse data at two different epochs. We interpret this as the rotation
period of the visible star and argue that it may be tidally locked in
pseudosynchronism with its orbital motion. If so, application of Hut's theory
implies that the eccentricity of the orbit is e = 0.65 +/- 0.01. Analysis of
the UVES/VLT spectra obtained by Hamilton et al. shows that the v sin(i) of the
visible star in this system is 6.9 +/- 0.3 km/sec. Using this value of v sin(i)
and the measured rotation period of the star, we calculate the lower limit on
the radius to be R = (1.3 +/- 0.1), R_Sun, which concurs with the value
obtained by Hamilton et al. from its luminosity and effective temperature. Here
we assume that i = 90 degrees since it is likely that the spin and orbital
angular momenta vectors are nearly aligned.

  227, eds: R. Cesaroni et al",,"10.1017/S1743921305004837",,"astro-ph",,"  Theoretical considerations lead to the expectation that stars should not have
masses larger than about m_{max*}=60-120Msun, while the observational evidence
has been ambiguous. Only very recently has a physical stellar mass limit near
150Msun emerged thanks to modern high-resolution observations of local
star-burst clusters. But this limit does not appear to depend on metallicity,
in contradiction to theory. Important uncertainties remain though. It is now
also emerging that star-clusters limit the masses of their constituent stars,
such that a well-defined relation between the mass of the most massive star in
a cluster and the cluster mass, m_{max}=F(M_ecl) \le m_{max*}\approx 150Msun,
exists. One rather startling finding is that the observational data strongly
favour clusters being built-up by consecutively forming more-massive stars
until the most massive stars terminate further star-formation. The relation
also implies that composite populations, which consist of many star clusters,
most of which may be dissolved, must have steeper composite IMFs than simple
stellar populations such as are found in individual clusters. Thus, for
example, 10^5 Taurus--Auriga star-forming groups, each with 20 stars, will ever
only sample the IMF below about 1Msun. This IMF will therefore not be identical
to the IMF of one cluster with 2 times 10^6 stars. The implication is that the
star-formation history of a galaxy critically determines its integrated
galaxial IMF and thus the total number of supernovae per star and its chemical
enrichment history. Galaxy formation and evolution models that rely on an
invariant IMF would be wrong.

variability information from a series of images. Differential photometry is
generally best accomplished by subtracting two images separated in time, since
this removes all constant objects in the field. By removing background sources
such as the host galaxies of supernovae, such subtractions make possible the
measurement of the proper flux of point-source objects superimposed on extended
sources. In traditional difference photometry, a single image is designated as
the ``template'' image and subtracted from all other observations. This
procedure does not take all the available information into account and for
sub-optimal template images may produce poor results. Given N total
observations of an object, we show how to obtain an estimate of the vector of
fluxes from the individual images using the antisymmetric matrix of flux
differences formed from the N(N-1)/2 distinct possible subtractions and provide
a prescription for estimating the associated uncertainties. We then demonstrate
how this method improves results over the standard procedure of designating one

transfer in the most realistic case of a dusty, multi-phase medium has not
received detailed theoretical attention. We investigate resonant scattering
through an ensemble of dusty, moving, optically thick gas clumps. We treat each
clump as a scattering particle and use Monte Carlo simulations of surface
scattering to quantify continuum and Ly-alpha surface scattering angles,
absorption probabilities, and frequency redistribution, as a function of the
gas dust content. This atomistic approach speeds up the simulations by many
orders of magnitude, making possible calculations which are otherwise
intractable. With these surface scattering results, we develop an analytic
framework for estimating escape fractions and line widths as a function of gas
geometry, motion, and dust content. We show that the key geometric parameter is
the average number of surface scatters for escape in the absence of absorption.
We consider two interesting applications: (i) Equivalent widths. Ly-alpha can
preferentially escape from a dusty multi-phase ISM if most of the dust lies in
cold neutral clouds, possibly explaining anomalously high EWs seen in many high
redshift/submm sources. (ii) Multi-phase galactic outflows. We show the

understanding density structures and their statistics in turbulent media is of

spectra, $P_{\rho}$, of transonic and supersonic turbulent flows through one
and three-dimensional simulations of driven, isothermal hydrodynamic turbulence
with root-mean-square Mach number in the range of $1 \la M_{\rm rms} \la 10$.
  From one-dimensional experiments we find that the slope of the density power
spectra becomes gradually shallower as the rms Mach number increases. It is
because the density distribution transforms from the profile with {\it
discontinuities} having $P_{\rho} \propto k^{-2}$ for $M_{\rm rms} \sim 1$ to
the profile with {\it peaks} having $P_{\rho} \propto k^0$ for $M_{\rm rms} \gg
1$. We also find that the same trend is carried to three-dimension; that is,
the density power spectrum flattens as the Mach number increases. But the
density power spectrum of the flow with $M_{\rm rms} \sim 1$ has the Kolmogorov
slope. The flattening is the consequence of the dominant density structures of
{\it filaments} and {\it sheets}. Observations have claimed different slopes of
density power spectra for electron density and cold H I gas in the interstellar
medium. We argue that while the Kolmogorov spectrum for electron density
reflects the {\it transonic} turbulence of $M_{\rm rms} \sim 1$ in the warm

We find a number of galaxies with extended HI tails, almost all pointing away
from the cluster center. Truncated HI disks are found close to the center but
also in the outer region. Some galaxies near the cluster center show
compression of the gas on one side. Multiwavelength data of NGC 4569 and
kinematics on NGC 4396 indicate that some of the HI is extra-planar. These
preliminary results on the HI morphology already suggest that a variety of
environmental effects such as ICM-ISM interactions, harassment, tidal
interactions or mergers may be at work to affect the evolution of galaxies.

Presupernova evolution is calculated in spherical symmetry. Collapse and
explosion are calculated by a two-dimensional code, based on the bipolar jet
models. We compare the results of nucleosynthesis with the abundance patterns
of intracluster matter, hot gases in M82, and extremely metal-poor stars in the
Galactic halo. It was found that both 500$M_{\odot}$ and 1000$M_{\odot}$ models
enter the region of pair-instability but continue to undergo core collapse. In
the presupernova stage, silicon burning regions occupy a large fraction, more
than 20% of the total mass. For moderately aspherical explosions, the patterns
of nucleosynthesis match the observational data of both intracluster medium and
M82. Our results suggest that explosions of Population III core-collapse
very-massive stars contribute significantly to the chemical evolution of gases
in clusters of galaxies. For Galactic halo stars, our [O/Fe] ratios are smaller
than the observational abundances. However, our proposed scenario is naturally
consistent with this outcome. The final black hole masses are $\sim
230M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 500M_{\odot}$ for the $500M_{\odot}$ and
1000$M_{\odot}$ models, respectively. This result may support the view that
Population III very massive stars are responsible for the origin of
intermediate mass black holes which were recently reported to be discovered.

mass, and N~50 the number of efolds since the relevant modes exited the horizon
till the end of inflation. The dimensionless function w(chi) and field chi are
O(1). The WMAP value for the amplitude of scalar adiabatic fluctuations
|\Delta_{k ad}^(S)| fixes the inflation scale M ~ 0.77 10^16 GeV precisely at
the GUT scale. This general form of the potential makes manifest that the slow
roll expansion is an expansion in 1/N. Powers of 1/N count the orders in the
slow roll expansion.This form of the inflaton potential suggests that the super
symmetry breaking scale is at the inflation and GUT scales.A Ginzburg-Landau
realization of this inflaton potential reveals that Hubble, inflaton mass and
non-linear couplings are of the see-saw form in terms of the small ratio M/M_P.
For example, the quartic coupling lambda ~ 1/N (M/M_P)^4.The smallness of the
non-linear couplings is not a result of fine tuning but a natural consequence
of the validity of the effective field theory. We clarify the Lyth bound which
relates the tensor/scalar ratio and the value of phi/M_P.Effective field theory
is valid for V(phi)<<M_P^4 allowing inflaton fields phi well beyond M_P.Thus,
no bounds based on the value of phi/M_P appear on r.In case one wishes to
restrict oneself to chi < 1 in the above potential, values for r larger than

During slow roll inflation there is a clean and unambiguous separation between
superhorizon and subhorizon contributions to the energy momentum tensor. The
superhorizon part is determined by the curvature perturbations and scalar field
fluctuations: both feature infrared enhancements as the inverse of a
combination of slow roll parameters which measure the departure from scale
invariance in each case.Fermions and gravitons do not exhibit infrared
divergences. The subhorizon part is completely specified by the trace anomaly
of the fields with different spins and is solely determined by the space-time
geometry. The one-loop quantum corrections to the amplitude of curvature and
tensor perturbations are obtained to leading order in slow-roll and in the
(H/M_PL)^2 expansion. This study provides a complete assessment of the
backreaction problem up to one loop including bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom. The result validates the effective field theory description of
inflation and confirms the robustness of the inflationary paradigm to quantum
fluctuations. Quantum corrections to the power spectra are expressed in terms
of the CMB observables:n_s, r and dn_s/dln k. Trace anomalies (especially the
graviton part) dominate these quantum corrections in a definite direction: they
enhance the scalar curvature fluctuations and reduce the tensor fluctuations.

result from the spill-over of the extended chromosphere, possibly associated
with the action of waves, especially Alfven waves, which are used as guidance
in the derivation of the new formula. We obtain a relation akin to the original
Reimers law, but which includes two new factors. They reflect how the
chromospheric height depends on gravity and how the mechanical energy flux
depends, mainly, on effective temperature. The new relation is tested and
sensitively calibrated by modelling the blue end of the Horizontal Branch of
globular clusters. The most significant difference from mass loss rates
predicted by the Reimers relation is an increase by up to a factor of 3 for

strongly suggest that the period-luminosity (PL) relation for the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids shows a break or non-linearity at a period of
10 days. In this paper we apply statistical tests, the chi-square test and the
F-test, to the Cepheid data from the MACHO project to test for a non-linearity
of the V- and R-band PL relations at 10 days, and extend these tests to the
near infrared (JHK-band) PL relations with 2MASS data. We correct the
extinction for these data by applying an extinction map towards the LMC. The
statistical test we use, the F-test, is able to take account of small numbers
of data points and the nature of that data on either side of the period cut at
10 days. With our data, the results we obtained imply that the VRJH-band PL
relations are non-linear around a period of 10 days, while the K-band PL
relation is (marginally) consistent with a single-line regression. The choice
of a period of 10 days, around which this non-linearity occurs, is consistent
with the results obtained when this ""break"" period is estimated from the data.
Long period Cepheids are supplemented from the literature to increase our
sample size. The photometry of these long period Cepheids is compared with our
data and no trend with period is found. Our main results remain unchanged when
we supplement our dataset with these long period Cepheids. By examining our
data at maximum light, we also suggest arguments why errors in reddening are
unlikely to be responsible for our results. The non-linearity of the mean
V-band PL relation as seen in both of the OGLE and MACHO data, using different
extinction maps, suggests that this non-linearity is real.

parameters allowed to calculate the orbits of the stars. Nearly 1/3 of the
stars of our sample has orbits staying near the Milky Way plane. Of the 217
stars, 163 have halo-like orbits fulfilling one of the following criteria:
Theta < 100 km/s, orbit eccentricity >0.4, and normalized maximum orbital
z-distance >0.45. Of these stars roughly half have retrograde orbits. The
z-distance probability distribution of this sample shows scale heights of 1.3
+-0.1 kpc for the disk component and 4.6 +-0.3 kpc for the halo component. With
our orbit statistics method we found a (vertical) spatial distribution which,
out to z=20 kpc, is similar to that found with other methods. This distribution
is also compatible with the ones found for blue (HBA and sdB) halo stars. The
circular velocity Theta, the orbit eccentricity, orbit z-extent and [Fe/H] are
employed to look for possible correlations. If any, it is that the metal poor
stars with [Fe/H] <1.0 have a wide symmetric distribution about Theta=0. We
conclude that the Milky Way possesses a halo component of old and metal poor
stars with a scale height of 4-5 kpc having random orbits. The presence in our
sample of a few metal poor stars (thus part of the halo population) with thin
disk-like orbits is statistically not surprising. The midplane density ratio of

the surface and usually gravitation does not play an important role in this
force. But in compact stars the gravitational force on the particles is very
large and S is found to depend not only on the interactions in the strange
quark matter, but also on the structure of the star, i.e. on its mass and
radius. Indeed, it has been claimed recently that 511 keV photons observed by
the space probe INTEGRAL from the galactic bulge may be due to
electron-positron annihilation, and their source may be the positron cloud
outside of an antiquark star. Such stars, if they exist, may also go a long way
towards explaining away the antibaryon deficit of the universe. For that to
happen S must be high enough to allow for survival of quark/antiquark stars

the percolation cluster near threshold is a fractal of dimension between 1 and
2: two experimentally relevant examples are the O(2) quantum rotor and the
Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We study two analytic descriptions of the O(2)

shown to predict long-ranged order, but there are statistically rare points on
the cluster that violate the standard assumptions of spin-wave theory. A
real-space renormalization group (RSRG) approach is then used to understand how
these rare points modify ordering of the O(2) rotor. A new class of fixed

to support the existence of long-range order on the percolation backbone in two

ferroelectrics films properties in the framework of the random field theory. We
took into account the misfit strain between film and substrate as well as
surface piezoelectric effect that causes built-in electric field in the
strained films. In the statistical theory framework we calculated random field
distribution function with the electric dipoles and monopoles as the field
sources. It was shown that with thickness decrease the mean field decreases,
while the width of the distribution function increases. This leads to the
additional smearing of the phase transition in the films in comparison to the
bulk relaxors. As an example the dependence of the order parameter and
dielectric susceptibility on the film thickness, temperature and random fields
distribution function parameters was obtained. For free standing film the
existence of critical thickness of relaxor state transformation into glassy
state was predicted. Contrary to this the appearance of misfit strain induced
ferroelectric phase appeared to be possible for some pairs film-substrate. We
have shown that susceptibility temperature maximum shift with frequency in
relaxor ferroelectric thin films obeys Vogel-Fulcher law with parameters
dependent on film thickness. For the first time the analytical dependences of
freezing temperature decreases and activation energy on the thickness was
obtained, namely freezing temperature decreases and activation energy increases
with film thickness decrease. Obtained results quantitatively agree with the
available experimental data for PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 relaxor thin films.

familiar instance of which is the sound made by a sheet of paper when crumpled
into a ball. Although seemingly random, this noise contains fundamental
information about the properties of the system in which it occurs. One
potential source of such information lies in the asymmetric shape of noise
pulses emitted by a diverse range of noisy systems [8-12], but the cause of
this asymmetry has lacked explanation [1]. Here we show that the leftward
asymmetry observed in the Barkhausen effect [2] - the noise generated by the
jerky motion of domain walls as they interact with impurities in a soft magnet
- is a direct consequence of a magnetic domain wall's negative effective mass.
As well as providing a means of determining domain wall effective mass from a
magnet's Barkhausen noise our work suggests an inertial explanation for the
origin of avalanche asymmetries in crackling noise phenomena more generally.

high-energy electron-proton collisions at HERA and antiproton-proton collisions
at the Tevatron, with the aim of predicting new strong interaction phenomena
observable in next-generation experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Processes reviewed include inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at small
x, exclusive and diffractive processes in DIS and hadron-hadron scattering, as
well as color transparency and nuclear shadowing effects. A unified treatment
of these processes is outlined, based on factorization theorems of quantum
chromodynamics, and using the correspondence between the ""parton"" picture in
the infinite-momentum frame and the ""dipole"" picture of high-energy processes
in the target rest frame. The crucial role of the three-dimensional quark and
gluon structure of the nucleon is emphasized. A new dynamical effect predicted
at high energies is the unitarity, or black disk, limit (BDL) in the
interaction of small dipoles with hadronic matter, due to the increase of the
gluon density at small x. This effect is marginally visible in diffractive DIS
at HERA and will lead to the complete disappearance of Bjorken scaling at
higher energies. In hadron-hadron scattering at LHC energies and beyond (cosmic
ray physics), the BDL will be a standard feature of the dynamics, with
implications for (a) hadron production at forward and central rapidities in
central proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, in particular events with
heavy particle production (Higgs), (b) proton-proton elastic scattering, (c)
heavy-ion collisions. We also outline the possibilities for studies of
diffractive processes and photon-induced reactions (ultraperipheral collisions)
at LHC, as well as possible measurements with a future electron-ion collider.

mass hierarchies. A family symmetry Z_{3L} is introduced, which is the cyclic
symmetry among the three generation SU(2) doublets. SUSY breaks at a high
energy scale ~ 10^{11} GeV. The electroweak energy scale ~ 100 GeV is
unnaturally small. No additional global symmetry, like the R-parity, is
imposed. The Yukawa couplings and R-parity violating couplings all take their
natural values which are about (10^0-10^{-2}). Under the family symmetry, only
the third generation charged fermions get their masses. This family symmetry is
broken in the soft SUSY breaking terms which result in a hierarchical pattern
of the fermion masses. It turns out that for the charged leptons, the tau mass
is from the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) and the sneutrino VEVs, the
muon mass is due to the sneutrino VEVs, and the electron gains its mass due to
both Z_{3L} and SUSY breaking. The large neutrino mixing are produced with
neutralinos playing the partial role of right-handed neutrinos. |V_{e3}| which
is for nu_e-nu_{tau} mixing is expected to be about 0.1. For the quarks, the
third generation masses are from the Higgs VEVs, the second generation masses
are from quantum corrections, and the down quark mass due to the sneutrino
VEVs. It explains m_c/m_s, m_s/m_e, m_d > m_u and so on. Other aspects of the

determined by the genus zero topological partition function $F^{(0,h)}$, on a
world-sheet with $h$ boundaries. By string duality, these terms are also
related to heterotic topological amplitudes studied in the past, with the
topological twist applied only in the left-moving supersymmetric sector of the
internal $N=(2,0)$ superconformal field theory. The holomorphic anomaly of
these couplings relates them to terms of the form $\Pi^n({\rm Tr}W^2)^{h-2}$,
where $\Pi$'s represent chiral projections of non-holomorphic functions of
chiral superfields. An important property of these couplings is that they
violate R-symmetry for $h\ge 3$. As a result, once supersymmetry is broken by
D-term expectation values, $(\Tr W^2)^2$ generates gaugino masses that can be
hierarchically smaller than the scalar masses, behaving as $m_{1/2}\sim m_0^4$
in string units. Similarly, $\Pi{\rm Tr}W^2$ generates Dirac masses for
non-chiral brane fermions, of the same order of magnitude. This mechanism can
be used for instance to obtain fermion masses at the TeV scale for scalar

theories with dynamical fermions in the two index symmetric and antisymmetric
representation of the gauge group. By studying the properties of the center of
the gauge group we predict for an even number of colors a confining phase
transition, if second order, to be in the universality class of Ising in three
dimensions. This is due to the fact that the center group symmetry does not
break completely for an even number of colors. For an odd number of colors the
center group symmetry breaks completely. This pattern remains unaltered at
large number of colors. We claim that the confining/deconfining phase
transition in these theories at large N is not mapped in the one of super
Yang-Mills. We extend the Polyakov loop effective theory to describe the
confining phase transition of the theories studied here for a generic number of
colors. Our results are not modified when adding matter in the same higher
dimensional representation of the gauge group. We comment on the interplay
between confinement and chiral symmetry in these theories and suggest that they
are ideal laboratories to shed light on this issue also for ordinary QCD. We
compare the free energy as function of temperature for different theories. We
find that the conjectured thermal inequality between the infrared and
ultraviolet degrees of freedom computed using the free energy does not lead to
new constraints on asymptotically free theories with fermions in higher
dimensional representation of the gauge group.

currently known. (b) We shall present a way of using couplings to derive
concentration inequalities. Although couplings are routinely used for proving
decay of correlations, no method for using couplings to derive concentration
bounds is available in the literature. This will be used to obtain (c)
concentration inequalities with explicit constants under Dobrushin's condition
of weak dependence. (d) We shall give a method for obtaining concentration of
Haar measures using convergence rates of related random walks on groups. Using
this technique and one of the numerous available results about rates of

The set of these paths is the Reduced Path Group. It is a continuous analogue
to the group of reduced words. The signature of the path is a power series
whose coefficients are definite iterated integrals of the path. We identify the
paths with trivial signature as the tree-like paths, and prove that two paths
are in tree-like equivalence if and only if they have the same signature. In
this way, we extend Chen's theorems on the uniqueness of the sequence of
iterated integrals associated with a piecewise regular path to finite length
paths and identify the appropriate extended meaning for reparameterisation in
the general setting. It is suggestive to think of this result as a
non-commutative analogue of the result that integrable functions on the circle
are determined, up to Lebesgue null sets, by their Fourier coefficients. As a
second theme we give quantitative versions of Chen's theorem in the case of
lattice paths and paths with continuous derivative, and as a corollary derive
results on the triviality of exponential products in the tensor algebra.

outward interferometry radii by positive $r_{out} - t$ correlations that are
the result of an intensive transverse expansion. The main features of the
experimental data are reproduced: in particular, the obtained ratio of the
outward to sideward interferometry radii is less than unity and decreases with
increasing transverse momenta of pion pairs. The extracted value of the
temperature of emission from the surface of hydrodynamic tube approximately
coincides with one found at chemical freeze-out in RHIC Au+Au collisions.

cortical microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation
influences neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of
synaptic efficacy. Neuromodulation also affects ion channels and intrinsic
excitability. Methods: Synaptic efficacy modulation is an effective way to
rapidly alter network density and topology. We alter network topology and
density to measure the effect on spike synchronization. We also operate with
differently parameterized neuron models which alter the neurons intrinsic
excitability, i.e., activation function. Results: We find that (a) fast
synaptic efficacy modulation influences the amount of correlated spiking in a
network. Also, (b) synchronization in a network influences the read-out of
intrinsic properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that
differences in intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets
intrinsic properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology
can alter the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network
activity. Conclusion: We conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to
shift between a more synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous

driving forces that structure ecological communities, although the precise
mecha nisms have yet to be characterized. Here we develop a model system that
isolates phage-mediated interactions by neutralizing resource competition using
two genetically identical Bordetella bronchiseptica strains that differ only in
that one is the carrier of a phage and the other is susceptible to the phage.
We observe and quantify the competitive advantage of the bacterial strain
bearing the prophage in both invading and in resisting invasion by bacteria
susceptible to the phage, and use our measurements to develop a mathematical
model of phage-mediated competition. The model predicts, and experimental
evidence confirms, that the competitive advantage conferred by the phage
depends only on the relative phage pathology and is independent of other phage
and host parameters. This work combines experimental and mathematical
approaches to the study of phage-driven competition, and provides an
experimentally tested framework for evaluation of the effects of
pathogens/parasites on interspecific competition.

a complex adaptive system, the components of which are possible RNA structural
rearrangements (SRs) and their associated bases and base pairs. RNA bases and
base pairs engage in local stacking interactions that determine the
probabilities (or fitnesses) of possible SRs. Meanwhile, selection operates at
the level of SRs; an autonomous stochastic process periodically (i.e., from one
time step to another) selects a subset of possible SRs for realization based on
the fitnesses of the SRs. Using examples based on selected natural and
synthetic RNAs, the model is shown to qualitatively reproduce characteristic
(nonlinear) RNA folding dynamics such as the attainment by RNAs of alternative
stable states. Possible applications of the model to the analysis of properties
of fitness landscapes, and of the RNA sequence to structure mapping are
discussed.

(NH) Hamiltonians have been extensively studied and calculated in many
different fields of physics by using L^2 methods that originally have been
developed for the calculations of bound states. The existing non-Hermitian
formalism breaks down when dealing with wavepackets(WP). An open question is
how time dependent expectation values can be calculated when the Hamiltonian is
NH ? Using the F-product formalism, which was recently proposed, [J. Phys.
Chem., 107, 7181 (2003)] we calculate the time dependent expectation values of
different observable quantities for a simple well known study test case model
Hamiltonian. We carry out a comparison between these results with those
obtained from conventional(i.e., Hermitian) quantum mechanics (QM)
calculations. The remarkable agreement between these results emphasizes the
fact that in the NH-QM, unlike standard QM, there is no need to split the
entire space into two regions; i.e., the interaction region and its
surrounding. Our results open a door for a type of WP propagation calculations
within the NH-QM formalism that until now were impossible.

bath. For this, we discuss a sample of three-level atoms in ladder
configuration interacting only via the surrounding bath, and show that the
fluorescence light emitted by this system exhibits non-classical properties.
Typical realizations for such an environment are thermal baths for microwave
transition frequencies, or incoherent broadband fields for optical transitions.
In a small sample of atoms, the emitted light can be switched from sub- to
super-poissonian and from anti-bunching to super-bunching controlled by the
mean number of atoms in the sample. Larger samples allow to generate
super-bunched light over a wide range of bath parameters and thus fluorescence
light intensities. We also identify parameter ranges where the fields emitted
on the two transitions are correlated or anti-correlated, such that the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is violated. As in a moderately strong baths this
violation occurs also for larger numbers of atoms, such samples exhibit
mesoscopic quantum effects.
