state w < -1 as deduced from the supernova data. We imagine that the universe
is accelerating under the control of a quintessence field, which is moving up a
very gently sloping potential. As a result, the potential energy and hence the
acceleration increases at lower redshifts. Fitting this behavior with a dark
energy model with constant w would require w<-1. In fact we find that the
choice of parameters which improves the fit to the SNe mimics w = -1.4 at low
redshifts. Running up the potential in fact provides the best fit to the SN
data for a generic quintessence model. However, unlike models with phantoms,
our model does not have negative energies or negative norm states. Future
searches for supernovae at low redshifts 0.1 < z < 0.5 and at high redshifts
z>1 may be a useful probe of our proposal.

models incorporate a 0.5 Jupiter mass planet undergoing type II migration
through an inner protoplanet--planetesimal disk, with gas drag included. Each
model is initiated with the inner disk being at successively increased levels
of maturity, so that it is undergoing either oligarchic or giant impact style
growth as the gas giant migrates. In all cases, a large fraction of the disk
mass survives the passage of the giant, either by accreting into massive
terrestrial planets shepherded inward of the giant, or by being scattered into
external orbits. Shepherding is favored in younger disks where there is strong
dynamical friction from planetesimals and gas drag is more influential, whereas
scattering dominates in more mature disks where dissipation is weaker. In each
scenario, sufficient mass is scattered outward to provide for the eventual
accretion of a set of terrestrial planets in external orbits, including within
the system's habitable zone. An interesting result is the generation of
massive, short period, terrestrial planets from compacted material pushed ahead
of the giant. These planets are reminiscent of the short period Neptune mass
planets discovered recently, suggesting that such `hot Neptunes' could form

the interface where eta Car's ejecta meet the stellar wind of the nearby O4

this is probably the decelerated pre-outburst LBV wind of eta Car. The [O III]
morphology is very different from that seen in [N II], which traces young knots
of CNO-processed material; this represents a dramatic shift in the chemical

double default map tailored for reconstruction of asymmetric structures.
Two-armed spiral structures are clearly seen in all eclipse maps. The arms are
located at different distances from the disc centre. The ``blue'' arm is
farther out in the disc (R= 0.55 +/- 0.05 R_{L1}) than the ``red'' arm (R= 0.30
+/- 0.05 R_{L1}). There are evidences that the velocity of the emitting gas
along the spiral pattern is lower than the Keplerian velocity for the same disc
radius. The discrepancy is smaller in the outer arm (measured velocities 10-15
per cent lower than Keplerian) and is more significant in the inner arm
(observed velocities up to 40 per cent lower than Keplerian). We measured the
opening angle of the spirals from the azimuthal intensity distribution of the
eclipse maps to be \phi= 25 +/- 3 degrees. A comparison with similar
measurements on data at different outburst stages reveals that the opening
angle of the spiral arms in IP Peg decreases while the outbursting accretion
disc cools and shrinks, in agreement with the expected evolution of a tidally
driven spiral wave. The sub-Keplerian velocities along the spiral pattern and
the clear correlation between the opening angle of the spirals and the outburst
stage favors the interpretation of these asymmetric structures as
tidally-induced spiral shocks.

Spatio-kinetic properties of a broad component region traced by 12CO lines are
roughly explained by a simple spherical outflow model with a typical expanding

satellite-satellite and two-halo pairs. The peak value is reached at around
1$h^{-1}$Mpc and does not reflect the velocity dispersion of a typical halo
hosting these galaxies, but is instead dominated by the satellite-satellite
pairs in high mass clusters. This is true even for cross-correlations between

given separation can decrease with luminosity, even if the underlying typical
halo host mass is increasing, in agreement with recent observations. We compare
our findings to numerical simulations and find a good agreement. Numerical

the subhalo mass. We develop models of the auto- and cross-correlation function

bound and an upper one for this exponent in a general spanning tree with the

fraction of particles outside the condensate is vanishing. We use extreme value
statistics and an asymptotically exact strong disorder renormalization group
method to explore the properties of the steady state. In a finite system of $L$
sites the current vanishes as $J \sim L^{-z}$, where the dynamical exponent,
$z$, is exactly calculated. For $0<z<1$ the transport is realized by $N_a \sim
L^{1-z}$ active particles, which move with a constant velocity, whereas for
$z>1$ the transport is due to the anomalous diffusion of a single Brownian
particle. Inactive particles are localized at a second special site and their
number in rare realizations is macroscopic. The average density profile of
inactive particles has a width of, $\xi \sim \delta^{-2}$, in terms of the
asymmetry parameter, $\delta$. In addition to this, we have investigated the
approach to the steady state of the system through a coarsening process and
found that the size of the condensate grows as $n_L \sim t^{1/(1+z)}$ for large
times. For the unbiased model $z$ is formally infinite and the coarsening is

characterizing the energy scale of symmetry breaking. If \phi_m < \phi_cr

with both infinite and finite radii may either exponentially grow or tend to
finite constant values far from the center. All such configurations are shown
to be able to trap test scalar matter, in striking contrast to RS2 type 5D

Quantum Gravity (LQG). It is essential in order to construct Triad operators
that enter the Hamiltonian constraint and which become densely defined
operators on the full Hilbert space even though in the classical theory the
triad becomes singular when classical GR breaks down. The expression for the
volume and triad operators derives from the quantisation of the fundamental
electric flux operator of LQG by a complicated regularisation procedure. In
fact, there are two inequivalent volume operators available in the literature
and, moreover, both operators are unique only up to a finite, multiplicative
constant which should be viewed as a regularisation ambiguity. Now on the one
hand, classical volumes and triads can be expressed directly in terms of fluxes
and this fact was used to construct the corresponding volume and triad
operators. On the other hand, fluxes can be expressed in terms of triads and
therefore one can also view the volume operator as fundamental and consider the
flux operator as a derived operator. In this paper we examine whether the
volume, triad and flux quantisations are consistent with each other. The
results of this consistency analysis are rather surprising. Among other
findings we show: 1. The regularisation constant can be uniquely fixed. 2. One
of the volume operators can be ruled out as inconsistent. 3. Factor ordering
ambiguities in the definition of triad operators are immaterial for the
classical limit of the derived flux operator. The results of this paper show
that within full LQG triad operators are consistently quantized. In this paper
we present ideas and results of the consistency check. In a companion paper we
supply detailed proofs.

quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Observables (sum rules) based on the spectral
functions of hadronic tau decays can be related to QCD quark-level calculations
to determine fundamental quantities like the strong coupling constant,
parameters of the chiral Lagrangian, |V_us|, the mass of the strange quark, and
to simultaneously test the concept of quark-hadron duality. Using the best
available measurements and a revisited analysis of the theoretical framework,
the value alpha_s(m_tau) = 0.345 +- 0.004[exp] +- 0.009[theo] is obtained.
Taken together with the determination of alpha_s(m_Z) from the global
electroweak fit, this result leads to the most accurate test of asymptotic
freedom: the value of the logarithmic slope of 1/alpha_s(s) is found to agree
with QCD at a precision of 4%. In another approach, the tau spectral functions
can be used to determine hadronic quantities that, due to the nonperturbative
nature of long-distance QCD, cannot be computed from first principles. An
example for this is the contribution from hadronic vacuum polarization to
loop-dominated processes like the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This
article reviews the measurements of nonstrange and strange tau spectral
functions and their phenomenological applications.

inflaton is exponentially rapidly transfered into highly occupied
out-of-equilibrium inhomogeneous modes, which subsequently evolve towards
equilibrium. The infrared modes excited during preheating evolve towards a
saturated distribution long before thermalization completes. We compute the
equation of state during and immediately after preheating. It rapidly evolves
towards radiation domination long before the actual thermal equilibrium is
established. The exact time of this transition is a non-monotonic function of
the coupling between the inflaton and the decay products, and it varies only
very weakly (around 10^(-35) s) as this coupling changes over several orders of
magnitude. This result is applied to refine the relation between the number of
efoldings N and the physical wavelength of perturbations generated during
inflation. We also discuss the implications for the theory of modulated
perturbations from preheating. We finally argue that many questions of the
thermal history of the universe should be addressed in terms of
pre-thermalization, illustrating this point with a calculation of perturbative
production of gravitinos immediately after chaotic inflation. We also highlight
the effects of three-legs inflaton interactions on the dynamics of preheating

the rotations in the tangent bundle of the branes with ``R-symmetry'' rotations
in the normal bundle, in contrast to the ordinary spinning formulation of
topological strings, where twisting is performed with internal U(1) currents of
the N=(2,2) superconformal algebra. The double dimensional reduction on a
circle of the topological membrane gives the strings of the topological A-model
(a by-product of this reduction is a Green-Schwarz formulation of topological
strings). We conclude that the action is BRST-exact modulo topological terms
and fermionic equations of motion. We discuss the role of topological membranes
in topological M-theory and the relation of our work to recent work by Hitchin
and by Dijkgraaf et al.

that the former have the same renormalization and produce the same subsequent

to divergences that are localized at precisely the initial time hypersurface on

by adding initial-boundary counterterms, which render all of the perturbative
corrections small and finite. Initial states that approach the standard vacuum

modified due to the hidden assumptions about the Planck scale physics -- dubbed
as trans-Planckian inflation -- has received considerable attention. To mimic
the possible trans-Planckian effects, among various models, modified dispersion
relations have been popular in the literature. In almost all the earlier
analyzes, unlike the canonical scalar field driven inflation, the
trans-Planckian effects are introduced to the scalar/tensor perturbation
equations in an ad hoc manner -- without calculating the stress-tensor of the
cosmological perturbations from the covariant Lagrangian. In this work, we
perform the gauge-invariant cosmological perturbations for the single-scalar
field inflation with the Jacobson-Corley dispersion relation by computing the
fluctuations of all the fields including the unit time-like vector field which
defines a preferred rest frame. We show that: (i) The non-linear effects
introduce corrections only to the perturbed energy density. The corrections to
the energy density vanish in the super-Hubble scales. (ii) The scalar
perturbations, in general, are not purely adiabatic. (iii) The equation of
motion of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable corresponding to the inflaton field is
different than those presumed in the earlier analyzes. (iv) The tensor
perturbation equation remains unchanged. We perform the classical analysis for
the resultant system of equations and also compute the power-spectrum of the
scalar perturbations in a particular limit. We discuss the implications of our
results and compare with the earlier results.

tableaux will be useful in furthering the understanding of permutations. We
give two bijections from permutation tableaux to permutations. The first
bijection carries tableaux statistics to permutation statistics based on
relative sizes of pairs of letters in a permutation and their places. We call
these statistics weak excedance statistics, because of their close relation to
weak excedances. The second bijection carries tableaux statistics (via the weak
excedance statistics) to statistics based on generalized permutation patterns.
We then give enumerative applications of these bijections. One nice consequence

the lifted flow to the universal cover is homeomorphic to an open disk. We
compactify this orbit space with an ideal circle boundary. If there are no
perfect fits between stable and unstable leaves and the flow is not
topologically conjugate to a suspension Anosov flow, we then show: The ideal
circle of the orbit space has a natural quotient space which is a sphere and is
a dynamical systems ideal boundary for a compactification of the universal
cover of the manifold. The main result is that the fundamental group acts on
the flow ideal boundary as a uniform convergence group. Using a theorem of
Bowditch, this yields a proof that the fundamental group of the manifold is
Gromov hyperbolic and it shows that the action of the fundamental group on the
flow ideal boundary is conjugate to the action on the Gromov ideal boundary.
This implies that pseudo-Anosov flows without perfect fits are quasigeodesic
flows and we show that the stable/unstable foliations of these flows are
quasi-isometric. Finally we apply these results to foliations: if a foliation
is R-covered or with one sided branching in an atoroidal three manifold then
the results above imply that the leaves of the foliation in the universal cover
extend continuously to the sphere at infinity.

For G connected, this is still an open question. After a discussion of general

unramified Brauer group of a function field and describe the work of Saltman

the solvents and with the interface according to some charges that they carry.
The charges repeat themselves along the chain in a periodic fashion. The main
question concerning this model is whether the polymer remains tightly close to
the interface, a phenomenon called localization, or whether there is a marked
preference for one of the two solvents, thus yielding a delocalization
phenomenon. In this paper, we present an approach that yields sharp estimates
for the partition function of the model in all regimes (localized, delocalized
and critical). This, in turn, makes possible a precise pathwise description of
the polymer measure, obtaining the full scaling limits of the model. A key
point is the closeness of the polymer measure to suitable Markov renewal
processes, Markov renewal theory being one of the central mathematical tools of
our analysis.

of almost complex structure (so-called Nijenhuis tensor) maps a 3-dimensional
bundle to a 3-dimensional one. We say that Nijenhuis tensor is non-degenerate
if it is an isomorphism. An almost complex manifold is called nearly Kaehler if
it admits a Hermitian form $\omega$ such that $\nabla(\omega)$ is totally
antisymmetric, $\nabla$ being the Levi-Civita connection. We show that a nearly
Kaehler metric on a given almost complex 6-manifold with non-degenerate
Nijenhuis tensor is unique (up to a constant). We interpret the nearly Kaehler
property in terms of G_2-geometry and in terms of connections with totally
antisymmetric torsion, obtaining a number of equivalent definitions. Further
on, we construct an intrinsic diffeomorphism-invariant functional on the space
of almost complex structures on $M$, similar to the Hitchin functional, and
compute its extrema in the following important case. Consider an almost complex
structure $I$ with non-degenerate Nijenhuis tensor, admitting a Hermitian
connection with totally antisymmetric torsion. We show that the intrinsic
volume functional has an extremum in $I$ if and only if $(M,I)$ is nearly
Kaehler.

theoretically justified on a case-by-case basis. An ultimate goal is to find a
common cause for allometry of all types and for both living and nonliving
systems. The principle I - J = extrem. of Extreme physical information (EPI) is
found to provide such a cause. It describes the flow of Fisher information J =>
I from an attribute value a on the cell level to its exterior observation y.

a general allometric law f(x,a)= y = Yx^{a}. Darwinian evolution is presumed to
cause a second extremization of I - J, now with respect to the choice of a. The
solution is a=+or-n/4, n=0,1,2..., defining the particular powers of biological

sender to a distant receiver via the control of many agents in a network. We
show that the receiver can successfully restore the original state of each
qubit as long as all the agents cooperate. However, it is remarkable that for
certain type of teleported states, the receiver can not gain any amplitude
information even if one agent does not collaborate. In addition, our analysis
shows that for general input states of each message qubit, the average fidelity
for the output states, when even one agent does not take action, is the same as
that for the previous proposals.

K, this method efficiently cools very hot atoms and can sufficiently localize
trapped atoms to produce near diffraction-limited atomic images.

  oblivious remote state preparation","Ver 5: 12 pages, no figure, added result about remote state
  preparation",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Shannon in celebrated works had shown that n bits of shared key is necessary
and sufficient to transmit n-bit classical information in an
information-theoretically secure way. Ambainis, Mosca, Tapp and de Wolf in
quant-ph/0003101 considered a more general setting, referred to as Private
quantum channels, in which instead of classical information, quantum states are
required to be transmitted and only one-way communication is allowed. They show
that in this case 2n bits of shared key is necessary and sufficient to transmit
an n-qubit state. We consider the most general setting in which we allow for
all possible combinations i.e. we let the input to be transmitted, the message
sent and the shared resources to be classical/quantum. We develop a general
framework by which we are able to show tight bounds on communication/shared
resources in all of these cases and this includes the results of Shannon and
Ambainis et al.
  As a consequence of our arguments we also show that in a one-way oblivious
Remote state preparation protocol for transferring an n-qubit pure state, the
entropy of the communication must be 2n and the entanglement measure of the
shared resource must be n. This generalizes on the result of Leung and Shor
which shows same bound on the length of communication in the special case when
the shared resource is maximally entangled e.g. EPR pairs and hence settles an
open question asked in their paper regarding protocols without maximally
entangled shared resource.
