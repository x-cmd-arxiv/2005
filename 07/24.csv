fluctuations in the transmitted flux of HE2347-4342 ${\rm Ly}{\alpha}$
absorption in order to investigate if there is any discrepancy between the LCDM
model with parameters given by the WMAP and observations on small scales. If
the non-Gaussianity of cosmic mass field is assumed to come only from halos
with an universal mass profile of the LCDM model, the non-Gaussian behavior of
mass field would be effectively measured by its intermittency, because
intermittency is a basic statistical feature of the cuspy structures. We have
shown that the Ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux field of HE2347-4342 is
significantly intermittent on small scales. With the hydrodynamic simulation,
we demonstrate that the LCDM model is successful in explaining the power
spectrum and intermittency of ${\rm Ly}{\alpha}$ transmitted flux. Using
statistics ranging from the second to eighth order, we find no discrepancy
between the LCDM model and the observed transmitted flux field, and no evidence
to support the necessity of reducing the power of density perturbations
relative to the standard LCDM model up to comoving scales as small as about
$0.08 {\rm h}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$. Moreover, our simulation samples show that the
intermittent exponent of the Ly$\alpha$ transmitted flux field is probably
scale-dependent. This result is different from the prediction of universal mass
profile with a constant index of the central cusp. The scale-dependence of the
intermittent exponent indicates that the distribution of baryonic gas is
decoupled from the underlying dark matter.

sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies in XMM-Newton archival data. There appear to
be three distinct classes of spectra. One class shows emission from hot,
diffuse plasma. This thermal emission is similar to that seen from recent
supernovae; the temperatures are in the range 0.6-0.8 keV and the luminosities
are the lowest in our sample, near 10^39 erg/s. Three sources have spectra
which are strongly curved at high energies and have the highest temperatures in
our sample, 1.0-1.4 keV. These spectra are well fitted with a power-law plus
multicolor disk blackbody model with the power-law dominant at low energies or
a Comptonization model. The remainder of the sources are best fitted with a
power-law plus multicolor disk blackbody model, as is commonly used to describe
the spectra of accreting black holes. These sources have the lowest thermal
component temperatures, 0.1-0.4 keV, and extend to the highest luminosities,
above 10^40 erg/s. The temperature of the thermal component is in three
distinct ranges for the three source classes. This diversity of spectral shapes
and the fact that the sources lie in three distinct temperature ranges suggests
that the ULXs are a diverse population. Two ULXs which show state transitions
stay within a single class over the course of the transition. However, we
cannot conclude with certainty that the classes represent distinct types of
objects rather than spectral states of a single population of objects. We also
searched for timing noise from the sources and report detection of noise above
the Poisson level from five sources. In three of the sources, the power density
spectrum increases with decreasing frequency as a power-law down to the lowest
frequencies observed, below 10^-4 Hz.

While for the latter field, including its surrounding we obtain a contribution
of three percent of chemically peculiar stars detectable by Delta a photometry
(i.e. the magnetic objects of this group), the second field yields about half
of this value in good accordance with the finding for NGC 1866 (Maitzen et al.,
2001, A&A, 371, L5) the surrounding field of which has been found to exhibit a
very low value of such stars - 0.3%. Thus we are faced with the fact, that our
incipient impression about a substantially lower appearance of magnetic
chemically peculiar stars in the LMC as compared to the Galaxy continues to be
valid. Most of the photometrically identified peculiar stars (from their
historical origin denominated Ap-stars) are located in the domain of the B-type
stars. But this is a selection effect due to the limiting magnitude of our
observing conditions impeding the observation of fainter main sequence stars.
In addition to objects showing up as positive deviators in Delta a photometry
we also discuss nine stars which appear opposite the main line of normal stars,
hence are negative deviators. For most of them the interpretation as emission
stars of B-type seems to be appropriate. The statistically relevant number of
observations obtained so far in the LMC supports the view that the formation of
magnetic peculiar stars has occurred there at a significantly lower rate.

evolution of a barred disc galaxy. Unlike previous studies, we use fully
self-consistent 3D $N$-body simulations with live haloes, which are known to be
important for bar evolution. The CMC is introduced gradually, to avoid
transients. In all cases where the mass of the CMC is of the order of, or more
than, a few per cent of the mass of the disc, the strength of the bar decreases
noticeably. The amount of this decrease depends strongly on the bar type. For
the same CMC, bars with exponential surface-density profile, which formed in a
disk-dominated galaxy (MD-type bars), can be totally destroyed, while strong
bars with a flat surface-density profile, whose evolution is largely due to the
halo (MH-type bars), witness only a decrease of their strength. This decrease
occurs simultaneously from both the innermost and outermost parts of the bar.
The CMC has a stronger effect on the Fourier components of higher azimuthal
wave number $m$, leading to fatter and/or less rectangular bars. Furthermore,
the CMC changes the side-on outline from peanut-shaped to boxy or, for massive
CMCs, to elliptical. Similarly, side-on initially boxy outlines can be
destroyed. The CMC also influences the velocity dispersion profiles. Most of
the decrease of the bar strength occurs while the mass of the CMC increases and
it is accompanied by an increase of the pattern speed. In all our simulations,
the mass of the CMC necessary in order to destroy the bar is at least several
per cent of the mass of the disc. This argues that observed super-massive black
holes are not likely to destroy pre-existing bars.

suitability by performing test simulations for oscillations of rapidly rotating

Furthermore, the adopted HRC scheme has increased computational efficiency as
it avoids the costly solution of Riemann problems and has practical advantages
in the modeling of neutron star spacetimes. Namely, it allows simulations with
stiff equations of state by successfully dealing with very low-density
unphysical atmospheres. These facts not only suggest that such a HRC scheme may

also open the possibility to perform accurate magnetohydrodynamical simulations

which are induced in a nonlinear medium by an optical interference pattern,
taking into account the inherent lattice deformations at the soliton location.
We obtain exact analytical solutions and identify the key factors defining
soliton mobility, including the effects of gap merging and lattice imbalance,
underlying the differences with discrete and gap solitons in conventional
photonic structures.

distributions and their dependence on nuclear shapes and isospins in the
superheavy mass region. Different Skyrme forces were used for the calculations
with a special comparison to the experimental data in $^{208}$Pb. The
ground-state deformations, nuclear radii, neutron skin thicknesses and
$\alpha$-decay energies were also calculated. Density distributions were
discussed with the calculations of single-particle wavefunctions and shell
fillings. Calculations show that deformations have considerable effects on the
density distributions, with a detailed discussion on the $^{292}$120 nucleus.
Earlier predictions of remarkably low central density are not supported when
deformation is allowed for.

The dynamics of instantons with the gluon field is given in terms of
'classical' instanton contributions, i.e. on the same footing as tree
amplitudes in field theory. This paramaterization depends on the kinematics of
the local instanton operators and their coupling dependence. A primary
advantage of this 'classical' formulation is that the weak-strong duality and
its relations with the perturbative sector are possibly made more manifest.

recognized as heat engines. Their mechanism is applicable to the fields of
engineering, physics, chemistry, geology, and biology, in particular the origin
of life. Four kinds of sorption heat engines are distinguished depending on the
occurrence of changes in the adsorbent or adsorbate during the thermal cycle.

of system, we will examine how this state is restricted by assuming each of
these following assumptions. First, by using this reasonable assumption that
two successive measurements should be describable as one measurement. Second,
by assuming the impossibility of faster than light signaling, ""No-signaling
condition"". However, only by using these assumptions it is not possible to
obtain the usual projection postulate. Instead, by means of a simple lemma, we
will show that the density operator of system after a measurement is a linear
function of the density operator determined by the usual post-measurement
postulate. Furthermore we will show this linear function has a Kraus
representation. Finally, we will discuss about the physical meaning of this
consequence.
