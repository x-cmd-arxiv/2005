composed of thermal photons, a reversing magnetic field and a small admixture
of charged particles, with a dense Wolf-Rayet wind. A thin outer layer of
Wolf-Rayet material is entrained by the jet head; it cools and becomes
Rayleigh-Taylor unstable, thereby providing an additional source of inertia and
variability. Pair creation in the wind material, and the associated
pre-acceleration, defines a characteristic radiative compactness at the point
where the reverse shock has completed its passage back through the shell. We
argue that the prompt gamma-ray emission is triggered by this external braking,
at an optical depth ~1 to electron scattering. Torsional waves, excited by the
forced reconnection of the reversing magnetic field, carry a fluctuating
current, and are damped at high frequencies by the electrostatic acceleration
of electrons and positrons. We show that inverse Compton radiation by the
accelerated charges is stronger than their synchrotron emission, and is beamed
along the magnetic field. Thermal radiation that is advected out from the base
of the jet cools the particles. The observed relation between peak energy and
isotropic luminosity is reproduced if the blackbody seeds are generated in a
relativistic jet core that is subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities with
the Wolf-Rayet envelope. This relation is predicted to soften to E_peak ~
L_iso^{1/4} below an isotropic luminosity L_iso ~ 3x10^{50} ergs/s. The
duration of spikes in the inverse-Compton emission is narrower at higher
frequencies, in agreement with the observed relation. The transition from
prompt gamma-ray emission to afterglow can be explained by the termination of
the thermal X-ray seed and the onset of synchrotron-self-Compton emission.

that paired galaxies are much more likely to be asymmetric (R_T+R_A >= 0.13)

even more striking for strongly asymmetric (R_T+R_A >= 0.16) galaxies: 25% +/-

on the Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey of
Ellison et al (2001). We have obtained near-simultaneous B and K band
magnitudes for subset of the CORALS sample and supplemented our observations
with further measurements published in the literature. To account for
redshift-related color changes, the B-K colors are normalized using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) QSO composite. The mean normalized B-K color of the
DLA sub-sample is +0.12, whereas the mean for the no-DLA sample is -0.10; both
distributions have RMS scatters ~0.5. Neither a student's T-test nor a KS test
indicate that there is any significant difference between the two color
distributions. Based on simulations which redden the colors of QSOs with
intervening DLAs, we determine a reddening limit which corresponds to E(B-V) <
0.04 (SMC-like extinction) at 99% confidence (3 sigma), assuming that E(B-V) is
the same for all DLAs. Finally, we do not find any general correlation between
absorber properties (such as [Fe/Zn] or neutral hydrogen column density) and
B-K color. One of these two QSOs shows evidence for strong associated
absorption from X-ray observations, an alternative explanation for its very red
color. We conclude that the presence of intervening galaxies causes a minimal
reddening of the background QSO.

RV Tauri stars in group II), the third one consists of Long Period Variables
(LPVs). We detect 37 RV Tauri stars and 11 RV Tauri candidates which is one of
the largest collections of this class of stars to date. The classification
scheme is supported by Fourier decomposition of the light curves. Our data

absorption of stellar flux by TiO and VO. The spectra predicted by these models

knots show the same trend observed for normal star-forming galaxies, having a
much larger dispersion than starburst galaxies. We identify the dispersion as
due to the UV emission predominantly tracing the evolved, non-ionizing stellar
population, up to ages 50-100 Myr. While in starbursts the UV light traces the
current SFR, in NGC5194 it traces a combination of current and recent-past SFR.
Unlike the UV emission, the monochromatic 24 micron luminosity is an accurate
local SFR tracer for the HII knots in NGC5194; this suggests that the 24 micron
emission carriers are mainly heated by the young, ionizing stars. However,
preliminary results show that the ratio of the 24 micron emission to the SFR
varies by a factor of a few from galaxy to galaxy. While also correlated with
star formation, the 8 micron emission is not directly proportional to the
number of ionizing photons. This confirms earlier suggestions that the carriers

70% of the high X-ray luminosity of Lbol = 4.3 10e45 erg s-1 of this cluster is

observe one of the interaction systems where the central cluster AGN is heating
the cooling core region in a self-regulated way to prevent a massive cooling of

results on the relative abundances of several heavy elements show that the high
central abundances are mostly due to the contribution from supernovae type Ia.
The dominant source is the stellar population of the central cluster galaxy.
With this identification of the origin of heavy elements and the observed rates
of SN Ia in elliptical galaxies, the central abundance peak can be used as a
diagnostic for the history of the cluster core region. We find for four nearby
cooling core clusters that the enrichment times for the central peaks are
larger than 6 - 10 Gyrs even for a higher SN Ia rate in the past. This points
to an old age and a relatively quiet history of these cluster core regions. A
detailed analysis of the element abundance ratios provides evidence that the SN
Ia yields in the central cluster galaxies are more rich in intermediate mass
elements, like Si and S, compared to the SN Ia models used to explain the heavy
element enrichment in our Galaxy.

study the kinematics in the nuclear region with a 0.1"" spatial resolution. The
STIS data and the VLT/ISAAC spectra by Marconi et al. (2001) provide
independent and consistent measures of the BH mass, which are in agreement with
our previous estimate based on the ISAAC data alone: MBH=(1.1+/-0.1) 10^8 Msun
for a disk inclination of i=25deg or or MBH=(6.5+/-0.7) 10^7 Msun for i=35deg,
the largest i value allowed by the data. We find that the choice of the
intrinsic surface brightness distribution, a crucial element in the modeling,
has no effects on MBH but has a large impact on the gas velocity dispersion. A
mismatch between the observed and model velocity dispersion is not necessarily
an indication of non-circular motions or kinematically hot gas, but is as
easily due to an inaccurate computation arising from too course a model grid,
or the adoption of an intrinsic brightness distribution which is too smooth.
The observed velocity dispersion, line profiles and the higher order moments in
the Hermite expansion, h_3 and h_4, are consistent with emission from a
rotating disk. Results from gas kinematical estimate are in good agreement with
a recent stellar dynamical estimate of MBH. The BH mass in Centaurus A agrees
with the correlation with infrared luminosity and mass of the host spheroid but
is not in disagreement with the stellar velocity dispersion if one takes into
account the intrinsic scatter of the MBH-sigma correlation. Finally, using HST
data we can constrain the size of any cluster of dark objects alternative to a
BH to r<0.035"" (~0.6pc). Thus Centaurus A ranks among the best cases for
supermassive Black Holes in galactic nuclei. (ABRIDGED)

as arising from a narrow rotating starburst ring of radius 22 pc enclosing a
mass of 7 x 10^6 Msun. We show how both the compact and apparently diffuse
maser emission from this ring can arise from a single phase of unsaturated
maser clouds amplifying background radio continuum. The masing clouds are
estimated to have a diameter of <0.7 pc and internal velocity dispersion of
about 20 km/s. We find that the clouds are neither self-gravitating nor
pressure confined but are freely expanding. Their dispersal lifetimes may set
the vertical thickness of the ring. For an estimated internal density of 3 x
10^3 cm^-3, cloud masses are of order 24 Msun. The observed spectral features
and velocity gradients indicate that the clouds must be outflowing and escaping
the nucleus. The cloud mass outflow rate is estimated to be 0.8 Msun/yr, while
the star formation rate is about 19 Msun/yr. Associated ionised gas, possibly
generated from dissipated clouds, provides free-free absorption along the
source axis, explaining the observed East-West asymmetries. We show that the
clumpiness of a maser medium can have a dramatic effect on what is observed
even in a relatively low gain OH megamaser. Specifically, in IIIZw35 our clumpy
maser model naturally explains the large line to continuum ratios, the large
1667MHz:1665MHz line ratios and the wide velocity dispersions seen in the
compact maser spots. Other astrophysical masers showing both compact and
apparently diffuse emission might be explained by similar clumpy structures.

attributed to two physical mechanisms: the large entropy of lattice phonons

quality. As a first step to address this problem, we introduce a new
AS-topology discovery methodology that results in more complete and accurate
graphs. Moreover, we use data available from existing measurement facilities,
circumventing the burden of additional measurement infrastructure. We deploy
our methodology and construct an AS-topology that has at least 61.5% more
AS-links than BTD-derived AS-topologies we examined. Finally, we analyze the

precise observations of the lunar orbit that contribute to a wide range of
science investigations. Time series of the highly accurate measurements of the
distance between the Earth and Moon provide unique information used to
determine whether, in accordance with the Equivalence Principle (EP), both of
these celestial bodies are falling towards the Sun at the same rate, despite
their different masses, compositions, and gravitational self-energies. Current
LLR solutions give $(-1.0 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-13}$ for any possible inequality
in the ratios of the gravitational and inertial masses for the Earth and Moon,
$\Delta(M_G/M_I)$. This result, in combination with laboratory experiments on
the weak equivalence principle, yields a strong equivalence principle (SEP)
test of $\Delta(M_G/M_I)_{\tt SEP} = (-2.0 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{-13}$. Such an
accurate result allows other tests of gravitational theories. The result of the
SEP test translates into a value for the corresponding SEP violation parameter
$\eta$ of $(4.4 \pm 4.5)\times10^{-4}$, where $\eta = 4\beta -\gamma -3$ and
both $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters. The
PPN parameter $\beta$ is determined to be $\beta - 1 = (1.2 \pm 1.1) \times
10^{-4}$. Focusing on the tests of the EP, we discuss the existing data, and
characterize the modeling and data analysis techniques. The robustness of the
LLR solutions is demonstrated with several different approaches that are
presented in the text. We emphasize that near-term improvements in the LLR
ranging accuracy will further advance the research of relativistic gravity in
the solar system, and, most notably, will continue to provide highly accurate
tests of the Equivalence Principle.

perturbatively for $L$ greater than but close to $L_{c}$. Including the

fermionic contributions cancel the singular part of the bosonic contributions
at L=0. Then the total quantum correction has a minimum at the critical length

In particular, we show that a spin system preserves measures satisfying the FKG
lattice condition (essentially) if and only if distinct spins flip
independently. The downward FKG property, which has been useful recently in the
study of the contact process, lies between the properties of lattice FKG and
association. We prove that this property is preserved by a spin system if the
death rates are constant and the birth rates are additive (e.g., the contact
process), and prove a partial converse to this statement. Finally, we introduce
a new property, which we call downward conditional association, which lies
between the FKG lattice condition and downward FKG, and find essentially
necessary and sufficient conditions for this property to be preserved by a spin
system. This suggests that the latter property may be more natural than the
downward FKG property.

well over the entire energy range of available data by considering $S_{11}$,

our analysis yields mass values compatible with those advocated by the Particle
Data Group. We emphasize, however, that cross-section data alone are unable to
pin down the resonance parameters and it is shown that the beam and/or target
asymmetries impose more stringent constraints on these parameter values. It is
found that the nucleonic current is relatively small and that the

RHIC, is commonly interpreted as due to parton energy loss. In high energy
nuclear collisions, QCD jets would deposit a large fraction of their energy and
into the produced matter. The question of how this energy is degraded and
whether we can use this phenomenon to probe the properties of the produced
matter is now under active discussion. It has been proposed that if this
matter, which is now being referred to as a {\em strongly coupled Quark-Gluon
Plasma} (sQGP), may behave as a liquid with a very small viscosity.
  In this case, a very specific collective excitation should be produced,
called the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the sonic booms generated by the
shock waves produced by supersonic planes. The RHIC experiments seem indeed to
be obtaining some indication that the production of particles emitted opposite
to a high-$p_t$ jet may actually be peaked away from the quenched jet
direction, at an angle roughly consistent with the direction expected in case a
shock wave is produced (i.e. orthogonal to the Mach cone). In this note we
speculate that for tagged heavy-quark jets one may observe a shrinkage of the
Mach cone at moderate $p_t$. The experimental observation of such an effect
would be a very good test for the validity of the whole picture currently
emerging from the study of partonic matter in nuclear collisions.

(QND) measurement of the polarization of a single photon--a photonic
qubit--using linear optics and photodetection. The scheme works with nonunit
probability, but success is heralded by the detection of a single photon in the
meter output. We provided an experimental demonstration of this scheme and
introduced three universally applicable fidelity measures--the measurement
fidelity F_M, the quantum state preparation fidelity F_QSP, and the QND
fidelity F_QND--to quantify its performance. The claim of Kok and Munro in
their Comment [quant-ph/0406120] is that one of our fidelity measures F_M is
not appropriate because it relies on coincidence measurements. We show why this
claim is wrong from both a fundamental and an operational perspective.

Revised version based on referee reports","Proceedings of FSTTCS05, LNCS vol. 3821, 0544c, 2005",,,"quant-ph",,"  We construct a formal framework for investigating epistemic and temporal
notions in the context of distributed quantum computation. While we rely on
structures developed earlier, we stress that our notion of quantum knowledge
makes sense more generally in any agent-based model for distributed quantum
systems. Several arguments are given to support our view that an agent's
possibility relation should not be based on the reduced density matrix, but
rather on local classical states and local quantum operations. In this way, we
are able to analyse distributed primitives such as superdense coding and
teleportation, obtaining interesting conclusions as to how the knowledge of
individual agents evolves. We show explicitly that the knowledge transfer in
teleportation is essentially classical, in that eventually, the receiving agent
knows that its state is equal to the initial state of the sender. The relevant
epistemic statements for teleportation deal with this correlation rather than
with the actual quantum state, which is unknown throughout the protocol.

triple-well trap in a three-level approximation. The inter-atomic interactions
are taken into account in a mean-field approximation (Gross-Pitaevskii
equation), leading to a nonlinear three-level model. New eigenstates emerge due
to the nonlinearity, depending on the system parameters. Adiabaticity breaks
down if such a nonlinear eigenstate disappears when the parameters are varied.
The dynamical implications of this loss of adiabaticity are analyzed for two
important special cases: A three level Landau-Zener model and the STIRAP
scheme. We discuss the emergence of looped levels for an equal-slope
Landau-Zener model. The Zener tunneling probability does not tend to zero in
the adiabatic limit and shows pronounced oscillations as a function of the
velocity of the parameter variation. Furthermore we generalize the STIRAP
scheme for adiabatic coherent population transfer between atomic states to the
nonlinear case. It is shown that STIRAP breaks down if the nonlinearity exceeds
the detuning.
