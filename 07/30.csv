between UHECR directions and those of x-ray clusters. We find an
excess-above-random of high energy cosmic rays which correlate with massive
galaxy cluster positions. For cosmic rays with energies above 50 EeV the
observed correlation is the strongest or angles of 1.2-1.6 degrees where it has
a chance probability of about 0.1%.
  Including lower energy cosmic rays in the sample causes the angle where the
most significant correlation is found to increase, as would be expected by

  These results suggest that some UHECR are produced in galaxy clusters, or in

the hypothesis that the burst should be surrounded by an interstellar medium

variations across the SNR are investigated based on high-angular resolution

extended arms associated with this SNR, show a clear indication of spectral
steepening when moving outwards from the central nebula, with variations of up
to - 0.9. However, while the spectral steepening is smooth along the eastern
arm, the northern and soutwestern arms include locally flatter structures,
which in all cases coincide with radio, IR, and optical emission enhancements.
We interpret this spectral property as the result of the combination of two
different particle populations: aging relativistic electrons injected by PSR
B1951+32 and particles accelerated at the sites where the SNR shock front
encounters interstellar gas inhomogeneities. Concerning the central nebula, the
angular resolution of the available database does not permit a detailed

rotation rates of classical Be stars. The rapid rotation of Be stars is likely
to be linked to the ejection of gas that forms dense circumstellar disks. The
physical origins of these disks are not understood, though it is generally
believed that the ability to spin up matter into a Keplerian disk depends on
how close the stellar rotation speed is to the critical speed at which the
centrifugal force cancels gravity. There has been recent disagreement between
the traditional idea that Be stars rotate between 50 and 80 percent of their
critical speeds and new ideas (inspired by the tendency for gravity darkening
to mask rapid rotation at the equator) that their rotation may be very nearly
critical. This paper utilizes Monte Carlo forward modeling to simulate
distributions of the projected rotation speed (v sin i), taking into account
gravity darkening, limb darkening, and observational uncertainties. A
chi-squared minimization procedure was used to find the distribution parameters
that best reproduce observed v sin i distributions from R. Yudin's database.
Early-type (O7e-B2e) Be stars were found to exhibit a roughly uniform spread of
intrinsic rotation speed that extends from 40 to 60 percent up to 100 percent
of critical. Late-type (B3e-A0e) Be stars exhibit progressively narrower ranges
of rotation speed as the effective temperature decreases; the lower limit rises
to reach critical rotation for the coolest Be stars. The derived lower limits
on equatorial rotation speed represent conservative threshold rotation rates
for the onset of the Be phenomenon. The significantly subcritical speeds found
for early-type Be stars represent strong constraints on physical models of
angular momentum deposition in Be star disks.

stellar mass, stellar age, dust reddening, and star-formation rate; and (4) to
assess how representative the GOODS survey is at this epoch. Our simulations
predict that high-redshift galaxies show strong correlations in star formation
rate versus stellar mass, and weaker correlations versus environment and age,
such that GOODS galaxies are predicted to be the most massive, most rapidly
star-forming galaxies at that epoch, living preferentially in dense regions.
The simulated rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) and integrated luminosity
density are in broad agreement with observations at z~4. The predicted
rest-frame optical (observed 3.6 micron) LF is similar to the rest-frame UV LF,
shifted roughly one magnitude brighter. We predict that GOODS detects less than
50% of the total stellar mass density formed in galaxies more massive than
10^8.7 M_sun by z=4, mainly because of brightness limits in the HST/ACS bands.
The most rapidly star forming galaxies in our simulations have rates exceeding
1000 M_sun yr^-1, similar to observed sub-mm galaxies. The star formation rates
of these galaxies show at most a mild excess (2--3x) over the rates that would
be expected for their stellar mass. Whether these bright galaxies would be
observable as LBGs depends on the uncertain effects of dust reddening.

qualitatively consistent with this cluster's larger [Fe/H] (and perhaps
slightly larger age). However, quantitative comparison with standard stellar

cluster (GC) systems of 53 ellipticals in the Virgo Cluster, spanning massive
galaxies to dEs. Among the new results are: (1) In the gEs M87 and NGC 4649,
there is a correlation between luminosity and color for individual metal-poor
GCs, such that more massive GCs are more metal-rich. A plausible interpretation
of this result is self-enrichment, and may suggest that these GCs once
possessed dark matter halos. (2) Many dEs have metal-rich GC subpopulations. We
also confirm the GC color--galaxy luminosity relations found previously for
both metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations. (3) There are large
differences in GC specific frequency among dEs. Over -15 < M_B < -18, there is
little correlation between specific frequency (S_N)and M_B. But we do find
evidence for two separate S_N classes of dEs: those with B-band S_N ~ 2, and
others with populous GC systems that have S_N ranging from ~ 5-20 with median
S_N ~ 10. Together, these points suggest multiple formation channels for dEs in
Virgo. (4) The peak of the GC luminosity function (GCLF) is the same for both
gEs and dEs. This is contrary to expectations of dynamical friction on massive
GCs, unless the primordial GCLF varies between gEs and dEs. Among gEs the GCLF
turnover varies by a surprising small 0.05 mag, an encouraging result for its
use as an accurate standard candle. (5) dE,Ns appear bimodal in their nuclear
properties: there are small bright red nuclei consistent with formation by
dynamical friction of GCs, and larger faint blue nuclei which appear to have
formed by a dissipative process with little contribution from GCs. The role of
dynamical evolution in shaping the present-day properties of dE GC systems and
their nuclei remains ambiguous. (Abridged)

late-type Hipparcos stars), but its metallicity is 0.1 dex higher than the most
recent estimate of this group's metallicity. While certainly ``solar-type''
stars, HIP 76114 and 77718 are a few percent less massive, significantly older,
and metal-poor compared to the Sun; they are neither good solar twin candidates
nor solar analogs providing a look at the Sun at some other point in its
evolution. HIP 71813 appears to be an excellent solar analog of age 8 Gyr. Our
results for HIP 78399 suggest the promise of this star as a solar twin may be
equivalent to the ``closest ever solar twin'' HR 6060; follow up study of this
star is encouraged.

possible ejections of BHs and their progenitors from clusters because of natal
kicks imparted by supernovae and recoil following binary disruptions. The
results indicate that the properties of both retained BHs in clusters and
ejected BHs (forming a field population) depend sensitively on the depth of the
cluster potential. In particular, most BHs ejected from binaries are also
ejected from clusters with central escape speeds Vesc < 100 km/s. Conversely,
most BHs remaining in binaries are retained by clusters with Vesc > 50 km/s.
BHs from single star evolution are also affected significantly: about half of
the BHs originating from primordial single stars are ejected from clusters with
Vesc < 50 km/s. Our results lay a foundation for theoretical studies of the
formation of BH X-ray binaries in and around star clusters, including possible
ultra-luminous sources, as well as merging BH--BH binaries detectable with

arrived main sequence stars of solar-like mass (0.4-1.2 M_sun) in five nearby
young clusters: the Orion Nebula Cluster, NGC 2264, alpha Per, IC 2602 and the
Pleiades. In combination with estimates of stellar radii these data allow us to
construct distributions of surface angular momentum per unit mass at three
different epochs: nominally, 1, 2 and 50 My. Our main result is illustrated in
Fig. 18 and may be summarized as follows: (1) 50-60% of the stars on convective
tracks in this mass range are released from any locking mechanism very early on
and are free to conserve angular momentum throughout most of their PMS
evolution, i.e. to spin up and account for the rapidly rotating young main
sequence stars. (2) The other 40-50% lose substantial amounts of angular
momentum during the first few million years, and end up as slowly rotating main
sequence stars. The duration of the rapid angular momentum loss phase is ~5-6
My, which is roughly consistent with the lifetimes of disks estimated from
infrared surveys of young clusters. The rapid rotators of Orion age lose less
than 10% of their (surface) specific angular momentum during the next 50 My
while the slow rotators lose about two-thirds of theirs. A detectable part of
this loss occurs even during the ~1 My interval between the ONC and NGC 2264.
The data support the view that interaction between an accretion disk and star
is the primary mechanism for evolving the broad, bimodal distribution of
rotation rates seen for solar-like stars in the ONC into the even broader
distributions seen in the young MS clusters.

2005 and was the first Gamma-Ray Burst to be observed by both Swift and

afterglows ever observed. The spacecraft could not slew immediately to the
burst, so the first X-ray and optical observations occurred approximately 45
minutes after the trigger. Although no optical emission was found by any
instrument, both Swift and XMM-Newton detected the fading X-ray afterglow.
Combined data from both of these observatories show the afterglow to be fading
monotonically as 0.99 +0.15/-0.12 over a time frame between 45 minutes to 27
hours post-burst. Spectral analysis, allowed largely by the higher through-put
of XMM-Newton, implies a power-law with a slope of Gamma=1.75 +0.19/-0.18 and
shows no evidence for absorption above the Galactic column of 7 x 10^20 cm^-2.
  From the X-ray decay and spectral slopes, a low electron power-law index of p
= 1.3-1.9 is derived; the slopes also imply that a jet-break has not occured up
to 27 hours after the burst. The faintness of GRB050223 may be due to a large

nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/T1T is enhanced
on approaching the metamagnetic critical field of 7.9 T and at the critical
field 1/T1T continues to increase and does not show Fermi- liquid behavior down
to 0.3 K. The temperature dependence of T1T in this region suggests the
critical temperature Theta to be 0 K, which is a strong evidence that the spin
dynamics possesses a quantum critical character. Comparison between uniform
susceptibility and 1/T1T reveals that antiferromagnetic fluctuations instead of
two-dimensional ferromagnetic fluctuations dominate the spin fluctuation
spectrum at the critical field, which is unexpected for itinerant
metamagnetism.

allowed the simulation of dynamical systems through a large set of interacting
agents. This is a bottom-up approach which tries to derive global properties of
a complex system through local interaction rules and agent behaviour.
Traditionally, such systems are modeled and simulated through top-down methods
based on differential equations. Agent-Based Modeling has the advantage of
simplicity and low computational cost. However, unlike differential equations,
there is no standard way to express agent behaviour. Besides, it is not clear
how to analytically predict the results obtained by the simulation. In this
paper we survey some of these methods. For expressing agent behaviour formal
methods, like Stochastic Process Algebras have been used. Such approach is
useful if the global properties of interest can be expressed as a function of
stochastic time series. However, if space variables must be considered, we
shall change the focus. In this case, multiscale techniques, based on
Chapman-Enskog expansion, was used to establish the connection between the
microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic observables. Also, we use data mining
techniques,like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to study agent systems like
Cellular Automata. With the help of these tools we will discuss a simple
society model, a Lattice Gas Automaton for fluid modeling, and knowledge
discovery in CA databases. Besides, we show the capabilities of the NetLogo, a

extremely sensitive to modifications in the Hamiltonian that dictates the time

with the appropriate generalized Higgs mechanism. By assembling these into
supermultiplets we compute the same coefficients for general supergravity
theories, and show that they vanish for many examples. One of the steps of the
calculation involves computing these coefficients for massless particles, and
our expressions in this case agree with -- and extend to more general
background spacetimes -- earlier calculations, where these exist. Our results
give that part of the low-energy effective action which depends most
sensitively on the mass of heavy fields once these are integrated out. These
results are used in hep-th/0504004 to compute the sensitivity to large masses
of the Casimir energy in Ricci-flat 4D compactifications of 6D supergravity.

step-function potentials in a 3+1 dimensional spherical geometry is considered.
The potential is chosen to be zero except in a shell of thickness $\delta$,
where it has height $h$, with the constraint $h\delta=1$. In the limit of zero
thickness, an ideal $\delta$-function shell is recovered. The behavior of the
energy density as the surface of the shell is approached is studied in both the
strong and weak coupling regimes. The former case corresponds to the well-known
Dirichlet shell limit. New results, which shed light on the nature of surface
divergences and on the energy contained within the shell, are obtained in the
weak coupling limit, and for a shell of finite thickness. In the case of zero
thickness, the energy has a contribution not only from the local energy
density, but from an energy term residing entirely on the surface. It is shown
that the latter coincides with the integrated local energy density within the
shell. We also study the dependence of local and global quantities on the
conformal parameter. In particular new insight is provided on the reason for
the divergence in the global Casimir energy in third order in the coupling.

Lyapunov exponent approach suitable to cellular automata and other discrete
spatial systems. The other, local statistical complexity filtering, calculates
the amount of information needed for optimal prediction of the system's
behavior in the vicinity of a given point. By examining the changing
spatiotemporal distributions of these quantities, we can find the coherent
structures in a variety of pattern-forming cellular automata, without needing
to guess or postulate the form of that structure. We apply both filters to
elementary and cyclical cellular automata (ECA and CCA) and find that they
readily identify particles, domains and other more complicated structures. We
compare the results from ECA with earlier ones based upon the theory of formal
languages, and the results from CCA with a more traditional approach based on
an order parameter and free energy. While sensitivity and statistical
complexity are equally adept at uncovering structure, they are based on
different system properties (dynamical and probabilistic, respectively), and
provide complementary information.

  in Biomedical Engineering",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM",,"  We present a method for the real time prediction of punctate events in neural
activity, based on the time-frequency spectrum of the signal, applicable both
to continuous processes like local field potentials (LFP) as well as to spike
trains. We test it on recordings of LFP and spiking activity acquired
previously from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of macaque monkeys
performing a memory-saccade task. In contrast to earlier work, where trials
with known start times were classified, our method detects and classifies
trials directly from the data. It provides a means to quantitatively compare
and contrast the content of LFP signals and spike trains: we find that the
detector performance based on the LFP matches the performance based on spike
rates. The method should find application in the development of neural
prosthetics based on the LFP signal. Our approach uses a new feature vector,
which we call the 2D cepstrum.

the activity of molecular motors. Many of the key players at the origin of the
forces generating the movement have been identified, but their spatial and
temporal organization remains elusive. The protein complex Kinetochore on the
chromosome associates with microtubules emanating from one of the spindle poles
and drives the chromosome toward the pole. Chromokinesin motors on the
chromosome arms also interact with microtubules, ejecting the chromosome away
from the pole. In animal cells, a monooriented chromosome (associated to a
single pole) periodically switches between phases of poleward and away from the
pole movement[, a behavior tentatively explained so far by the existence of a
complex switching mechanism within the kinetochore itself. Here we show that
the interplay between the morphology of the mitotic spindle and the collective
kinetics of chromokinesins can account for the highly non-linear periodic
chromosome motion. Our analysis provides a natural explanation for the origin
of chromosome directional instability and for the mechanism by which
chromosomes feel their position in space.

one-mode fermionic attenuation channels. An explicit formula for the classical
capacity $C_1$ and for the minimum output entropy $S_{min}$ of these channels
is proposed. We compute $S_{min}$ analytically for any number of qubits under
assumption that the minimum is achieved on a Gaussian input. Apart from that, a
simple numerical method for evaluating $S_{min}$ is developed. The method is
applicable to any channels that are sufficiently noisy. For fermionic product
channels the proposed formula for $S_{min}$ agrees with the numerical results
with a precision about $10^{-9}$.

simple family of three-partite pure states, superpositions of
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and singlets. Despite the simplicity of the
states, we show that they cannot be reversibly concentrated by the standard
entanglement concentration procedure, to which they seem ideally suited. Our
results cast doubt on the idea that for each N there might be a finite set of
N-party states into which any pure state can be reversibly transformed. We
further relate our results to the concept of locking of entanglement of
formation.

paper, we show that all the deterministic and direct two-way quantum
communication protocols, sometimes called ping-pong (PP) protocols, are
insecure when an eavesdropper uses the invisible photon to eavesdrop on the
communication. With our invisible photon eavesdropping (IPE) scheme, the
eavesdropper can obtain full information of the communication with zero risk of
being detected. We show that this IPE scheme can be implemented experimentally
with current technology. Finally, a possible improvement of PP communication
protocols security is proposed. PACS:03.67.Hk
