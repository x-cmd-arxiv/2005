temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using multifrequency
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations. We have simulated a catalog of clusters of
galaxies detected through their SZ signature assuming the sensitivities that
will be achieved by the {\it Planck} satellite at 100, 143 and 353 GHz, taking
into account the instrumental noise and the contamination from the Cosmic
Infrared Background and from unresolved radiosources. We have parametrized the
cosmological temperature-redshift law as $T\propto (1+z)^{(1-a)}$. Using two
sets of SZ flux density ratios (100/143 GHz, which is most sensitive to the
parametrization of the $T-z$ law, and 143/353 GHz, which is most sensitive to
the peculiar velocities of the clusters) we show that it is possible to recover
the $T-z$ law assuming that the temperatures and redshifts of the clusters are
known. From a simulated catalog of $\sim 1200$ clusters, the parameter $a$ can
be recovered to an accuracy of 10$^{-2}$. Sensitive SZ observations thus appear
as a potentially useful tool to test the standard law. Most cosmological models
predict a linear variation of the CMB temperature with redshift. The discovery
of an alternative law would have profound implications on the cosmological
model, implying creation of energy in a manner that would still maintain the
black-body shape of the CMB spectrum at redshift zero.

ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) which host an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) embedded in a strong starburst (SFR > 100 M_sun/yr) by studying a sample
of 26 Seyfert ULIRGs in NaI D. The infrared luminosity of these galaxies is
powered jointly by the AGN and starburst. We find that there are hints of the
influence of the AGN on outflows in Seyfert 2/starburst composites, but the
evidence is not yet statistically conclusive. The evidence we find is lower
wind detection rates (i.e., wind opening angles) in Seyfert 2 ULIRGs than in
galaxies of comparable L_IR, higher velocities than in galaxies of comparable
SFR, and correlations between the neutral gas and the ionized gas in the
extended narrow-line region. Though the AGN probably contributes to the
outflows in Seyfert 2 ULIRGs, its momentum and energy injection is equal to or
less than that of the starburst. Similarly, the outflow mechanical luminosity
(energy outflow rate) per unit radiative luminosity is the same for starburst
and Seyfert 2 ULIRGs. In the nuclei of Seyfert 1s, we observe small-scale
outflows that are powered solely by the AGN. However, in Mrk~231, we observe
both a high-velocity, small-scale and low-velocity, extended outflow. The
latter may be powered by a starburst or radio jet. These large-scale,
lower-velocity outflows certainly exist in other Seyfert 1 ULIRGs, but they are
washed out by the light of the nucleus.

detections of point-like X-ray sources in the field is provided; a substantial
fraction of them are likely stellar objects in the Milky Way due to the low
Galactic latitude location of IC 10. The brightest source in the IC 10 field,
X-1, shows a large variation by a factor of up to $\sim 6$ on time scales
during the XMM-Newton observation. The X-ray spectra of the source indicate the
presence of a multi-color blackbody accretion disk with an inner disk
temperature T_{in} \approx 1.1 keV. These results are consistent with the
interpretation of the source as a stellar mass black hole, probably accreting
from a Wolf-Rayet star companion. We infer the mass of this black hole to be
about 4 Msun if it is not spinning, or a factor of up to about 6 higher if
there is significant spinning. We also detect an apparent diffuse soft X-ray
emission component of IC 10. An effective method is devised to remove the X-ray
CCD-readout streaks of X-1 that strongly affect the study of the diffuse
component in the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. We find that the diffuse
X-ray morphology is oriented along the optical body of the galaxy and is
chiefly associated with starburst regions. The diffuse component can be
characterized by an optically thin thermal plasma with a mean temperature of
$\sim 4 \times 10^6$ K and a 0.5-2 keV luminosity of $\sim 8 \times 10^{37}
{\rm erg s^{-1}}$, representing only a small fraction of the expected
mechanical energy inputs from massive stars in the galaxy. There is evidence
that the hot gas is driving outflows from the starburst regions; therefore, the
bulk of the energy inputs may be released in a galactic wind.

probably originate from different progenitors. For sample 3, for the two time
intervals, the KS probability is 5.35828E-5, which suggests that the hardness
ratios in different time intervals for long bursts are also different.

no exponentially growing eigenmodes in a hydrodynamic disk, because of the
non-normal nature of the eigenmodes, a large transient growth in the energy is
still possible, which may enable the system to switch to a turbulent state. For
a Keplerian disk, we estimate that the energy will grow by a factor of 1000 for

very similar to the two others reported from the direction of this source in
2001. The unambiguous identification of 1E 1048.1-5937 as the burster here
confirms it was the origin of the 2001 bursts as well. The epoch of the burst
peak was very close to the arrival time of 1E 1048.1-5937's pulse peak. The
burst exhibited significant spectral evolution with the trend going from hard
to soft. During the 11 days following the burst, the AXP was observed further
with RXTE, XMM-Newton and Chandra. Pre- and post-burst observations revealed no
change in the total flux or spectrum of the quiescent emission. Comparing all
three bursts detected thus far from this source we find that this event was the
most fluent (>3.3x10^-8 erg/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), had the highest peak
flux (59+/-9x10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 2-20 keV band), and the longest duration

preferentially at pulse maximum, have fast-rises and long X-tails containing
the majority of the total burst energy have been seen uniquely from AXPs. The

this regime the dust temperature is significantly lower (T is about 60 K) than
in the case of bright 6.7-GHz masers (T>150 K). The narrow spectral feature at
-1.1 km/s has a brightness temperature greater than about 1400 K, which
suggests that it is probably a maser. It emanates from the Orion South region

10' north from the central pulsar PSR B1509-58, and it has been suggested that
the nebula is irradiated by the pulsar jet. We performed a spectral analysis of
the seven brightest emitting regions aligned in a ``horse-shoe'' shape, and
found that the temperature of the knots increases along the ``horse-shoe'' in
the clockwise direction, while, in contrast, the ionization parameter
decreases. This strongly supports a picture of energy transfer via the
precessing pulsar jet. We examined the energy budget assuming that RCW89 is
powered by the pulsar jet, and confirmed that the pulsar rotational energy loss
is sufficient to drive the nebula. The rate of energy injection into RCW89 by
the jet was estimated from the synchrotron radiation flux. We obtained a
heating time-scale of 1400 yr, which is consistent with the pulsar
characteristic age of 1700 yr. To explain the temperature gradient, we discuss
the cooling process for plasma clouds in RCW89. We argue that the plasma clouds
can be cooled down by the adiabatic expansion within 70 yr, and form the
temperature gradient reflecting the sequential heating by the precessing pulsar
jet. We also determined the velocities of the individual plasma clouds by
spectral fitting. The plasma clouds in RCW89 are moving away at 240 ~ 860 km/s,
which constrains the inclination angle of the pulsar spin axis i > 50 degree

This provides the controlled method of studying vortex reconnections in atomic

emitted outwards as sound and transformed to surface excitations. As another

in the metallic region in the Ni substituted samples shows a T2 dependence,
which is qualitatively different from that observed in the pristine sample. The
evolution of the Fano asymmetry parameter, extracted by analyzing the lineshape
of the IR active in-plane Co-O mode, both as a function of Ni concentration and
temperature corroborates the occurrence of the MIT. It is argued that the
progressive substitution of the Co4+ ions with Ni increases the probability of
double occupancy and therefore the on-site Coulomb interaction energy leading
to a shift in the thermodynamically driven MIT to higher temperatures.

distance between the donor and the acceptor is varied by increasing the number
of bridged atoms and rate of electron transfer, k$_{et}$ is studied for a
series of different donors, D=NH$_2$, SH, OH, and a fixed acceptor, A=NO$_2$.
We observe a large k$_{et}$ even at a very large D-A separation of $\sim$ 45
$\AA$, unexpected from the well-known and standard theories like the Forster
theory. Such a long range electron transfer is due to the strong
electron-electron interactions in the bridged orbitals that result in
deconfinment of electrons in donor orbitals. Calculations at various levels:
semi-empirical and many-body exact, have been performed to accurately account
for such correlations.

gas, are expressed in terms of power laws of the temperature. The reduction of
an ideal generalized gas to an ideal classical case occurs when the
characteristic empirical temperature exponents in the thermal equation of state
and in the absolute temperature coincide in contrast to the merger of an ideal
quantum gas with an ideal classical gas in the high temperature limit. A
corollary to Carnot's theorem is proved asserting that the ratio of the work
done over a cycle to the heat absorbed to increase the temperature at constant
volume is the same for all bodies at the same volume. As power means, the
energy and entropy are incomparable and a new adiabatic potential is introduced
by showing that the volume raised to a characteristic exponent is also the
integrating factor for the quantity of heat so that the second law can be based
on the property that power means are monotonically increasing functions of
their order.

while in an entropy equilibrium the final state will be one of minimum $L$. A
metric space is connected with the power means, and the distance between means
of different order is related to the Carnot efficiency. In the ideal classical
gas limit, the average change in the entropy is shown to be proportional to the
difference between the Shannon and R\'enyi entropies for nonextensive systems
that are multifractal in nature. The $L$-potential, like the internal energy,
is a Schur convex function of the empirical temperature, which satisfies
Jensen's inequality, and serves as a measure of the tendency to uniformity in
processes involving pure thermal conduction.

linear sum rule to reproduce the famous Schwinger's correction to the magnetic
moment in QED from a tree-level cross-section calculation and outline the
procedure for computing the two-loop correction from a one-loop cross-section

relativistic chiral EFT framework. In particular we investigate the chiral

determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy: Is the order of the neutrino
masses ``normal'' - m_1^2<m_2^2<m_3^2 - or is it inverted - m_3^2<m_1^2<m_2^2,
with m_2^2-m_1^2 << m_2^2,m_1^2? While this issue can be resolved in
next-generation long-baseline nu_{mu} to nu_e neutrino oscillation studies if
|U_{e3}|^2 is large enough, a clear strategy on how to resolve it if |U_{e3}|^2
is sufficiently small is still lacking. We study the capability of
non-oscillation probes of neutrino masses to determine the neutrino mass
ordering. We concentrate on studies of m_{nu_e}, the kinematical neutrino mass
to which precise studies of tritium beta-decay are sensitive, m_{ee}, the
effective mass to which the rate for neutrinoless double-beta decay is
sensitive if the neutrinos are Majorana fermions, and Sigma, the sum of the
neutrino masses, to which cosmological probes of the energy budget of the
Universe are sensitive. We find that combined measurements of m_{ee}, Sigma,

previous sentence in detail by performing a numerical analysis of a large

hadronic molecule. Its production mechanism and special decay pattern do not
favor the glueball interpretation. If Y(4260) is a scalar tetraquark, it must
be produced by the I=0 component of the virtual photon. Then the $I=1, I_z=0$
component of the virtual photon should have produced its isovector partner
$Y^\prime (4260)$, which may be searched for in the decay channel
$\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0 J/\psi$ using exactly the same database from the initial state
radiation process. The observation/non-observation of $Y^\prime (4260)$ can
easily confirm/reject the tetraquark hypothesis. However, a tetraquark far
above threshold can fall apart into $D\bar D, D^\ast\bar D$ very easily. Its
not-so-large width and the non-observation of $D\bar D$ mode tend to disfavor
the tetraquark hypothesis. Hence the only feasible interpretation is a hybrid
charmonium if Y(4260) is {\sl NOT} an experimental artifact. At present, none
of the experimental information from BABAR measurement is in conflict with the

effective in two respects: (i) the shift vector can be chosen so as to dilute
the effect of anisotropy on the late-time value of the extrinsic curvature of
the spacelike hypersurfaces of the foliation; and (ii) pure gauge solutions
present in a similar calculation using the synchronous gauge vanish when the

furthermore verify the main conclusion of the synchronous gauge calculation

of a perfect-fluid with a barotropic equation of state--violates the
strong-energy condition. Finally, we obtain the solution for the lapse function

feature of this approach is that, from an underlying quantum gravity
perspective, the resulting long distance (or large time) effective
gravitational action inherits only one adjustable parameter $\xi$, having the
units of a length, arising from dimensional transmutation in the gravitational
sector. Assuming the above scenario to be correct, some simple predictions for

quantum system causing an adiabatic change of the external conditions under
which it is placed. This paper is the second installment of a work scrutinizing
this effect with the use of algebraic methods in quantum theory. The general
scheme worked out in the first part is applied here to the discussion of
particular models. We consider models of the quantum scalar field subject to
external interaction with ``softened'' Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions
on two parallel planes. We show that the case of electromagnetic field with
softened perfect conductor conditions on the planes may be reduced to the other
two. The ``softening'' is implemented on the level of the dynamics, and is not
imposed ad hoc, as is usual in most treatments, on the level of observables. We
calculate formulas for the backreaction energy in these models. We find that
the common belief that for electromagnetic field the backreaction force tends
to the strict Casimir formula in the limit of ``removed cutoff'' is not
confirmed by our strict analysis. The formula is model dependent and the
Casimir value is merely a term in the asymptotic expansion of the formula in
inverse powers of the distance of the planes. Typical behaviour of the energy
for large separation of the plates in the class of models considered is a
quadratic fall-of. Depending on the details of the ``softening'' of the
boundary conditions the backreaction force may become repulsive for large
separations.

of random surface models arising from dimer models. The limit shapes are
minimizers of a surface tension functional, that is, they minimize, for fixed
boundary conditions, the integral of a quantity (the surface tension) depending
only on the slope of the surface. The surface tension as a function of the
slope has singularities and is not strictly convex, which leads to formation of
facets and edges in the limit shapes.
  We find a change of variables that reduces the Euler-Lagrange equation for
the variational problem to the complex inviscid Burgers equation (complex Hopf
equation). The equation can thus be solved in terms of an arbitrary holomorphic
function, which is somewhat similar in spirit to Weierstrass parametrization of
minimal surfaces. We further show that for a natural dense set of boundary
conditions, the holomorphic function in question is, in fact, algebraic. The
tools of algebraic geometry can thus be brought in to study the the minimizers
and, especially, the formation of their singularities. This is illustrated by
several explicitly computed examples.

array of high bandwidth antennas is presented. Multi-kilometer cable runs
complicate acquisition of such large bandwidth radio signals from an extensive
antenna array. Solutions using analog fiber optic links are being explored,
though are very expensive. We propose an inexpensive solution that allows for
individual operation of each antenna element, operating at potentially high
local self-trigger rates. Digitized data packets are transmitted to the surface
via commercially available Giga-bit Ethernet hardware. Events are then
reconstructed on a computer farm by sorting the received packets using standard
networking gear, eliminating the need for custom, very high-speed trigger
hardware. Such a system is completely scalable and leverages the hugh capital
investment made by the telecommunications industry. Test results from a
demonstration prototype are presented.

(2005), to appear",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.046101",,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph",,"  We report experimental observations on the effect of disorder on the phase
behavior of DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies. Variation in DNA linker lengths
results in different melting temperatures of the DNA-linked nanoparticle
assemblies. We observed an unusual trend of a non-monotonic ``zigzag'' pattern
in the melting temperature as a function of DNAlinker length. Linker DNA
resulting in unequal DNA duplex lengths introduces disorder and lowers the
melting temperature of the nanoparticle system. Comparison with free DNA
thermodynamics shows that such an anomalous zigzag pattern does not exist for
free DNA duplex melting, which suggests that the disorder introduced by unequal
DNA duplex lengths results in this unusual collective behavior of DNA-linked
nanoparticle assemblies.

  (CG2004_A01_CCE-PG) (2004) 10 p., 4 fig., 3 tabl",,,"q-bio.PE",,"  The deep-water fauna of the Mediterranean is characterized by an absence of
distinctive characteristics and by a relative impoverishment. Both are a result
of events after the Messinian salinity crisis (Late Miocene). The three main
classes of phenomena involved in producing or recording these effects are
analysed and discussed: - Historical: Sequential faunal changes during the
Pliocene and thereafter in particular those during the Quaternary glaciations
and still in progress. - Bathymetric: Changes in the vertical aspects of the
Bathyal and Abyssal zones that took place under peculiar conditions, i.e.
homothermy, a relative oligotrophy, the barrier of the Gibraltar sill, and
water mass movement. The deeper the habitat of a species in the Mediterranean,
the more extensive is its distribution elsewhere. - Geographical: There are
strong affinities and relationships between Mediterranean and Atlantic faunas.
Endemic species remain a biogeographical problem. Species always become smaller
in size eastward where they occupy a progressively deeper habitat. Thus, the
existing deep Mediterranean Sea appears to be younger than any other deep-sea
constituent of the World Ocean.

"quant-ph/0507014","Paul Slater","Paul B. Slater","Noninformative Quantum q-Priors","18 pages, 8 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We find, in an analysis involving four prior probabilities (p's), that the
information-theoretic-based comparative noninformativity test devised by
Clarke, and applied by Slater in a quantum setting, yields a ranking
(p_{F_{q=1}} > p_{B} > p_{B_{q=1}trunc} >p_{F}) fully consistent with
Srednicki's recently-stated criterion for priors of ``biasedness to pure
states''. Two of the priors are formed by extending certain metrics of
quantum-theoretic interest from three- to four-dimensions -- by incorporating
the q-parameter (nonextensivity/Tsallis index/escort parameter). The
three-dimensional metrics are the Bures (minimal monotone) metric over the
two-level quantum systems and the Fisher information metric over the
corresponding family of Husimi distributions. The priors p_{B} and p_{F} are
the (independent-of-q) normalized volume elements of these metrics, and
p_{F_{q=1}} is the normalized volume element of the q-extended Fisher
information metric, with q set to 1. While originally intended to similarly be
the q-extension of the Bures metric, with q then set to 1, the prior
p_{B_{q=1}trunc}, actually entails the truncation of the only off-diagonal
entry of the extended Bures metric tensor. Without this truncation, the
q-extended Bures volume element is null, as is also the case in two other
quantum scenarios we examine.
