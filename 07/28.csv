region immediately behind a stalled accretion shock, after core bounce. This
model demonstrates that a negative entropy gradient is not sufficient to
warrant linear instability. The stability criterion is governed by the ratio
\chi of the advection time through the gain region divided by the local
timescale of buoyancy. The gain region is linearly stable if \chi< 3. The
classical convective instability is recovered in the limit \chi\gg 3. For
\chi>3, perturbations are unstable in a limited range of horizontal wavelengths
centered around twice the vertical size H of the gain region. The threshold
horizontal wavenumbers k_{min} and k_{max} follow simple scaling laws such that
Hk_{min}\propto 1/{\chi} and Hk_{max}\propto \chi. The convective stability of
the l=1 mode in spherical accretion is discussed, in relation with the
asymmetric explosion of core collapse supernovae. The advective stabilization
of long wavelength perturbations weakens the possible influence of convection
alone on a global l=1 mode.

probably in the range M_i = 3-7 M_sun. The extinction map shows a largely
symmetric, and compact dust structure, which is most likely a shell, located at
the neck of the bipolar flow, only 4 arcsec from the star. The dust shell
traces a short-lived phase of very high mass loss at the end of the AGB. The
dynamical age of the shell and bipolar lobes are very similar but the
morphologies are very different. The data suggests that the mass loss during
the ejection of the compact shell was largely spherically symmetric, and the
pronounced bipolarity formed afterwards. The dynamical ages of the bipolar
lobes and dust shell are similar, which is consistent with suggestions that
bipolar structures form in a run-away event at the very last stages of the AGB
mass loss. The inner edge of the dust shell is ionized, and PAH emission is
seen just outside the ionized gas. We associate the PAH emission with the
photo-dissociation region of the molecular shell.

The simulation follows gravitational and gas dynamics and includes a treatment
of physical processes like radiative cooling, star formation and supernova
feedback. From the simulation outputs, we produce a set of two-dimensional maps
of the intergalactic medium X-ray emission integrated over redshift. We find
that the signal in the soft (0.5-2 keV) band is lognormally distributed with a
mean intensity of about 4 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2; approximately 40 per
cent of the emission originates from warm-hot gas (defined as baryons with
10^5<T<10^7 K), and 90 per cent comes from structures at z<0.9. Since the
spectrum is soft, being mostly provided by the intergalactic medium at low
temperature, the total mean intensity in the hard (2-10 keV) X-ray band is
smaller by a factor of about 4. In order to constrain the physical processes
included in our simulation, we compare our results with the observed upper
limit (1.2 +/- 0.3) 10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 deg^-2 of the soft X-ray emission due
to diffuse gas. To this purpose, we remove the contributions of observable
extended objects (groups and clusters of galaxies) from the simulated maps by
adopting different detectability criteria which are calibrated on the
properties of systems at intermediate redshifts observed by Chandra. We show
that the simulated diffuse soft X-ray emission is consistent with the present
observed upper limit. However, if future measurements will decrease the level
of the unresolved X-ray background by a factor of two, a more efficient
feedback mechanism should be required to suppress the soft emission of the gas
residing within filaments and group-size haloes.

perturbations on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
anisotropies. We find that the amplitude of the lensing peak in the BB mode
power spectrum is a faithful tracer of the dark energy dynamics at the onset of
cosmic acceleration. This is due to two reasons. First, the lensing power is
non-zero only at intermediate redshifts between the observer and the source,
keeping record of the linear perturbation growth rate at the corresponding
epoch. Second, the BB lensing signal is expected to dominate over the other
sources. The lensing distortion on the TT and EE spectra do exhibit a similar
dependence on the dark energy dynamics, although those are dominated by primary
anisotropies. We investigate and quantify the effect by means of exact tracking
quintessence models, as well as parameterizing the dark energy equation of
state in terms of the present value ($w_{0}$) and its asymptotic value in the
past ($w_{\infty}$); in the interval allowed by the present constraints on dark
energy, the variation of $w_{\infty}$ induces a significant change in the BB
mode lensing amplitude. A Fisher matrix analysis, under conservative
assumptions concerning the increase of the sample variance due to the lensing
non-Gaussian statistics, shows that a precision of order 10% on both $w_{0}$
and $w_{\infty}$ is achievable by the future experiments probing a large sky
area with angular resolution and sensitivity appropriate to detect the lensing
effect on the CMB angular power spectrum. These results show that the CMB can
probe the differential redshift behavior of the dark energy equation of state,
beyond its average.

data from Spitzer, 2MASS, ISO, IRAS, and SCUBA. The infrared colors derived
from the globally-integrated Spitzer data are generally consistent with the
previous generation of models that were developed based on global data for
normal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.
Spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailed
investigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for various
locations within the three large, nearby galaxies NGC3031 (M81), NGC5194 (M51),
and NGC7331. Strong correlations exist between the local star formation rate
and the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),
suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local star
formation activity level. Preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the
24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colors
within NGC3031, NGC5194, and NGC7331. If the galaxy-to-galaxy variations in

amplitude of the groups, the estimated minimum group dark matter halo mass is

with a scale-dependent relative bias which falls from b~2.5 +/-0.3 at r_p=0.1
Mpc/h to b~1 +/-0.5 at r_p=10 Mpc/h. The correlation functions for all galaxies
and galaxies in groups can be fit by a power-law on scales r_p=0.05-20 Mpc/h.
We empirically measure the contribution to the projected correlation function
for galaxies in groups from a `one-halo' term and a `two-halo' term by counting
pairs of galaxies in the same or in different groups. The projected
cross-correlation between shows that red galaxies are more centrally
concentrated in groups than blue galaxies at z~1. DEEP2 galaxies in groups
appear to have a shallower radial distribution than that of mock galaxy
catalogs made from N-body simulations, which assume a central galaxy surrounded
by satellite galaxies with an NFW profile. We show that the clustering of
galaxies in groups can be used to place tighter constraints on the halo model
than can be gained from using the usual galaxy correlation function alone.

common ions CIV and SiIV that are the principal metal tracers in the
intergalactic medium outside of the Ly alpha forest. Optical depths are
statistically corrected for contamination by other lines, telluric absorption,
bad pixels, continuum fitting, etc. and for incompleteness, and we achieve in
this way an increased sensitivity of approximately 0.5 dex over previous
analyses. Unlike existing POD techniques, we do not compare the ion optical
depths with HI optical depths; we therefore avoid problems arising from
different velocity widths in the ion and HI. We have shown how the conventional
analysis can be reproduced using a percolation method to generate pseudo-clouds
from ion optical depths. We find that for the higher resolution HIRES data
there is a tight relation, tau ~ N^{0.7}, between the peak optical depth and
the column density. From the optical depth vectors themselves we show that
there is little evolution in the total amount of CIV from z = 2 to z = 5,

ratios with the radio emission seen in ground based observations are clarified

surface brightness emission line gas mainly along the radio source axis. The
lowest ionization gas is seen at the Eastern hot spot. In 3C 277.3 there is
bright high ionization gas (and continuum) offset just to the east of the radio

this emission is produced by precursor gas ionized by the shock being driven
into the cloud by the deflected radio jet. In PKS 2250-41 we resolve the

lower ionization [OII] emission is nested just interior to the higher

essential that such paradigm will be defined before the data is unblinded. Key

Wolf-Rayet stars. We argue that the circumstellar absorption lines in early
supernova and in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may allow us to determine
the main properties of the Wolf-Rayet star progenitors which can produce those
two events. To demonstrate this, we first simulate the hydrodynamic evolution
of the circumstellar medium around a 40 Msun star up to the time of the
supernova explosion. Knowledge of density, temperature and radial velocity of
the circumstellar matter as function of space and time allows us to compute the
column density in the line of sight to the centre of the nebula, as a function
of radial velocity, angle, and time. Our column density profiles indicate the
possible number, strengths, widths and velocities of absorption line components
in supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra. Our example calculation
shows four distinct line features during the Wolf-Rayet stage, at about 0, 50,
150-700 and 2200 km/s, with only those of the lowest and highest velocity
present at all times. The 150-700 km/s feature decays rapidly as function of
time after the onset of the Wolf-Rayet stage. It consists of a variable number
of components, and, especially in its evolved stage, is depending strongly on
the particular line of sight. A comparison with absorption lines detected in
the afterglow of GRB 021004 suggests that the high velocity absorption
component in GRB 021004 may be attributed to the free streaming Wolf-Rayet
wind, which is consistent with the steep density drop indicated by the
afterglow light curve. The presence of the intermediate velocity components
implies that the duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase of the progenitor of GRB
021004 was much smaller than the average Wolf-Rayet life time.

density rho_Lambda and the Newton constant G_N are varying quantities, to study
the problem of setting an effective field-theory IR cutoff. Assuming that
ordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation
univocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either
rho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy
disfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially
flat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is
not allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the
redshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for
the IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence
problem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to
spatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice
for the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a
universe that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from
deceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff
consistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy
variation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses
near the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance
with holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square
root of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only
undetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give
early deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of
further improvement of the model is also briefly indicated.

thus these bands are dominated by starlight. In contrast, the [5.8 micron] -
[8.0 micron] colors are consistent with those of interstellar dust, and vary by
about 0.2 magnitudes around the ring/spiral, with redder colors associated with
regions with stronger star formation as indicated by H-alpha and mid-infrared
luminosity. The [4.5 micron] - [5.8 micron] colors for clumps in this arm are
bluer than dust and redder than stars, and vary by 1.3 magnitudes around the

old stars, with a redder color indicating a higher proportion of young stars.
There is a clear azimuthal sequence in the [4.5] - [5.8] color around the arm,
indicating a sequence in average stellar age. The L(H-alpha)/L(8.0 micron)
ratio varies around the arm by a factor of ~7; this variation may be due to
extinction or to PAH excitation by non-ionizing photons. Our model of Arp 107

relates to ensembles, not to individual states. This disorder is measured by
the logarithm of ensemble volume, the entropy. But recent results about measure
concentration effects in analysis and geometry allow us to return from the
ensemble--based point of view to a state--based one, at least, partially. In
this paper, the order--disorder problem is represented as a problem of relation
between distance and measure. The effect of strong order--disorder separation
for multiparticle systems is described: the phase space could be divided into
two subsets, one of them (set of disordered states) has almost zero diameter,
the second one has almost zero measure. The symmetry with respect to
permutations of particles is responsible for this type of concentration.
Dynamics of systems with strong order--disorder separation has high average
acceleration squared, which can be interpreted as evolution through a series of
collisions (acceleration--dominated dynamics). The time arrow direction from
order to disorder follows from the strong order--disorder separation. But,
inverse, for systems in space of symmetric configurations with ``sticky
boundaries"" the way back from disorder to order is typical (Natural selection).
Recommendations for mining of molecular dynamics results are presented also.

the tunneling of the Cooper pairs. We show that in this regime, the oscillator

ferroelectric domain inversion in the whole LiNbO3 crystal by writing the 2-D
square pattern on the negative c-face. Such a structure may be utilized to

increase/decrease their utility by linking to nodes with a higher/lower degree

systems and discuss the temperature dependence of the emerging networks. We
observe the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ where total energy
(utility) and network-architecture undergo radical changes. Along this
topological transition we obtain scale-free networks with complex hierarchical
topology. In contrast to models for scale-free networks introduced so far, the
scale-free nature emerges within equilibrium, with a clearly defined
microcanonical ensemble and the principle of detailed balance strictly
fulfilled. This provides clear evidence that 'complex' networks may arise
without irreversibility. The results presented here should find a wide variety

in the literature because of their generality and because a few exact
predictions are among them. However its application to Physics problems
requires attention and can lead to apparent inconsistencies. In particular
there are several cases that have been considered in the literature in which
singularities are built in the models: for instance when among the forces there
are Lennard-Jones potentials (which are infinite in the origin) and the
constraints imposed on the system do not forbid arbitrarily close approach to
the singularity even though the average kinetic energy is bounded. The
situation is well understood in certain special cases in which the system is
subject to Gaussian noise; here the treatment of rather general singular
systems is considered and the predictions of the chaotic hypothesis for such
situations are derived. The main conclusion is that the chaotic hypothesis is
perfectly adequate to describe the singular physical systems we consider, i.e.
deterministic systems with thermostat forces acting according to Gauss'
principle for the constraint of constant total kinetic energy (``isokinetic
Gaussian thermostats''), close and far from equilibrium. Near equilibrium it
even predicts a fluctuation relation which, in deterministic cases with more
general thermostat forces (i.e. not necessarily of Gaussian isokinetic nature),
extends recent relations obtained in situations in which the thermostatting
forces satisfy Gauss' principle. This relation agrees, where expected, with the
fluctuation theorem for perfectly chaotic systems. The results are compared
with some recent works in the literature.

degenerate Fermi liquid with arbitrary relationship between temperature and
polarization are derived from Landau-Silin phenomenological kinetic equation
with general form of two-particle collision integral. Unlike the previous
treatment where Fermi velocity and density of states have been taken as
constants independent of polarization here we made derivation free from this

dynamics in paramagnetic Fermi liquid with finite polarization as well in an

be proportional to the square of the wave vector with complex constant of
proportionality (diffusion coefficient) such that the damping has a finite

to be different for a polarized Fermi liquid and for an itinerant ferromagnet.
These conclusions are confirmed by derivation of transverse spin wave

  This behavior of polarized Fermi liquid contrasts with the behavior of

attenuation appears in terms proportional to the wave vector in fourth power.
  The reactive part of diffusion coefficient in paramagnetic state at T=0
proves to be inversely proportional to magnetization whereas in ferromagnetic

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.DB cs.AI",,"  Query containment and query answering are two important computational tasks
in databases. While query answering amounts to compute the result of a query
over a database, query containment is the problem of checking whether for every
database, the result of one query is a subset of the result of another query.
  In this paper, we deal with unions of conjunctive queries, and we address
query containment and query answering under Description Logic constraints.
Every such constraint is essentially an inclusion dependencies between concepts
and relations, and their expressive power is due to the possibility of using
complex expressions, e.g., intersection and difference of relations, special
forms of quantification, regular expressions over binary relations, in the
specification of the dependencies. These types of constraints capture a great
variety of data models, including the relational, the entity-relationship, and
the object-oriented model, all extended with various forms of constraints, and
also the basic features of the ontology languages used in the context of the
Semantic Web.
  We present the following results on both query containment and query
answering. We provide a method for query containment under Description Logic
constraints, thus showing that the problem is decidable, and analyze its
computational complexity. We prove that query containment is undecidable in the
case where we allow inequalities in the right-hand side query, even for very
simple constraints and queries. We show that query answering under Description
Logic constraints can be reduced to query containment, and illustrate how such
a reduction provides upper bound results with respect to both combined and data
complexity.

parity check collection for codes of codimension r correcting all correctable
erasure patterns of size at most m, for all r and m <= r, thus generalising the
known construction for m=3. Then we discussoptimality of our construction and

standard gluo-dissociation, g+Upsilon -> b + b-bar, inefficient due to a
substantial reduction in final-state phase space. This problem is overcome by

bulk contains only a cosmological constant Lambda_B, we find that the isotropic
evolution of the brane-universe imposes a tuned relation between the energy
density and the brane equation of state. The evolution of the system has fixed
points (attractors), which correspond to a final state of radiation for
Lambda_B=0 and to de Sitter state for Lambda_B>0. Furthermore, considering
anisotropic matter on the brane, the tuning of the parameters is lifted, and
new regions of the parametric space are available for the cosmological
evolution of the brane-universe. The analysis of the dynamics of the system
shows that, the isotropic fixed points remain attractors of the system, and for
values of Lambda_B which give acceptable cosmological evolution of the equation
of state, the line of isotropic tuning is a very weak attractor. The initial
conditions, in this case, need to be fine tuned to have an evolution with
acceptably small anisotropy.

the pion mass to its experimental value and fit the two remaining Skyrme
parameters by approximating the spinning Skyrmion as a rigid body. In this
paper we remove the rigid body approximation and perform numerical calculations
which allow the spinning Skyrmion to deform and break spherical symmetry. The
results show that if the pion mass is set to its experimental value then the
nucleon and delta masses can not be reproduced for any values of the Skyrme
parameters; the commonly used Skyrme parameters are simply an artifact of the
rigid body approximation. However, if the pion mass is taken to be
substantially larger than its experimental value then the nucleon and delta
masses can be reproduced. This result has a significant effect on the structure

defined consisting of systems that can follow any sufficiently smooth non-stop

trajectory on the plane is performed in two steps. On the first step the
trajectory on the configuration manifold of the system and the input function
are constructed that ensure the exact reproduction of the desired trajectory on
the plane. The second step is the stabilization of the constructed trajectory
on the configuration manifold of the system. For this purpose a recursive
procedure is used that is a version of backstepping algorithm meant for
non-stationary systems nonlinearly depending on input. The procedure results in
the continuous memoryless feedback that stabilizes the trajectory on the
configuration manifold of the system. As an example the motion control problem
for a truck with multiple trailers is considered. It is shown that the proposed
control law stabilizes the desired trajectory of the vehicle on the plane for
all initial states of the system from some open dense submanifold of the
configuration manifold, i.e., almost globally. The statement takes place both
for a truck pulling any number of trailers in a forward direction and for a
truck pushing any number of trailers in a backward direction. The latter result

Jacobian $J_F(x)=\text{det} DF(x)\ge 0$ a.e. in a domain $\Omega\in \Bbb R^n$.
The dilatation of the mapping $F$ is defined, almost everywhere in $\Omega$, by
the formula $$K(x)={{|DF(x)|^n}\over {J_F(x)}}.$$ If $K(x)$ is bounded a.e.,
the mapping is said to be quasiregular. Quasiregular mappings are a
generalization to higher dimensions of holomorphic mappings. The theory of
higher dimensional quasiregular mappings began with Re\v{s}hetnyak's theorem,
stating that non constant quasiregular mappings are continuous, discrete and
open.
  In some problems appearing in the theory of non-linear elasticity, the
boundedness condition on $K(x)$ is too restrictive. Tipically we only know that
$F$ has finite dilatation, that is, $K(x)$ is finite a.e. and $K(x)^p$ is
integrable for some value $p$. In two dimensions, Iwaniec and \v{S}verak [IS]
have shown that $K(x)\in L^1_{loc}$ is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion
of Re\v{s}hetnyak's theorem.
  For $n\ge 3$, Heinonen and Koskela [HK], showed that if the mapping is
quasi-light and $K(x)\in L^p_{loc}$ for $p>n-1$, then the mapping $F(x)$ is
continuous, discrete and open. Manfredi and Villamor [MV] proved a similar
result without assuming that the mapping $f(x)$ was quasi-light. The result is
known to be false, see [Ball], when $p<n-1$.
  In this paper we attempt to improve in those results. In particular, we will
deal with the case $p=n-1$ for $n\ge 3$, and will assume that our mapping
$F(x)$ is quasi-light, that is, the inverse image of any point is compact in
$\Omega$.
  Our approach will be different from the ones used in [MV] and [HK]. It is
more geometrical in nature and uses the method of extremal length.

of the famous original F. and M. Riesz's uniqueness theorem that states that if
a bounded analytic function in the unit disc of the complex plane $\Bbb C$ has
the same radial limit in a set of positive Lebesgue measure on its boundary,
then the function has to be constant. First Beurling [B], considering the case
of non-constant meromorphic functions mapping the unit disc on a Riemann
surface of finite spherical area, was able to prove that if such a function
showed an appropriate behavior in the neighborhood of the limit value where the
function maps a set on the boundary of the unit disc, then those sets have
logarithmic capacity zero. The author of the present note, in [V], was able to
weaken Beurling's condition on the limit value.
  Those results where quite restrictive in a two folded way, namely, they were
in dimension $n=2$ and the regularity requirements on the treated functions
were quite strong. Koskela in [K], was able to remove those two restrictions by
proving a uniqueness result for functions in $ACL^p(\Bbb B^n)$ for values of
$p$ in the interval $(1,n]$. Koskela also shows in his paper that his result is
sharp..

Lagrangian theorem's main ``ingredient'', apart from cyclic coordinates, is the
rectification of vector fields afforded by the local existence and uniqueness

the main extra ingredients are the asymmetry of the Poisson bracket, and the
fact that a vector field generates canonical transformations iff it is

  Handbook of Philosophy of Physics, edited by JOhn Earman and Jeremy
  Butterfield",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph physics.hist-ph",,"  This paper expounds the modern theory of symplectic reduction in
finite-dimensional Hamiltonian mechanics. This theory generalizes the
well-known connection between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities,
i.e. Noether's theorem. It also illustrates one of mechanics' grand themes:
exploiting a symmetry so as to reduce the number of variables needed to treat a
problem. The exposition emphasises how the theory provides insights about the
rotation group and the rigid body. The theory's device of quotienting a state
space also casts light on philosophical issues about whether two apparently
distinct but utterly indiscernible possibilities should be ruled to be one and
the same. These issues are illustrated using ``relationist'' mechanics.

topology. Our model displays a transition from a fully connected network to a
configuration with a non-trivial topology and where global failures are
suppressed. The most efficient topology is characterized by an exponential
degree distribution, in agreement with the topology of the real electric grid.
The model intrinsically presents self-induced break-down events, which can be
thought as representative of real black-outs.

the tippe top, assuming a modified Coulomb law for the sliding friction, which
is a continuous function of the slip velocity $\vec v_P$ at the point of
contact and vanishes at $\vec v_P=0$. We study the relevance of the gyroscopic
balance condition (GBC), which was discovered to hold for a rapidly spinning
hard-boiled egg by Moffatt and Shimomura, to the inversion phenomenon of the
tippe top. We introduce a variable $\xi$ so that $\xi=0$ corresponds to the GBC
and analyze the behavior of $\xi$. Contrary to the case of the spinning egg,
the GBC for the tippe top is not fulfilled initially. But we find from
simulation that for those tippe tops which will turn over, the GBC will soon be
satisfied approximately. It is shown that the GBC and the geometry lead to the
classification of tippe tops into three groups: The tippe tops of Group I never
flip over however large a spin they are given. Those of Group II show a
complete inversion and the tippe tops of Group III tend to turn over up to a
certain inclination angle $\theta_f$ such that $\theta_f<\pi$, when they are
spun sufficiently rapidly. There exist three steady states for the spinning
motion of the tippe top. Giving a new criterion for stability, we examine the
stability of these states in terms of the initial spin velocity $n_0$. And we
obtain a critical value $n_c$ of the initial spin which is required for the
tippe top of Group II to flip over up to the completely inverted position.

defined by a genome in the form of a bitstring, and the interactions between
species i and j are given by a fixed matrix with independent, randomly
distributed elements M_{ij}. A consequence of the stochastic independence is
that species whose genotypes differ even by a single bit may have completely
different phenotypes. This is clearly unrealistic, as closely related species
should be similar in their interactions with the rest of the ecosystem. Here we
therefore study a model, in which the M_{ij} are correlated to a controllable
degree. We calculate, both analytically and numerically, the correlation
function for matrix elements M_{ij} and M_{kl} versus the Hamming distance
between the bitstrings representing the species. We compare Monte Carlo
simulations of coevolution models with uncorrelated and correlated
interactions. In particular, we consider the lifetimes of individual species.
The species-lifetime distribution is close to a power law with an exponent near
-2 in both uncorrelated and correlated cases. The durations of quasi-steady
states and power spectral densities for the diversity indices display
noticeable differences. However, some qualitative features, like 1/f behaviour
in power spectral densities for the diversity indices, are not affected by the
correlations in the interaction matrix.

B19 (2005) 3063","10.1142/S0217979205032097",,"quant-ph cond-mat.other hep-th",,"  We review the standard treatment of open quantum systems in relation to
quantum entanglement, analyzing, in particular, the behaviour of bipartite
systems immersed in a same environment. We first focus upon the notion of
complete positivity, a physically motivated algebraic constraint on the quantum
dynamics, in relation to quantum entanglement, i.e. the existence of
statistical correlations which can not be accounted for by classical
probability. We then study the entanglement power of heat baths versus their
decohering properties, a topic of increasing importance in the framework of the
fast developing fields of quantum information, communication and computation.
The presentation is self contained and, through several examples, it offers a
detailed survey of the physics and of the most relevant and used techniques
relative to both quantum open system dynamics and quantum entanglement.

eigenfunctions of the PT-/non-PT-symmetric and non-Hermitian generalized
Woods-Saxon (WS) potential with the real and complex-valued energy levels are
obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. According to the PT-symmetric
quantum mechanics, we exactly solved the time-independent Schrodinger equation
with same potential for the s-states and also for any l-state as well. It is
shown that the results are in good agreement with the ones obtained before.
