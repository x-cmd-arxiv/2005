the higher sensitivity of the SIS for higher energy photons compared to the
ROSAT PSPC, we are able to detect a T ~ 8x10^6 K plasma component in addition
to the T ~ 1.3x10^6 K component previously detected in PSPC observations. No
significant temperature variations are detected within NGC6888. Garcia-Segura &
Mac Low's (1995) analytical models of WR bubbles constrained by the observed
size, expansion velocity, and mass of the nebular shell under-predict the
stellar wind luminosity, and cannot reproduce simultaneously the observed X-ray
luminosity, spectrum, surface brightness profile, and SIS count rate of
NGC6888's bubble interior. The agreement between observations and expectations
from models can be improved if one or more of the following ad hoc assumptions
are made: (1) the stellar wind luminosity was weaker in the past, (2) the
bubble is at a special evolutionary stage and the nebular shell has recently
been decelerated to 1/2 of its previous expansion velocity, and (3) the heat
conduction between the hot interior and the cool nebular shell is suppressed.
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations with high spatial resolution and high
sensitivity are needed to determine accurately the physical conditions
NGC6888's interior hot gas for critical comparisons with bubble models.

  Physics","Astropart.Phys.24:301-315,2005","10.1016/j.astropartphys.2005.07.003",,"astro-ph",,"  Fast spinning magnetars are discussed as strong sources of high energy
neutrinos. Pulsars may be born with a short rotation period of milliseconds
with the magnetic field amplified through dynamo processes up to $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16} \rm G$. As such millisecond magnetars (MSMs) have an enormous
spin-down power $\sim 10^{50} {\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}$, they can be potentially
a strong, extragalactic high-energy neutrino source. Specifically, acceleration
of ions and subsequent photomeson production within the MSM magnetosphere are
considered. As in normal pulsars, particle acceleration leads to
electron-positron pair cascades that constrains the acceleration efficiency.
The limit on the neutrino power as a fraction of the spin-down power is
calculated. It is shown that neutrinos produced in the inner magnetosphere have
characteristic energy about a few $\times100$ GeV due to the constraint of
cooling of charged pions through inverse Compton scattering. TeV neutrinos may
be produced in the outer magnetosphere where ions can be accelerated to much
higher energies and the pion cooling is less severe than in the inner
magnetosphere. High energy neutrinos can also be produced from interactions
between ultra-high energy protons accelerated in the magnetosphere and a
diffuse thermal radiation from the ejecta or from the interaction region
between the MSM wind and remnant shell. The detectability of neutrinos in the
early spin-down phase by the current available and planned neutrino detectors
is discussed.

type is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or no

emission from the warped LINER NGC3718, obtained with the IRAM PdBI. This L1.9
galaxy has a prominent dust lane and on kpc scales, a strongly warped atomic
and molecular gas disk. The molecular gas is closely associated with the dust
lane across the nucleus and its kinematic center is consistent with the mm
continuum AGN. A comparison of our interferometric mosaic data, which fully
cover the ~9kpc warped disk, with a previously obtained IRAM 30m single dish
CO(1-0) map shows that the molecular gas distribution in the disk is heavily
resolved by the PdBI map. After applying a short-spacing correction with the
IRAM 30m data, we find in total six main source components within the dust
lane: one associated with the nucleus, four symmetrically positioned on either
side at galactocentric distances of about 1.3kpc and 4.0kpc from the center,
and a sixth on the western side at ~3kpc with only a very weak eastern
counterpart. In the framework of a kinematic model using tilted rings, we
interpret the five symmetric source components as locations of strong orbital
crowding. We further find indications that the warp appears not only on kpc
scales, but continues down to 250pc. Besides the sixth feature on the western
side, the lower flux of the eastern components compared to the western ones
indicates an intrinsic large scale asymmetry in NGC3718 that cannot be
explained by the warp. Indications for a small scale asymmetry are also seen in
the central 600pc. These asymmetries might be evidence for a tidal interaction
with a companion galaxy (large scales) and gas accretion onto the nucleus
(small scales). Our study of NGC3718 is part of the NUGA project that aims at
investigating the different processes of gas accretion onto AGN.

likely to evolve in parallel since the time they are produced in stars. We
argue that phosphorus, as traced by PII, is an excellent neutral oxygen tracer
in various physical environments, except when ionization corrections are a

constitute a source population which can be responsible for production of a
non-negligible fraction of the observed galactic cosmic rays. These
relativistic protons, associated with the termination of the jet, interact with
the interstellar medium and, at certain surrounding conditions, may lead to
production of detectable fluxes of high-energy and very high-energy gamma-rays.
This radiation is accompanied by the broad-band emission of secondary electrons
from decays of $\pi^\pm$-mesons produced through synchrotron, bremstrahlung and
inverse Compton process. The features of broad-band emission initiated by
proton-proton (pp) interactions in such a scenario is discussed in the context
of the strategy of search for counterparts of high-energy and very high-energy
gamma-ray sources in the galactic plane.

microquasar LS 5039 indicate that accretion processes should mainly occur via a
radiatively driven wind. In such a scenario, significant X-ray variability
would be expected due to the eccentricity of the orbit. The source has been
observed at X-rays by several missions, although with a poor coverage that
prevents to reach any conclusion about orbital variability. Therefore, we
conducted RossiXTE observations of the microquasar system LS 5039 covering a
full orbital period of 4 days. Individual observations are well fitted with an
absorbed power-law plus a Gaussian at 6.7 keV, to account for iron line
emission that is probably a diffuse background feature. In addition, we have
taken into account that the continuum is also affected by significant diffuse
background contamination. Our results show moderate power-law flux variations
on timescales of days, as well as the presence of miniflares on shorter
timescales. The new orbital ephemeris of the system recently obtained by
Casares et al. have allowed us to show, for the first time, that an increase of
emission is seen close to the periastron passage, as expected in an accretion
scenario. Moreover, the detected orbital variability is a factor of ~4 smaller
than the one expected by using a simple wind accretion model, and we suggest
that an accretion disk around the compact object could be responsible for this
discrepancy. On the other hand, significant changes in the photon index are
also observed clearly anti-correlated with the flux variations. We interpret
the overall X-ray spectral characteristics of LS 5039 in the context of X-ray
radiation produced by inverse Compton and/or synchrotron processes in the jet
of this microquasar.

The amplitude of oscillations is found to decrease gradually with temperature
and to turn to zero without any jump at $T=T_0$, 3.5K below the resistive
transition temperature $T_c$ indicating the phase transition of the second

objects and labels). We consider the case of deterministically defined labels.
Traditionally, this task is studied under the assumption that examples are
independent and identically distributed. However, it turns out that many
results of pattern recognition theory carry over a weaker assumption. Namely,
under the assumption of conditional independence and identical distribution of
objects, while the only assumption on the distribution of labels is that the
rate of occurrence of each label should be above some positive threshold.
  We find a broad class of learning algorithms for which estimations of the
probability of a classification error achieved under the classical i.i.d.

respect to quantum metric perturbations is discussed. The two-point quantum
correlation functions for the metric perturbations can be described by the
Einstein-Langevin equation obtained in the framework of stochastic gravity.
These correlation functions agree, to leading order in the large $N$ limit,
with the quantum correlation functions of the theory of gravity interacting
with $N$ matter fields. The Einstein-Langevin equations exhibit runaway
solutions and methods to deal with these solutions are discussed. The validity
criterion is used to show that flat spacetime as a solution of semiclassical
gravity is stable and, consequently, a description based on semiclassical
gravity is a valid approximation in that case.

definition that allows both relations between things that are already

Since both space-time points in general relativity and elementary particles in
quantum theory fall into the latter category, I propose a principle of maximal
permutability as a criterion for the fundamental entities of any future theory
of ``quantum gravity''; i.e., a theory yielding both general relativity and
quantum field theory in appropriate limits. Then I review of a number of
current candidates for such a theory. First I look at the effective field
theory and asymptotic quantization approaches to general relativity, and then
at string theory. Then a discussion of some issues common to all approaches to
quantum gravity based on the full general theory of relativity argues that
processes, rather than states should be taken as fundamental in any such
theory. A brief discussion of the canonical approach is followed by a survey of
causal set theory, and a new approach to the question of which space-time
structures should be quantized ends the paper.

dimensions they will appear as strings with a small tension. We make an
observation that, in the presence of the vector bundle moduli, it might be
possible to stabilize a five-brane very close to the visible sector so that a
macroscopic open membrane connecting this five-brane and the visible brane will
have a sufficiently small length. We also discuss how to embed such cosmic
strings in heterotic models with stable moduli and whether they can be created

originally due to Saavedra: a Saavedra unit is a cancellative idempotent (in a
1-categorical sense). This notion is more economical than the usual notion in
terms of left-right constraints, and is motivated by higher category theory. To
start, we describe the semi-monoidal category of all possible unit structures
on a given semi-monoidal category and observe that it is contractible (if
nonempty). Then we prove that the two notions of units are equivalent in a
strong functorial sense. Next, it is shown that the unit compatibility
condition for a (strong) monoidal functor is precisely the condition for the
functor to lift to the categories of units, and it is explained how the notion
of Saavedra unit naturally leads to the equivalent non-algebraic notion of fair
monoidal category, where the contractible multitude of units is considered as a
whole instead of choosing one unit. To finish, the lax version of the unit
comparison is considered. The paper is self-contained. All arguments are
elementary, some of them of a certain beauty.

theorem in metric number theory is established. The key ingredient is a
`slicing' technique motivated by a standard result in geometric measure theory.
In short, `slicing' together with the Mass Transference Principle [3] allows us
to transfer Lebesgue measure theoretic statements for limsup sets associated
with linear forms to Hausdorff measure theoretic statements. This extends the
approach developed in [3] for simultaneous approximation. Furthermore, we
establish a new Mass Transference Principle which incorporates both forms of
approximation. As an application we obtain a complete metric theory for a
`fully' non-linear Diophantine problem within the linear forms setup.

desirable to collide beams at some crossing angle. An especially large crossing
angle, of about 25 mrad, is necessary for the photon collider, where disrupted
beams are softer and wider than in the e+e- case. Some complications arise due
to the solenoidal magnetic field of the detector. Radiation of particles in
this field can increase the vertical beam size, leading to a loss of the
luminosity. In addition, in the presence of a detector magnetic field the beam
trajectories are not flat. Moreover, in the case of e-e- beams, the vertical
collision angle is non-zero and larger than the beam diagonal angle
sigma_y/sigma_z, and this should be corrected in some way. In this paper,
possible solutions of these problems are considered. It is shown that at the
ILC one can have the interaction region compatible both with e+e- and
gamma-gamma, gamma-e modes of operation without loss of luminosity.
