339-4. The analysis has been done using data from pointed observations of the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer coordinated with radio observations. In the neutron
star systems the radio luminosity L_{R} is correlated with the characteristic
frequency of the L_{h} Lorentzian component detected contemporaneously in the
power spectrum, and anticorrelated with its strength. Similarly, in the black
hole system GX 339-4 L_{R} is correlated with the frequency of the L_{\ell}
component in the power spectrum, and anti-correlated with its strength. The
index of a power-law fit to the correlation is similar in both cases, L_{R}
\propto \nu^{~1.4} and L_{R} \propto (rms)^{-2.3}. At lower timing frequencies,
the radio luminosity is further found to be correlated with the characteristic
(break) frequency of the L_{b} component of the power spectra in the neutron
stars and, marginally, with the equivalent break frequency in GX 339-4. We
briefly discuss the coupling between the innermost regions of the accretion
disc and the production of the jet and, from the behaviour of the ms accreting
X-ray pulsars, the possible role of the NS magnetic field.

considering the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) structure of a 5Msun model with

slightly modified from those of single star evolution. Describing the model
surface as a Roche equipotential is also satisfactory until very close to the

of the system encodes the geometry and surface brightness profile of the disk.
In the mid- and far-infrared, the emission of the system is dominated by the
thermal emission from the cold dusty disk. For a system located at the Galactic
center, we find typical magnifications to be of order 10-20% or higher,
depending on the disk surface brightness profile, and the event lasts over one
year. At around 20 microns, where the emission for the star and the disk are
comparable, the difference in the emission areas results in a chromatic
microlensing event. Finally, in the near-infrared and visible, where the
emission of the star dominates, the fraction of star light directly reflected
by the disk slightly modifies the light curve of the system which is no longer
that of a point source. In each case, the corresponding light curve can be used
to probe some of the disk properties. A fraction of 0.1% to 1% optical

identify high-redshift galaxies. They are particularly interesting because they
probe not only the galaxies themselves but also the ionization state of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). The observed line strengths depend on the amount by
which each photon is able to redshift away from line center before encountering
neutral gas and hence on the size distribution of HII regions surrounding the
sources. Here, we use an analytic model of that size distribution to study the
effects of reionization on the luminosity function of Lyman-alpha emitters and
their observed spatial distribution. Our model includes the clustering of
high-redshift galaxies and thus contains ionized bubbles much larger than those
expected around isolated galaxies. As a result, Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies
remain visible earlier in reionization: we expect the number counts to decline
by only a factor ~2 (or 10) when the mean ionized fraction falls to x_i~0.75
(or 0.5) in the simplest model. Moreover, the absorption is not uniform across
the sky: galaxies remain visible only if they sit inside large bubbles, which
become increasingly rare as x_i decreases. Thus, the size distribution also
affects the apparent clustering of Lyman-alpha selected galaxies. On large
scales, it traces that of the large bubbles, which in our model are more biased
than the galaxies. On small scales, the clustering increases rapidly as x_i
decreases because large HII regions surround strong galaxy overdensities, so a
survey automatically selects only those galaxies with neighbours. The
transition between these two regimes occurs at the characteristic bubble size.
Hence, large Lyman-alpha galaxy surveys have the potential to measure directly
the size distribution of HII regions during reionization.

accretion rate stellar black holes based on X-ray data from RXTE and ASCA.
Three spectral regimes can be separated out by the behaviour of the observed
disk luminosity and temperature. The well established ""standard regime"" is seen
when the disk dominates the spectrum, where only a small fraction of the
luminosity is emitted in the power law tail. These spectra generally satisfy
the standard relation expected for thermal emission from a constant area,
namely that the disk bolometric luminosity, Ldisk, is proportional to its
maximum temperature, Tin^4. However, at higher luminosities this starts to
change to Tin^2. This ""apparently standard regime"" is still dominated by the
disk emission, but this difference luminosity-temperature relation and subtle
changes in spectral shape may show that another cooling process is required in
addition to radiative cooling. At intermediate luminosities there is an
anomalous regime (or weak very high state) where the disk temperature and
luminosity are less clearly related. These spectra are characterized by the
presence of a much stronger comptonized tail indicating high energy electrons.
When observed disk emission is corrected for the the effects of comptonisation
then these points lie back on the standard relation. The growth of this
comptonising corona is also clearly linked to the quasi-periodic oscillations,
as these are observed preferentially in the anomalous regime. This presented
picture was found to explain the spectral behavior of both black hole binaries
in our Galaxy and LMC. Spectral evolution of several bright ULXs observed with

or aligned over huge (~ 1 Gpc) regions of the sky located at both low (z ~ 0.5)
and high (z ~ 1.5) redshifts and characterized by different preferred
directions of the quasar polarization. In fact, there seems to exist a regular
alternance along the line of sight of regions of randomly and aligned
polarization vectors with a typical comoving length scale of 1.5 Gpc.
Furthermore, the mean polarization angle \bar{\theta} appears to rotate with
redshift at the rate of ~ 30\degr per Gpc. The symmetry of the the \bar{\theta}
-z relation is mirror-like, the mean polarization angle rotating clockwise with
increasing redshift in North Galactic hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the
South Galactic one. These characteristics make the alignment effect difficult
to explain in terms of local mechanisms, namely a contamination by interstellar
polarization in our Galaxy. While interpretations like a global rotation of the
Universe can potentially explain the effect, the properties we observe
qualitatively correspond to the dichroism and birefringence predicted by
photon-pseudoscalar oscillation within a magnetic field. Interestingly, the
alignment effect seems to be prominent along an axis not far from preferred
directions tentatively identified in the CMB maps. Although many questions and
more particularly the interpretation of the effect remain open, alignments of
quasar polarization vectors appear as a promising new way to probe the Universe

  Aussel",,,,"astro-ph",,"  (abridged) The old Star Cluster (SC) systems surrounding any sofar
investigated galaxy represent a powerful tool for the understanding of the
cosmological evolution of their host galaxies. Phases of enhanced cluster
formation can be identified by reliably age dating the clusters. These are
symptoms of violent star formation, results of intense starbursts as commonly
seen in merging nearby galaxies and high-z forming galaxies. However, the young
SC systems of nearby merging galaxies and the old SC systems of nearby passive
galaxies (most likely resulting from high-z starburst events of these galaxies)
appear to be significantly different in terms of their mass functions. Whether
this difference originates in differences in the formation physics/environment
or is only due to dynamical evolution of the cluster systems is currently a hot
issue. A main diagnostic for the survival probability of a newly formed cluster
is most likely its compactness, since less compact, fluffy clusters are more
vulnerable to destructive interactions with the galactic environment of the
cluster. For these reasons, we developed
  1) a tool to significantly improve photometry of nearby SCs (which appear
resolved on high-resolution images, provided e.g. by HST), by accurately
measuring and taking the cluster size into account, and
  2) a tool to effectively determine ages and masses (plus metallicities and
extinctions) of SCs from multi-wavelength photometry, ranging from the UV to
the NIR.

consider the case where the sampling is defined as in the simplest thresholding
selection scheme of the peaks of a Gaussian random field as well as the case of
the extraction of point distributions in high density regions from
gravitational N-body simulations. I show that an invariant scale under sampling
is represented by the zero-crossing scale of \xi(r). By considering recent
measurements in the 2dF and SDSS galaxy surveys I note that the zero-point
crossing length has not yet been clearly identified, while a dependence on the
finite sample size related to the integral constraint is manifest. I show that
this implies that other length scales derived from \xi(r) are also affected by
finite size effects. I discuss the theoretical implications of these results,
when considering the comparison of structures formed in N-body simulations and
observed in galaxy samples, and different tests to study this problem.

Atmosphere models including non-LTE treatment, spherical expansion and line
blanketing are computed with the code CMFGEN. Both UV and Ha lines are used to
derive wind properties while optical H and He lines give the stellar
parameters. Mass loss rates of all stars are found to be lower than expected
from the hydrodynamical predictions of Vink et al. (2001). For stars with log
L/Lsol > 5.2, the reduction is by less than a factor 5 and is mainly due to the
inclusion of clumping in the models. For stars with log L/Lsol < 5.2 the
reduction can be as high as a factor 100. The inclusion of X-ray emission in
models with low density is crucial to derive accurate mass loss rates from UV
lines. The modified wind momentum - luminosity relation shows a significant
change of slope around this transition luminosity. Terminal velocities of low
luminosity stars are also found to be low. The physical reason for such weak
winds is still not clear although the finding of weak winds in Galactic stars
excludes the role of a reduced metallicity. X-rays, through the change in the
ionisation structure they imply, may be at the origin of a reduction of the
radiative acceleration, leading to lower mass loss rates. A better
understanding of the origin of X-rays is of crucial importance for the study of
the physics of weak winds.

The global kinematics and morphology refined by large surveys such as 2MASS

stellar proper motions, and is compatible with the M$_{bh}$-$\sigma$ relation

which show the drifting subpulse phenomenon by 42, indicating that at least one
in three pulsars exhibits this phenomenon. The real fraction of pulsars which
show the drifting phenomenon is likely to be larger than some 55%. The majority
of the analysed pulsars show subpulse modulation (170), of which the majority
were not previously known to show subpulse modulation and 30 show clear
systematic drifting. The large number of new drifters we have found allows us,
for the first time, to do meaningful statistics on the drifting phenomenon. We
find that the drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar age such that
drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars. Pulsars which drift more
coherently seem to be older and have a lower modulation index. There is no
significant correlation found between P3 and other pulsar parameters (such as
the pulsar age), as has been reported in the past. There is no significant
preference of drift direction and the drift direction is not found to be
correlated with pulsar parameters. None of the four complexity parameters

inconsistent with the set of modulation indices of our sample of pulsars.
Therefore none of the models can be ruled out based on our observations. We

and deep X-ray eclipses, with a period of 27,961+/-5 s and a duration of about
1,100+/-100 s, observed during the two consecutive XMM revolutions from August
31 to September 2. No deep eclipses were present during the two consecutive XMM
revolutions from March 28 to April 1, 2004. The spectra during all four
observations are well described with an absorbed power law continuum. While our
fits on the power law index over the four observations yield values that are
consistent with Gamma=1.6-2.0, there appears to be a significant increase in
the column density during the Summer 2004 observations, i.e. the period during
which the eclipses are detected. The intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV
energy range is almost constant with 1.8-2.3 x 10^34 (d_8kpc)^2 erg/s over the

we show that the eclipse period constrains the mass of the assumed
main-sequence secondary star to less than 1.0 M_odot. Therefore, we deduce that
CXOGC J174540.0-290031 is a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Moreover the eclipse
duration constrains the mass of the compact object to less than about 60
M_odot, which is consistent with a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star.
The absence of deep X-ray eclipses during the Spring 2004 observations could be
explained if the centroid of the X-ray emitting region moves from a position on
the orbital plane to a point above the compact object, possibly coincident with
the base of the jet which was detected in radio at this epoch. [Abstract

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) detections from known clusters of galaxies in this
supercluster and for a possible extended SZ decrement due to diffuse warm/hot
gas in the intercluster medium. We measure negative flux values in the
positions of the ten richest clusters in the region. Collectively, this implies
a 3.0-sigma detection of the SZ effect. In the clusters A2061 and A2065 we find
decrements of approximately 2-sigma. Our main result is the detection of two
strong and resolved negative features at -70+-12 mJy/beam (-157+-27 microK) and
-103+-10 mJy/beam (-230+-23 microK), respectively, located in a region with no
known clusters, near the centre of the supercluster. We discuss their possible
origins in terms of primordial CMB anisotropies and/or SZ signals related to
either unknown clusters or to a diffuse extended warm/hot gas distribution. Our
analyses have revealed that a primordial CMB fluctuation is a plausible
explanation for the weaker feature (probability of 37.82%). For the stronger
one, neither primordial CMB (probability of 0.33%) nor SZ can account alone for
its size and total intensity. The most reasonable explanation, then, is a
combination of both primordial CMB and SZ signal. Finally, we explore what
characteristics would be required for a filamentary structure consisting of
warm/hot diffuse gas in order to produce a significant contribution to such a
spot taking into account the constraints set by X-ray data.

Using a fully automated search algorithm, we indentify 14 candidate
microlensing events, three of which are reported here for the first time.
Observations obtained at the Mayall telescope are combined with the INT data to
produce composite lightcurves for these candidates. The results from the survey
are compared with theoretical predictions for the number and distribution of
events. These predictions are based on a Monte Carlo calculation of the
detection efficiency and disk-bulge-halo models for M31. The models provide the
full phase-space distribution functions for the lens and source populations and
are motivated by dynamical and observational considerations. They include
differential extinction and span a wide range of parameter space characterised
primarily by the mass-to-light ratios for the disk and bulge. For most models,
the observed event rate is consistent with the rate predicted for self-lensing
-- a MACHO halo fraction of 30% or higher can be ruled at the 95% confidence
level. The event distribution does show a large near-far asymmetry hinting at a
halo contribution to the microlensing signal. Two candidate events are located
at particularly large projected radii on the far side of the disk. These events
are difficult to explain by self lensing and only somewhat easier to explain by
MACHO lensing. A possibility is that one of these is due to a lens in a giant
stellar stream.

is fortunate as point parity handedness implies almost certainly a high level
of galactic contamination. Mirror reflection parity, on the contrary, is
related to the emergence of a preferred axis, defining the symmetry plane. We
use this technique to make contact with recent claims for an anisotropic
Universe, showing that the detected preferred axis is associated with positive
(even) mirror parity. This feature may be an important clue in identifying the
culprit for this unexpected signal.

what one actually observes are shocked regions with a filling factor of $\sim
1%$. In this framework, up to now, comparisons with observations have been
based on stationary shock models. Here we introduce for the first time the
self-consistent dynamics of such shocks and we show that considering their
properties at different times, i.e. locations, we can reproduce observational
data of the DG Tau microjet. In particular, we can interpret the spatial
behavior of the [SII]6716/6731 and [NII]/[OI]6583/6300 line intensity ratios
adopting a set of physical parameters that yield values of mass loss rates and
magnetic fields consistent with previous estimates. We also obtain the values
of the mean ionization fraction and electron density along the jet, compare
these values with the ones derived from observations using the sulfur doublet
to constrain the electron density (e.g. Bacciotti et al. 1995).

and in view of recent experimental results in micro-gravity during few CNES and
ESA campaigns [9,11]. It is recalled that the Boltzmann's distribution is a
steady solution only when collisions are elastic; hence it is not applicable in
the case of dissipative granular gas. The first experimental case concerns
non-interacting balls in a vibrated cylindrical box, which proves that
rotation-induced dissipation has important consequence: it reduces the
efficient phase space dimension of this billiard-like system from 13-d to 1-d,
since the motion is 1d and quasi-periodic for large enough forcing; the result
remains valid with 2 balls. The second experiment concern the dynamics of
interacting particles in the case of a small number (N= 12,24,36,48) of grains:
The typical speed of a balls is found to vary linearly with the piston speed,
but decreases when the number of balls N increases. The distribution of waiting
times T1 between successive ball-gauge collisions follows an exponential
distribution experimentally, i.e. P(T1)= exp(-T1/To), proving uncorrelated
motions of balls. The amplitude I of the ball-gauge impacts is found to
decrease exponentially p(I)=exp(-I/Io).This is temptatively explained using a
model ""a la Boltzmann"" associated with the notion of ""velostat"", and a second
model is proposed based on dissipation. Experiments show the coupling between
rotation and translation during collisions cannot be neglected, because it
generates efficient dissipation.

neither on the microscopic details of the potential nor on a magnetic flux but
only on the type of non-analyticity. We also argue that a deterministic kicked

the level statistics of a disordered system at the Anderson transition (AT).

opportunities beyond existing carbon nanotube and nanowire systems, has not
been realized. Here we report the synthesis and transport studies of a 1D hole
gas system based on a free-standing germanium/silicon (Ge/Si) core/shell
nanowire heterostructure. Room temperature electrical transport measurements
show clearly hole accumulation in undoped Ge/Si nanowire heterostructures, in
contrast to control experiments on single component nanowires. Low-temperature
studies show well controlled Coulomb blockade oscillations when the Si shell
serves as a tunnel barrier to the hole gas in the Ge channel. Transparent
contacts to the hole gas also have been reproducibly achieved by thermal
annealing. In such devices, we observe conductance quantization at low
temperatures, corresponding to ballistic transport through 1D subbands, where
the measured subband energy spacings agree with calculations for a cylindrical
confinement potential. In addition, we observe a 0.7 structure, which has been
attributed to spontaneous spin polarization, suggesting the universality of
this phenomenon in interacting 1D systems. Lastly, the conductance exhibits
little temperature dependence, consistent with our calculation of reduced
backscattering in this 1D system, and suggests that transport is ballistic even
at room temperature.

causal} if the probability distribution for the fields in any region is
determined solely by physical data in the region's past, i.e. it is independent
of events at space-like separated points. General relativity is manifestly
locally causal, since the fields in a region are completely determined by
physical data in its past. It is natural to ask whether other possible theories
in which the fundamental description of space-time is classical and geometric
-- for instance, hypothetical theories which stochastically couple a classical
spacetime geometry to a quantum field theory of matter -- might also be locally
causal.
  A quantum theory of gravity, on the other hand, should allow the creation of
spacetimes which violate local causality at the macroscopic level. This paper
describes an experiment to test the local causality of spacetime, and hence to
test whether or not gravity behaves as quantum theories of gravity suggest, in
this respect. The experiment will either produce direct evidence that the
gravitational field is not locally causal, and thus weak confirmation of
quantum gravity, or else identify a definite limit to the domain of validity of
quantum theory.

Killing horizon with universal radius $r_0$. After imposing spherical symmetry
and after restriction to the Killing horizon, the metric is quantized employing
the chiral currents formalism. Two ``components of the metric'' are indeed
quantized: The former behaves as an affine scalar field under changes of
coordinates, the latter is instead a proper scalar field. The action of the
symplectic group on both fields is realized in terms of certain horizon
diffeomorphisms. Depending on the choice of the vacuum state, such a
representation is unitary. If the reference state of the scalar field is a
coherent state rather than a vacuum, spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry
arises and the state contains a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this case the
order parameter fixes the actual size of the black hole with respect to $r_0$.
Both the constructed state together with the one associated with the affine
scalar are thermal states (KMS) with respect to Schwarzschild Killing time when
restricted to half horizon. The value of the order parameter fixes the
temperature at the Hawking value as well. As a result, it is found that the
quantum energy and entropy densities coincide with the black hole mass and
entropy, provided the universal parameter $r_0$ is suitably chosen, not
depending on the size of the actual black hole in particular.

perturbative thermalization leading to (non-viscous) Bjorken hydrodynamic
description of heavy ion collisions. These arguments are complimentary to our
more formal argument presented in [hep-ph/0503038]. We argue that the success
of hydrodynamic models in describing the quark-gluon system produced in heavy
ion collisions could only be due to non-perturbative strong coupling effects.
We continue by studying non-perturbative effects in heavy ion collisions at
high energies. We model non-perturbative phenomena by an instanton ensemble. We
show that non-perturbative instanton vacuum fields may significantly contribute
to jet quenching in nuclear collisions. At the same time, the instanton
ensemble contribution to thermalization is likely to be rather weak, leading to
non-perturbative thermalization time comparable to the time of hadronization.
This example illustrates that jet quenching is not necessarily a signal of a
thermalized medium. Indeed, since the instanton models do not capture all the
effects of QCD vacuum (e.g. they do not account for confinement), there may be
other non-perturbative effects facilitating thermalization of the system.

results show that the right power behavior of the hard contribution from the
higher helicity components can only be obtained by fully keeping the $k_T$

wavefunction affects the hard and soft contributions substantially. A model for
the twist-3 wavefunction $\psi_p(x,\mathbf{k_\perp})$ of the pion has been
constructed based on the moment calculation by applying the QCD sum rules,
whose distribution amplitude has a better end-point behavior than that of the
asymptotic one. With this model wavefunction, the twist-3 contributions
including both the usual helicity components ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2=0$) and the
higher helicity components ($\lambda_1+\lambda_2=\pm 1$) to the pion form
factor have been studied within the modified pQCD approach. Our results show
that the twist-3 contribution drops fast and it becomes less than the twist-2
contribution at $Q^2\sim 10GeV^2$. The higher helicity components in the
twist-3 wavefunction will give an extra suppression to the pion form factor.
When all the power contributions, which include higher order in $\alpha_s$,

it is expected that the hard contributions will fit the present experimental

Alternative deviations from tribimaximal mixing may stem from contributions of

of Randall and Sundrum (RS), which offers a solution for the long standing
puzzle of the gauge hierarchy problem, has attracted considerable attention
from both the theoretical and experimental points of view. In the context of
the RS model with gauge bosons and fermions living in the bulk, a novel type of
mechanism has arisen for interpreting the strong mass hierarchy of the Standard
Model fermions. This purely geometrical mechanism is based on a type and flavor
dependent localization of fermions along a warped extra dimension. Here, we
find concrete realizations of this mechanism, reproducing all the present
experimental data on masses and mixings of the entire leptonic sector. We
consider the case of Dirac neutrino masses (due to an additional right handed
neutrino) where the various constraints on RS parameter space are taken into
account. The scenarios, elaborated in this paper, generate the entire lepton
mass hierarchy and mixing, essentially, via the higher-dimensional mechanism,
as the Yukawa coupling dependence is chosen to be minimal. In addition, from
the above mechanism, we predict the typical lepton mixing angle 10^-5 <
sin(theta_13) < 10^-1, a neutrino mass spectrum with normal hierarchy and the
smallest neutrino mass to lie approximately in the range: 10^-11 eV < m_nu_1 <

of Gauss-Bonnet, Gauss-Bonnet-de Sitter and Gauss-Bonnet-anti-de Sitter black
hole spacetimes. The perturbations are considered both in frequency and time
domain. The dependence of the scalar field evolution on the values of the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ is
investigated. For Gauss-Bonnet and Gauss-Bonnet-de Sitter black holes, at
asymptotically late times either power-law or exponential tails dominate, while
for Gauss-Bonnet-anti-de Sitter black hole, the quasinormal modes govern the
scalar field decay at all times. The power-law tails at asymptotically late
times for odd-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes does not depend on $\alpha$,
even though the black hole metric contains $\alpha$ as a new parameter. The
corrections to quasinormal spectrum due to Gauss-Bonnet coupling is not small
and should not be neglected. For the limit of near extremal value of the
(positive) cosmological constant and pure de Sitter and anti-de Sitter modes in
Gauss-Bonnet gravity we have found analytical expressions.

character of the m-reduction procedure to construct appropriate twisted CFT
models, called Twisted Models (TM), which by construction reproduce the Quantum
Hall topological properties at those fillings. Indeed for the Jain plateaux we
find that the different descriptions given in the literature fall into
different sectors of the TM for the torus topology. Other interesting aspects
are explicitly seen for the m=2 non standard filling nu=1/p+1 (the pairing
case) as the merging of non-Abelian statistics or the instability of the TM
model (c=2) versus the Moore-Read one (c=3/2). Furthermore by using Boundary
CFT techniques the presence of localized impurities and/or dissipation is shown
to be closely connected with the twisted sector of the TM, whose presence
assures the consistency of the construction and whose role in describing non

Eulerian coherent structures in a randomly fluctuating ocean -- a jet-like
current and an eddy. Advection of passive tracers in a periodically-driven flow
consisting of a background stream and an eddy (the model inspired by the
phenomenon of topographic eddies over mountains in the ocean and atmosphere) is
analyzed as an example of chaotic particle's scattering and transport. A
numerical analysis reveals a nonattracting chaotic invariant set $\Lambda$ that
determines scattering and trapping of particles from the incoming flow. It is
shown that both the trapping time for particles in the mixing region and the
number of times their trajectories wind around the vortex have hierarchical
fractal structure as functions of the initial particle's coordinates.
Scattering functions are singular on a Cantor set of initial conditions, and
this property should manifest itself by strong fluctuations of quantities
measured in experiments. The Lagrangian structures in our numerical experiments
are shown to be similar to those found in a recent laboratory dye experiment at
Woods Hole. Transport and mixing of passive particles is studied in the
kinematic model inspired by the interaction of a jet current (like the Gulf
Stream or the Kuroshio) with an eddy in a noisy environment. We demonstrate a
non-trivial phenomenon of noise-induced clustering of passive particles and
propose a method to find such clusters in numerical experiments. These clusters
are patches of advected particles which can move together in a random velocity
field for comparatively long time.

where localized coherent structures, embedded in a complex spatiotemporal

of a charged-particle is addressed by considering the criterion of minimum
radiation loss under optimum displacement in variationally referred dynamic
course in between a pair of arbitrarily selected space-like surfaces having
time-like separation. Using the criterion, analysis made by involving a family
of infinitesimally differed paths reveals that for attaining stationary action
of the dynamic course it is necessary to involve orchestrated displacement of
the path family. Dynamics that generally follows from such analysis involves
nonlocally mediated interaction besides the conventional ones. Amidst external
field perturbation it is shown that ubiquitous nonlocal mediation incessantly
attempts optimizing displacement in accomplishing minimum radiation loss. The
mediation involves virtual exchange of quantized energy and momentum of the
interacting field and particle, which in conformity with quantum mechanical
prescription is describable by unitary evolution. Under increasingly high
perturbation, the mediation can boost its defensive effort but up to a critical
limit with stress release predominantly as Larmor radiation relaxation.
Observable acceleration and jerk, and relaxations thereof in the nonstationary
evolution are indeed markers of the defense failure. Recoil from the Larmor
relaxation impedes kinetic energy growth and also imparts shear stress to the
spherically polarized vacuum field of point charge; the transverse stress
release having similitude of Hawking-Unruh radiation. Defending nonlocal field
restrains acceleration runaway and loss of causality. The classically based
ab-initio analysis on nonlocal realisms further proves its versatility in
revealing nonlocally mediated geodesics structure of quantized 4-space with
useful revelations.

above-threshold ionization, high order harmonic generation, and dynamic
stabilization are known to occur. In the nonrelativistic regime and within the
single active electron approximation, these phenomena can be studied with Qprop
in the most rigorous way by solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation
in three spatial dimensions. Because Qprop is optimized for the study of
quantum systems that are spherically symmetric in their initial, unperturbed
configuration, all wavefunctions are expanded in spherical harmonics.
Time-propagation of the wavefunctions is performed using a split-operator
approach. Photoelectron spectra are calculated employing a window-operator
technique. Besides the solution of the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation in
single active electron approximation, Qprop allows to study many-electron
systems via the solution of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations.

values of any operator on a quantum system, by changing only the
data-processing of the measurement outcomes. In particular, an informationally
complete measurement can be used to perform quantum tomography, namely to
estimate the density matrix of the quantum state. The data-processing is
generally nonunique, and can be optimized according to a given criterion. In
this paper we provide the solution of the optimization problem which minimizes
the variance in the estimation. We then consider informationally complete
measurements performed over bipartite quantum systems focusing attention on
universally covariant measurements, and compare their statistical efficiency
when performed either locally or globally on the two systems. Among global
measurements we consider the special case of Bell measurements, which allow to
estimate the expectation of a restricted class of operators. We compare the
variance in the three cases: local, Bell, and unrestricted global--and derive
conditions for the operators to be estimated such that one type of measurement
is more efficient than the other. In particular, we find that for factorized
operators and Bell projectors the Bell measurement always performs better than
the unrestricted global measurement, which in turn outperforms the local one.
For estimation of the matrix elements of the density operator, the relative
performances depend on the basis on which the state is represented, and on the
matrix element being diagonal or off-diagonal, however, with the global
unrestricted measurement generally performing better than the local one.

classically. The set of mathematically consistent joint probability assignments
(``states'') for such measurements is properly larger than the set of
quantum-mechanical mixed states for the Alice-Bob system. It is canonically
isomorphic to the set of positive (not necessarily completely positive) linear
maps Phi from the bounded linear operators on Alice's space to those on Bob's,
for which Tr Phi(I)=1. We review the fact that allowing classical communication
is equivalent to enforcing ``no-instantaneous-signalling'' (``no--influence'')
in the direction opposite the communication. We establish that in the subclass
of ``decomposable'' states, i.e. convex combinations of positive states with
""PTP"" ones whose partial transpose is positive, the extremal states are just
the extremal positive and extremal PTP states. We show that two such states,
shared by the same pair of parties, cannot necessarily be combined as
independent states (their tensor product) if the full set of quantum operations
is allowed locally to each party. We use a framework of ``test spaces'' and
states on these, suited for exhibiting the analogies and deviations of
empirical probabilistic theories from classical probability theory. This leads
to a deeper understanding of analogies between quantum mechanics and Bayesian
probability theory. The existence of a ``most Bayesian'' quantum rule for
updating states after measurement, and its association with the situation when
information on one system is gained by measuring another, is a case of a
general proposition holding for test spaces combined subject to the
no-signalling requirement.

community has been well aware that photon number splitting (PNS) attack by Eve
severely limits the secure key distribution distance in BB84 QKD systems with
Poissonian photon sources. In attempts to solve this problem,
entanglement-based QKD, single-photon based QKD, and entanglement
swapping-based QKD, have been studied in recent years. However, there are many
technological difficulties that must be overcome before these schemes can
become practical systems. Here we report a very simple QKD system, in which
secure keys were generated over >100 km fibre for the first time. We used an
alternative protocol of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) but with a
Poissonian source. We analysed the security of the DPSK protocol and showed
that it is robust even against hybrid attacks including collective PNS attack
over consecutive pulses, intercept-and-resend (I-R) attack and beamsplitting
(BS) attack, because of the non-deterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a
quantum measurement. To implement this protocol, we developed a new detector
for the 1.5 um band based on frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled
lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide followed by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD).
The use of the new detectors increased the sifted key generation rate up to > 1
Mbit/s over 30 km fibre, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the
previous record.

melding quantum mechanics with special relativity. However, it has also long
been known that an alternative first-quantized formulation can be given for
relativistic quantum mechanics, based on the parametrized paths of particles in
spacetime. Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates,
rather than as an evolution parameter, such a spacetime approach has proved
particularly useful in the study of quantum gravity and cosmology. This paper
shows how a spacetime path formalism can be considered to arise naturally from
the fundamental principles of the Born probability rule, superposition, and
Poincar\'e invariance. The resulting formalism can be seen as a foundation for
a number of previous parametrized approaches in the literature, relating, in
particular, ""off-shell"" theories to traditional on-shell quantum field theory.
It reproduces the results of perturbative quantum field theory for free and
interacting particles, but provides intriguing possibilities for a natural
program for regularization and renormalization. Further, an important
consequence of the formalism is that a clear probabilistic interpretation can
be maintained throughout, with a natural reduction to non-relativistic quantum
mechanics.
