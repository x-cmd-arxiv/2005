Upper Scorpius. We obtained images with the Advanced Camera for Surveys/High
Resolution Camera on HST through the F555W (V), F775W (i'), and F850LP (z')
filters. This survey discovered three new binary systems, including one
marginally resolved pair with a projected separation of only 4.9 AU, resulting
in an observed binary fraction of 25+/-14% at separations >4 AU. After
correcting for detection biases assuming a uniform distribution of mass ratios
for q>0.6, the estimated binary fraction is 33+/-17%. The binary fraction is
consistent with that inferred for higher-mass stars in Upper Sco, but the
separation and mass ratio distributions appear to be different. All three
low-mass binary systems in Upper Sco are tight (<18 AU) and of similar mass
(q>0.6), consistent with expectations based on previous multiplicity studies of
brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the field and in open clusters. The
implication is that the distinct separation and mass ratio distributions of
low-mass systems are set in the formation process or at very young ages, rather
than by dynamical disruption of wide systems at ages >5 Myr. Finally, we
combine the survey detection limits with the models of Burrows et al. (1997) to
show that there are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs with masses >10
M_J at projected separations >20 AU, or masses >5 M_J at projected separations
>40 AU orbiting any of the low-mass (0.04-0.10 M_sun) objects in our sample.

demonstrate the utility of this method in measuring halo profiles, galaxy-mass

test this method on an N-body simulation and show that it correctly and
accurately recovers the 3D density and mass profiles of halos. We find no
evidence of problems due to a mass sheet degeneracy in the simulation.
Cross-correlation lensing provides a powerful method for calibrating the

large surveys. It can also be used on large scales to measure and remove the
halo bias and thereby provide a direct measurement of Omega_m * sigma_8.

describes a scenario of dark energy where the equation of state gets across the

method to show that the conventional dark energy models based on single

needs to add extra degrees of freedom for successful quintom model buildings.
There are no singularities or classical instabilities in perturbations of
realistic quintom models and they are potentially distinguishable from the
cosmological constant. Basing on the realistic quintom models in this paper we
provide one way to include the perturbations for dark energy models with

beaming effects being the cause of the observed asymmetry, and suggest this
source has intrinsically asymmetric radio jets. If this is the case, B3

interpreted in terms of cloud structure. The analysis reveals that there are
two kinds of CH in diffuse molecular gas: CN-like CH and CH$^+$-like CH.
Evidence is provided that CO is also associated with CN in diffuse molecular
clouds. Different species are distributed according to gas density in the

in high density gas, but with different dependences on local gas density. Gas
densities for components where CN was detected were inferred from a chemical

millimeter-wave emission. On small scales, the gas density is seen to vary by
factors greater than 5.0 over scales of $\sim$ 10,000 AU. The relationships
between column densities of CO and CH with that of H$_2$ along a line of sight

result in orbital migration of the planet, and are likely to play an important
role in the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. For masses
comparable to those of observed giant extrasolar planets, the interaction with
the disk is strong enough to form a gap, leading to coupled evolution of the
planet and disk on a viscous time scale (Type II migration). Both the existence
of hot Jupiters, and the statistical distribution of observed orbital radii,
are consistent with an important role for Type II migration in the history of
currently observed systems. We discuss the possibility of improving constraints
on migration by including information on the host stars' metallicity, and note
that migration could also form a population of massive planets at large orbital
radii that may be indirectly detected via their influence on debris disks. For
lower mass planets with masses of the order of that of the Earth, surface
density perturbations created by the planet are small, and migration in a
laminar disk is driven by an intrinsic and apparently robust asymmetry between
interior and exterior torques. Analytic and numerical calculations of this Type
I migration are in reasonable accord, and predict rapid orbital decay during
the final stages of the formation of giant planet cores. The difficulty of
reconciling Type I migration with giant planet formation may signal basic
errors in our understanding of protoplanetary disks, core accretion, or both.
We discuss physical effects that might alter Type I behavior, in particular the
possibility that for sufficiently low masses turbulent fluctuations in the gas
surface density dominate the torque, leading to random walk migration of very
low mass bodies.

resolve it into two physically separate components that were previously
described as star clusters in a single galaxy. The primary component is only
\~100 pc in maximum extent, and consists of starburst region surrounded by a
ring-like structure of relatively redder stars. The secondary component is ~50
pc in size and lies at a projected distance of ~80 pc away from the primary,
and is also actively star-forming. We estimate masses ~10^7 M(sol) and ~10^6
M(sol) for the two components, based on their luminosities, with an associated
dynamical timescale for the system of a few Myr. This timescale and the
structure of the components suggests that a collision between them triggered
their starbursts. The spectral energy distributions of both components can be
fitted by the combination of recent (few Myr old) starburst and an evolved
(several Gyr old) underlying stellar population, similar to larger blue compact
dwarf galaxies. This indicates that despite its metal deficiency the object is
not forming its first generation of stars. However, the small sizes and masses
of the two components suggests that HS 0822+3542 represents a dwarf galaxy in
the process of assembling from clumps of stars intermediate in size between
globular clusters and objects previously classified as galaxies. Its relatively
high ratio of neutral gas mass to stellar mass (~1) and high specific star
formation rate, log(SFR/M(sol) = -9.2, suggests that it is still converting

periods for another 8 previously known variables. All red giants redder than
V-I_c=1.8 are variable at the limits of our detection threshold, which
corresponds to delta V ~ 0.1 mag. This colour limit corresponds to a luminosity
log L/L_sun=3.15 and it is considerably below the tip of the RGB at log
L/L_sun=3.35. Linear non-adiabatic models without mass loss on the giant branch
can not reproduce the observed PL laws for the low amplitude pulsators. Models
that have undergone mass loss do reproduce the observed PL relations and they
show that mass loss of the order of 0.3 M_sun occurs along the RGB and AGB. The
linear pulsation periods do not agree well with the observed periods of the
large amplitude Mira variables, which pulsate in the fundamental mode. The
solution to this problem appears to be that the nonlinear pulsation periods in
these low mass stars are considerably shorter than the linear pulsation periods
due to a rearrangement of stellar structure caused by the pulsation. Both
observations and theory show that stars evolve up the RGB and first part of the
AGB pulsating in low order overtone modes, then switch to fundamental mode at
high luminosities.

the GPS source is found in 6 objects out of 33. Three objects are associated
with quasars with core-jet pc-scale morphology, and three are identified with

GPS quasars are likely to be beamed objects with a continuous supply of energy
from the core to the kpc scale. It is also possible that low surface brightness
extended radio emission is present in other GPS quasars but the emission is
below our detection limit due to the high redshifts of the objects. On the
other hand, the CSO/galaxies with extended large scale emission may be
rejuvenated sources where the extended emission is the relic of previous

be constructed and a robust case is made that the progenitor was a red

distribution allows a region in the theoretical HR diagram to be determined
which must contain the progenitor star. The initial mass of the star is
constrained to be M(ZAMS)=9+3/-2 M_solar, which is very similar to the
identified progenitor of the type II-P SN 2003gd, and also consistent with
upper mass limits placed on five other similar SNe. The upper limit in the deep

that the progenitor was a significantly higher mass object enshrouded in a dust
cocoon before core-collapse. This is further evidence that the trend for type

study. Thanks to its intermediate redshift (z=0.183) its mass distribution can
be reconstructed using numerous methods including gravitational lensing, galaxy
kinematics and X-ray imaging. The methods used to yield conflicting mass
estimates in the past and recently the cluster mass distribution has been
claimed to be in conflict with standard CDM scenarios due to rather large
concentration and steep mass profile obtained from detailed studies of
Broadhurst et al. using lensing. By studying in detail the kinematics of about
200 galaxies with measured redshifts in the vicinity of the cluster we show
that the cluster is probably surrounded by a few structures, quite distant from
each other, but aligned along the line of sight. We support our arguments by
referring to cosmological N-body simulations and showing explicitly that
distant, non-interacting haloes can produce entangled multi-peak line-of-sight
velocity distributions similar to that in A1689. We conclude that it is
difficult to estimate the cluster mass reliably from galaxy kinematics, but the
value we obtain after applying a simple cut-off in velocity agrees roughly with
the mass estimated from lensing. The complicated mass distribution around the
cluster may however increase the uncertainty in the determination of the
density profile shape obtained with weak lensing.

(both centered at RA ~ 5.5 h, dec ~ -45 deg) and a survey of ~ 300 square
degrees across the Galactic plane at RA ~ 9.1 h, dec ~ -47 deg. All three
surveys were carried out in three wide frequency bands centered at 145, 245 and
345 GHz, with an angular resolution of ~ 10'. The 145 GHz maps of Stokes I are
dominated by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy, which is
mapped with high signal to noise ratio. The measured anisotropy pattern is
consistent with the pattern measured in the same region by BOOMERanG-98 and by
WMAP. The 145 GHz maps of Stokes Q and U provide a robust statistical detection
of polarization of the CMB when subjected to a power spectrum analysis. This
amplitude of the polarization is consistent with that of the CMB in the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario. At 145 GHz, in the CMB surveys, the
intensity and polarization of the astrophysical foregrounds are found to be
negligible with respect to the cosmological signal. At 245 and 345 GHz we
detect ISD emission correlated to the 3000 GHz IRAS/DIRBE maps, and give upper
limits for any other non-CMB component. We also present intensity maps of the

exhibit a steeper slope ~0.15 days after the burst, indicative of a jet break.
This jet break time combined with the total gamma-ray energy of the burst
constrains the opening angle of the jet to be 3.2 degrees. We derive an
empirical `time-lag' redshift from the BAT data of z_hat = 0.69 +/- 0.02, in
good agreement with the spectroscopic redshift of 0.61.
  Prior to the jet break, the X-ray data can be modelled by a simple power law
with index alpha = -1.2. However after 300 s the X-ray flux brightens by about
30% compared to the power-law fit. The optical/UV data have a more complex
decay, with evidence of a rapidly falling reverse shock component that
dominates in the first minute or so, giving way to a flatter forward shock
component at later times.
  The multiwavelength X-ray/UV/Optical spectrum of the afterglow shows evidence
for migration of the electron cooling frequency through the optical range

not dense. At the dense limit of gas the interaction of effective (coupled with
the statistical magnetic field) spins of bosons leads to the increasing of
their fluctuations, which destroy the coupling. An experimental phase diagram

superconducting state might strengthen the possible quadratic striction in the
sample and the phase transition of bosons into Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),
which is responsible for the superconductivity (SC), is not second order, but
first, close to second one. According this treatment the pseudogap regime is
the region of meta stable bosons, which are out of the BEC. At the pseudogap
boundary, E_g, the bosons finally undergo the phase transition into fermions.

the link nature of both derivatives and supercharges. Superfields are

ratio between the strong and electromagnetic interaction coupling constants at
Extremely Low Energy (ELE). Based on the experimental data, this relation has
been extended for the weak and gravitational interactions, too. Thus, a mass
relation has been found, according to which the rest mass of the Lightest Free
Massive Stable Particle (LFMSP), acted upon by a particular interaction, is
proportional to the coupling constant of the respective interaction at ELE. On
the basis of this mass relation, the electron neutrino and graviton masses have
been approximately estimated to 2.1x10^(-4) eV/c^2 and 2.3x10^(-34) eV/c^2,
respectively. The last value is of the order of the magnitude of hbar*H/c^2,
where H is the Hubble constant and hbar is the reduced Planck constant. It is

collectively call them stringy cold dark matter. These couplings are
non-universal which results in an interesting dynamics for a rolling dilaton.
Initially, its potential can track radiation and matter while beginning to
dominate the dynamics recently, triggering a phase of acceleration. This
scenario can be realized as long as the dilaton also couples strongly to some
heavy modes. We furnish examples of such modes. We provide analytical and

surface in finite basin in presence of gravity. Wave Turbulence (WT) is a
theory derived for describing statistics of weakly nonlinear waves in the
infinite basin limit. Its formal applicability condition on the minimal size of
the computational basin is impossible to satisfy in present numerical
simulations, and the number of wave resonances is significantly depleted due to
the wavenumber discreteness. The goal of this paper will be to examine which WT
predictions survive in such discrete systems with depleted resonances and which
properties arise specifically due to the discreteness effects. As in
\cite{DKZ,onorato,naoto}, our results for the wave spectrum agree with the
Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum predicted within WT. We also go beyond finding the
spectra and compute probability density function (PDF) of the wave amplitudes
and observe an anomalously large, with respect to Gaussian, probability of
strong waves which is consistent with recent theory \cite{clnp,cln}. Using a
simple model for quasi-resonances we predict an effect arising purely due to
discreteness: existence of a threshold wave intensity above which turbulent
cascade develops and proceeds to arbitrarily small scales. Numerically, we
observe that the energy cascade is very ``bursty'' in time and is somewhat
similar to sporadic sandpile avalanches. We explain this as a cycle: a cascade
arrest due to discreteness leads to accumulation of energy near the forcing
scale which, in turn, leads to widening of the nonlinear resonance and,
therefore, triggering of the cascade draining the turbulence levels and
returning the system to the beginning of the cycle. ~

empirical information is used to effectively identify and eliminate from
further consideration parts of the line where the hazard rate is clearly
increasing; and to confine subsequent attention only to those parts that
remain. This produces a test with greater apparent power, without the excessive
conservatism of exponential-based tests. Our approach to calibration borrows
from ideas used in certain tests for unimodality of a density, in that a
bandwidth is increased until a distribution with the desired properties is
obtained. However, the test statistic does not involve any smoothing, and is,
in fact, based directly on an assessment of convexity of the distribution
function, using the conventional empirical distribution. The test is shown to
have optimal power properties in difficult cases, where it is called upon to
detect a small departure, in the form of a bump, from monotonicity. More
general theoretical properties of the test and its numerical performance are

The usual approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is to restrict
attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate (FWER), the
probability of even one false rejection. In many applications, particularly if
s is large, one might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection
provided the number of such cases is controlled, thereby increasing the ability
of the procedure to detect false null hypotheses. This suggests replacing
control of the FWER by controlling the probability of k or more false
rejections, which we call the k-FWER. We derive both single-step and stepdown
procedures that control the k-FWER, without making any assumptions concerning
the dependence structure of the p-values of the individual tests. In
particular, we derive a stepdown procedure that is quite simple to apply, and
prove that it cannot be improved without violation of control of the k-FWER. We
also consider the false discovery proportion (FDP) defined by the number of
false rejections divided by the total number of rejections (defined to be 0 if
there are no rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and
Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289-300] controls E(FDP).
Here, we construct methods such that, for any \gamma and \alpha,
P{FDP>\gamma}\le\alpha. Two stepdown methods are proposed. The first holds
under mild conditions on the dependence structure of p-values, while the second
is more conservative but holds without any dependence assumptions.

to scene interpretation in which there are a great many possible explanations
for the data, one (``background'') is statistically dominant, and it is
imperative to restrict intensive computation to genuinely ambiguous regions.
The focus here is then on pattern filtering: Given a large set Y of possible
patterns or explanations, narrow down the true one Y to a small (random) subset
\hat Y\subsetY of ``detected'' patterns to be subjected to further, more
intense, processing. To this end, we consider a family of hypothesis tests for
Y\in A versus the nonspecific alternatives Y\in A^c. Each test has null type I
error and the candidate sets A\subsetY are arranged in a hierarchy of nested
partitions. These tests are then characterized by scope (|A|), power (or type
II error) and algorithmic cost. We consider sequential testing strategies in
which decisions are made iteratively, based on past outcomes, about which test
to perform next and when to stop testing. The set \hat Y is then taken to be
the set of patterns that have not been ruled out by the tests performed. The
total cost of a strategy is the sum of the ``testing cost'' and the
``postprocessing cost'' (proportional to |\hat Y|) and the corresponding
optimization problem is analyzed.

This offers a smooth choice between the full and the additive model. As a
byproduct, this penalty leads to a regularization in sparse regions. If the
additive model does not hold, a small penalty introduces an additional bias
compared to the full model which is compensated by the reduced bias due to
using smaller bandwidths. For increasing penalties, this estimator converges to
the additive smooth backfitting estimator of Mammen, Linton and Nielsen [Ann.

the same first-order asymptotic properties that it would enjoy if \theta were
known. The proposed method is illustrated using both simulated and real-data
examples, showing its effectiveness for both independent datasets and data from
time series. Numerical work corroborates the theoretical result that \theta can
be estimated particularly accurately.

are in general two spectral fluxes, one associated with each conserved
quantity. We derive here an inequality comparing the relative magnitudes of the
``energy'' and ``enstrophy'' fluxes for finite or infinitesimal dissipations,
and for hyper or hypo viscosities. When this inequality is satisfied, as is the
case of 2D turbulence,where the energy flux contribution to the energy spectrum
is small, the subdominant part will be effectively hidden. In sQG turbulence,
it is shown that the opposite is true: the downscale energy flux becomes the
dominant contribution to the energy spectrum. A combination of these two
behaviors appears to be the case in 2-layer QG turbulence, depending on the
baroclinicity of the system.

distribution, several models have been proposed by applying principles of
statistical mechanics. These models share some characteristics, such as
consisting of a group of individual agents, a pile of money and a specific
trading rule. Whatever the trading rule is, the most noteworthy fact is that
money is always transferred from one agent to another in the transferring
process. So we call them money transfer models. Besides explaining income and
wealth distributions, money transfer models can also be applied to other
disciplines. In this paper we summarize these areas as statistical
distribution, economic mobility, transfer rate and money creation. First, money
distribution (or income distribution) can be exhibited by recording the money
stock (flow). Second, the economic mobility can be shown by tracing the change
in wealth or income over time for each agent. Third, the transfer rate of money
and its determinants can be analyzed by tracing the transferring process of
each one unit of money. Finally, money creation process can also be
investigated by permitting agents go into debts. Some future extensions to
these models are anticipated to be structural improvement and generalized

money transfer here is a kind of Poisson process. But when the saving rate is
set diversely, the holding time distribution follows a power law. The velocity
can also be deduced from a typical individual's optimal choice. In this way, an
approach for building the micro-foundation of velocity is provided. In order to
expose the dynamic mechanism behind the distribution in microscope, we examined
the mobility by collecting the time series of agents' rank and measured it by
employing an index raised by economists. In the model with uniform saving rate,
the higher saving rate, the slower agents moves in the economy. Meanwhile, all
of the agents have the same chance to be the rich. However, it is not the case
in the model with diverse saving rate, where the assumed economy falls into
stratification. The volatility distribution of the agents' ranks are also
demonstrated to distinguish the differences among these models.

industrial structure. The edges from consumer to producer represent the choices
of the consumer for the final products and the degree of producer can represent
its market share. So the size distribution of firms can be characterized by
producer's degree distribution. The probability for a producer receiving a new
consumption is determined by its competency described by initial attractiveness
and the self-reinforcing mechanism in the competition described by preferential
attachment. The cases with constant total consumption and with growing market
are studied. The following results are obtained: 1, Without market growth and a
uniform initial attractiveness $a$, the final distribution of firm sizes is
Gamma distribution for $a>1$ and is exponential for $a=1$. If $a<1$, the
distribution is power in small size and exponential in upper tail; 2, For a
growing market, the size distribution of firms obeys the power law. The
exponent is affected by the market growth and the initial attractiveness of the
firms.

mostly driven by gene duplications, deletions, and sequence modifications of
existing proteins. Indirect information about relative rates and other
intrinsic parameters of these three basic processes is contained in the
proteome-wide distribution of sequence identities of pairs of paralogous
proteins. We introduce a simple mathematical framework based on a stochastic
birth-and-death model that allows one to extract some of this information and
apply it to the set of all pairs of paralogous proteins in seven model
organisms. It was found that the histogram of sequence identities p generated
by an all-to-all alignment of all protein sequences encoded in a genome is well
fitted with a power-law form ~p^(-gamma) with the value of the exponent gamma
around 4 for the majority of organisms used in this study. This implies that
the intra-protein variability of substitution rates is best described by the
Gamma-distribution with the exponent alpha ~ 0.33. We separately measure the
short-term (``raw'') duplication and deletion rates r*_dup, r*_del which
include gene copies that will be removed soon after the duplication event and
their dramatically reduced long-term counterparts r_dup, r_del. Systematic
trends of each of the four duplication/deletion rates with the total number of
genes in the genome were analyzed. All but the deletion rate of recent
duplicates r*_del were shown to systematically increase with N_genes.
Abnormally flat shapes of sequence identity histograms observed for yeast and
human are consistent with lineages leading to these organisms undergoing one or
more whole-genome duplications.

are generally smaller at low than at high latitudes. However, doubts as to the
generality of the rule have been expressed, because studies providing evidence
against the rule are more numerous than those in support of it. In groups for
which support has been provided, the trend of increasing latitudinal ranges
with latitude is restricted to or at least most distinct at high latitudes,
suggesting that the effect may be a local phenomenon, for example the result of
glaciations. Here we test the rule using two models, a simple one-dimensional
one with a fixed number of animals expanding in a northern or southerly
direction only, and the evolutionary/ecological Chowdhury model using birth,
ageing, death, mutation, speciation, prey-predator relations and food levels.
Simulations with both models gave results contradicting Rapoport's rule. In the
first, latitudinal ranges were roughly independent of latitude, in the second,
latitudinal ranges were greatest at low latitudes, as also shown empirically
for some well studied groups of animals.

particle moving in a square well under the influence of a piece-wise constant
PT-symmetric potential. Upon discretizing the configuration space, the system
is decribed by a matrix of dimension three. It turns out not to be
diagonalizable for a critical strength of the interaction, also indicated by
the transition of two real into a pair of complex energy eigenvalues. The
systems develops a three-fold degenerate eigenvalue, and two of the three
eigenfunctions disappear at this exceptional point, giving a difference between
the algebraic and geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue equal to two.

the mean (b_{1}) of the Bell-CHSH observable (B). This model was extended by
Rajagopal by incorporating the dispersion (\sigma_{1}^2) of the observable, and
by Canosa and Rossignoli, by generalizing the observable (B_{\alpha}). We
further extend the Horodecki one-parameter model in both these manners,
obtaining a three-parameter (b_{1},\sigma_{1}^2,\alpha) two-qubit model, for
which we find a highly interesting/intricate continuum (-\infty < \alpha <
\infty) of Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) separability probabilities -- in which, the
golden ratio is featured. Our model can be contrasted with the three-parameter
(b_{q}, \sigma_{q}^2,q) one of Abe and Rajagopal, which employs a
q(Tsallis)-parameter rather than $\alpha$, and has simply q-invariant HS
separability probabilities of 1/2. Our results emerge in a study initially
focused on embedding certain information metrics over the two-level quantum
systems into a q-framework. We find evidence that Srednicki's recently-stated
biasedness criterion for noninformative priors yields rankings of priors fully
consistent with an information-theoretic test of Clarke, previously applied to
quantum systems by Slater.
