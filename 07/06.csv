sources of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). If the central engines of the huge
energy release are accreting relic black holes (BHs) of such mergers, it is
important to understand how the properties of the BH-torus systems, in
particular disc masses and mass and rotation rate of the compact remnant, are
linked to the characterizing parameters of the NS binaries. For this purpose we
present relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with
conformally flat approximation of the Einstein field equations and a physical,
non-zero temperature equation of state. Thick disc formation is highlighted as
a dynamical process caused by angular momentum transfer through tidal torques
during the merging process of asymmetric systems or in the rapidly spinning
triaxial post-merger object. Our simulations support the possibility that the
first well-localized short and hard GRBs 050509b, 050709, 050724, 050813 have
originated from NS merger events and are powered by neutrino-antineutrino
annihilation around a relic BH-torus system. Using model parameters based on
this assumption, we show that the measured GRB energies and durations lead to
estimates for the accreted masses and BH mass accretion rates which are
compatible with theoretical expectations. In particular, the low energy output
and short duration of GRB 050509b set a very strict upper limit of less than
100 ms for the time interval after the merging until the merger remnant has
collapsed to a BH, leaving an accretion torus with a small mass of only about
0.01 solar masses. This favors a (nearly) symmetric NS+NS binary with a typical
mass as progenitor system.

extended blackbody radiator will scale in a predictable way if all parts of the
body change in temperature by the same factor $X$, such that $ L^\prime(\nu) =
X^3L(\nu/X) $. This should for example apply to accretion disks around black
holes, where $X$ is relative accretion rate, or external heating rate, but will
not apply to changes in black hole mass. I summarise evidence that AGN
optical-UV SEDs become progressively redder with decreasing luminosity, and
show that the trend in colour versus luminosity shown by Mushotzky and Wandel
(1989) is matched extremely well by taking a template high-luminosity SED and
scaling it in the manner described above. This agreement is striking because it
involves {\em no adjustable parameters}. The agreement breaks down at low
luminosities because of stellar contamination and reddening. I then consider
the colour changes of an individual AGN (NGC 5548) during luminosity changes,
which according to the popular X-ray reprocessing model, should follow the
scaling law well. However the observed changes are clearly {\em not} consistent
with the simple scaling prediction. Instead, these colour changes are quite
well explained by the mixing of a constant red component and variable blue
component. Overall, there is then strong support for the ideas (i) that AGN
optical-UV SEDs arise from accretion discs, (ii) that accretion rate plays a
significant role in the very large range of luminosity seen in AGN, and (ii)
that the inner regions of AGN vary independently of the outer accretion disc.

temperature to the gas kinetic temperature via scattering in the Lyman-alpha
resonance [the Wouthuysen-Field (WF) effect]. By establishing an HI spin
temperature different from the temperature of the CMB, the WF effect should
allow observations of HI during the reionization epoch in the redshifted 21 cm
line. This paper investigates four mechanisms that can affect the strength of
the WF effect that were not previously considered: (1) Photons redshifting into
the HI Lyman resonances may excite an H atom and result in a radiative cascade
terminating in two-photon 2s->1s emission, rather than always degrading to
Lyman-alpha as usually assumed. (2) The fine structure of the Lyman-alpha
resonance alters the photon frequency distribution and leads to a suppression
of the scattering rate. (3) The spin-flip scatterings change the frequency of
the photon and cause the photon spectrum to relax not to the kinetic
temperature of the gas but to a temperature between the kinetic and spin
temperatures, effectively reducing the strength of the Wouthuysen-Field
coupling. (4) Near line centre, a photon can change its frequency by several
times the line width in a single scattering event, thus potentially
invalidating the usual calculation of the Lyman-alpha spectral distortion based
on the diffusion approximation. It is shown that (1) suppresses the WF coupling
strength by a factor of up to ~2, while (2) and (3) are important only at low
kinetic temperatures. Effect (4) has a <=3% effect for kinetic temperatures
T_k>=2K. If the pre-reionization IGM was efficiently heated by X-rays, only
effect (1) is important. Fitting formulae are provided for the range of T_k>=2K

galaxies brighter than r=19 with photometric redshifts (divided into colour and
luminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. We search for
and identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to a
spurious detection. These include systematic shear that leads to a slight
spurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (due
to contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens source
pairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. We develop methods that allow us to
remove these contaminants to the signal. We split the analysis into blue
(spiral) and red (elliptical) galaxies. Assuming Gaussian errors as in previous
work and a power-law profile, we find f_h=e_h/e_g=0.1+/-0.06 for red galaxies
and -0.8+/-0.4 for blue galaxies using 20-300 kpc/h, averaged over luminosity.
Inclusion of the more realistic non-Gaussian error distributions and of the NFW
density profile (which predicts much smaller ellipticity of the shear for
scales above the scale radius) yields 0.60+/-0.38 for ellipticals and
-1.4+1.7-2.0 for spirals. While there is no concrete detection of alignment in
either case, there is a suggestion in the data of a positive alignment in the
brightest lens sample of ellipticals. Our results appear to be mildly
inconsistent with a previously reported detection by Hoekstra et al. (2004),

is real or a consequence of differences in the lens galaxy samples used and

this is interpreted as a sign that the mechanism responsible for the DE is

DE with a potential phantom phase near our time. In the literature there is a
plethora of dynamical models trying to describe this behavior. Here we show
that the simplest option, namely a model with a variable cosmological term,

enrichment coupled to numerical simulations that track the orbital evolution

investigation is the observed systematic difference between the chemical
abundances of stars in satellite galaxies and those in the Milky Way halo.
Specifically, for the same [Fe/H] values, stars in neighboring satellite
galaxies display significantly lower [alpha/Fe] ratios than stars in the halo.
  We find that the observed chemical abundance patterns are a natural outcome
of the process of hierarchical assembly of the Galaxy. This result follows
because the stellar halo in this context is built up from satellite galaxies
accreted early on (more than 8-9 Gyr ago) and enriched in alpha-elements
produced in Type II supernovae. In contrast, satellites which survive today are
typically accreted late (within the last 4-5 Gyr) with nearly solar [alpha/Fe]
values as a result of contributions from both Type II and Type Ia supernovae.
We use our model to investigate the abundance distribution functions (using
both [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] ratios) for stars in the halo and in surviving
satellites. Our results suggest that the shapes and peaks in the abundance
distribution functions provide a direct probe of the accretion histories of
galaxies.

spectra of 2MASSW J1207334-393254 (M8), a likely member of the nearby
8-million-year-old TW Hydrae association. These spectra show a variety of
emission lines that are commonly seen in classical T Tauri stars. Halpha line
in particular shows dramatic changes in shape and intensity in our dataset,
both on timescales of several weeks and several hours. In spectra from
late-January, the line is relatively weak and only slightly asymmetric. Spectra
from mid- and late-March show intense, broad and asymmetric Halpha emission,
indicative of on-going disk accretion. We estimate that the accretion rate
could have changed by a factor of 5-10 over ~6 weeks in this brown dwarf. March
spectra also reveal significant `quasi-periodic' changes in the Halpha line
profile over the course of a night, from clearly double-peaked to nearly
symmetric. These nightly profile changes, roughly consistent with the brown
dwarf's rotation period, could be the result of a redshifted absorption feature
coming into and out of our line of sight; when the profile is double-peaked we
may be looking into an accretion column, flowing from the inner disk edge on to
the central object, indicating that the accretion is probably channelled along
the magnetic field lines. Our findings provide strong support for the
magnetospheric accretion scenario, and thus for the existence of large-scale
magnetic fields, in the sub-stellar regime (abridged).

suitable to detecting magnetic chemically peculiar (CP) stars with high

CP objects. Furthermore, the groups of (metal-weak) lambda Bootis, as well as
classical Be/shell stars, can be successfully investigated. In addition, we
also analyzed the behaviour of supergiants (luminosity class I and II). On the

luminous secondary lobes. Within the scenario of a merger between two galaxies,
each hosting a supermassive black hole in its center, this structure has been
explained before: As the smaller galaxy spirals towards the common center, it
releases gas to the ISM of the larger active galaxy. The ram pressure of this
streaming gas will bend the lobes of the pre-merger jet into a Z-shape. After
the black holes have merged the jet propagates in a new direction that is
aligned with the angular momentum of the binary black hole. In this article we
deproject the pre- and post-merger jets. Taking into account the expected
angles between the jet pairs and with the assumption that their directions are
uncorrelated, we show that one of three possible orientations of the jets with
respect to the line of sight is more likely than the others. This actually
depends on the distance where the bending occurs. Another result of our
deprojection is that the streaming gas bends the jet into a Z-shape in a range
between about 30 and 100 kpc distance to the center of the primary galaxy. We
confirm this finding by comparing our predictions for the properties of the
rotational velocity field and its radius with observations and numerical
simulations of merging galaxies. Thus our results support the merger scenario
as explanation for X- and Z-shaped radio galaxies with the jet pointing along
the former axis of orbital angular momentum of the binary.

with accurate parallax measurements from the Hipparcos satellite were divided
into Si, SiCr and SrCrEu subgroups based on classification resolution data from
the literature. Primarily, it was investigated if the CP2 phenomenon occurs at
very early stages of the stellar evolution, significantly before these stars
reach 30% of their life-time on the main sequence. This result is especially
important for theories dealing with stellar dynamos, angular momentum loss
during the pre- as well as main sequence and stellar evolutionary codes for CP2
stars. For the calibration of the chosen sample, the well-developed framework
of the Geneva 7-color and Stromgren uvbybeta photometric system was used. We
are able to show that the CP2 phenomenon occurs continuously at the zero age
main sequence for masses between 1.5 and 4.5M(sun}. The magnetic field
strengths do not vary significantly during the evolution towards the terminal
age main sequence. Only the effective temperature and magnetic field strength
seem to determine the kind of peculiarity for those stars. We found several
effects during the evolution of CP2 stars at the main sequence, i.e. there are
two ""critical"" temperatures where severe changes take place. There is a
transition between Si, SiCr and SrCrEu stars at 10000K whereas a significant
decrease to almost zero of evolved SrCrEu objects with masses below 2.25M(sun)

abundance (grad_Z [Mg/Fe]=0.06\pm 0.02 kpc^{-1}), which can be present in the

The large spread in relative magnesium abundance (-0.3<[Mg/Fe]<0.5) in the

interstellar clouds that interacted weakly with the matter of a single

smaller perigalactic orbital radii and the higher eccentricities for

(Tc=80K) we find that both the bonding and antibonding sheets of the Fermi

find that the antibonding sheet becomes electron-like. This change does not
directly affect the critical temperature and therefore the superconductivity.
However, since similar observations of the change of the topology of the Fermi

this doping value is considerably lower than that for the single layer

WC (AFMWC) without IC. Our central finding is that a FMWC can be pinned more
strongly due to the presence of IC. One specific mechanism is through the
disorder induced interlayer tunneling, which effectively manifests as an extra
pinning in a FMWC. We also construct a general ""effective disorder"" model and
effective pinning Hamiltonian for the case of FMWC and AFMWC respectively.
Under this framework, pinning in the presence of IC involves
\textit{interlayer} spatial correlation of disorder in addition to intralayer
correlation, leading to \textit{enhanced} pinning in the FMWC. The pinning mode
frequency (\wpk) of a FMWC is found to decease with the effective layer
separation, whereas for an AFMWC the opposite behavior is expected. An abrupt
drop of \wpk is predicted at a transition from a FMWC to AFMWC. Possible
effects of in-plane magnetic fields and finite temperatures are addressed.
Finally we discuss some other possible ramifications of the FMWC as an
electronic supersolid-like phase.

numerical techniques such as Finite Differences or Finite Elements for the

Cellular Automata (LGCA) for computer graphics applications. LGCA are discrete
models based on point particles that move on a lattice, according to suitable

two sets of variables. The first set consist of one tensorial (the induced
metric $g_{ij}$), one vectorial ($M^{i}$) and one scalar ($M$) dynamical
quantity, all defined on the s-space. Their time evolutions are related to the
second fundamental form (the extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$), the normal
fundamental form ($\mathcal{K}^{i}$) and normal fundamental scalar
($\mathcal{K}$), respectively. The non-dynamical set of variables is given by
the lapse function and the shift vector, which however has one component less.
The missing component is due to the externally imposed constraint, which states
that physical trajectories are confined to the (s+1)-dimensional brane. The
pair of dynamical variables ($g_{ij}$, $K_{ij}$), well-known from the

which generates the spectrum. All channels that are required by the existence

is predicted at mass 2.78 GeV. It couples strongly to the (bar D_s N),(bar D
Lambda),(bar D Sigma) channels. A further charm minus-one system is predicted
at mass 2.84 GeV as a result of (bar D_s Lambda), (bar D Xi) interactions. We
suggest the existence of strongly bound crypto-exotic baryons, which contain a
charm-anti-charm pair. Such states are narrow since they can decay only via
OZI-violating processes. A narrow nucleon resonance is found at mass 3.52 GeV.
It is a coupled-channel bound state of the (eta_c N), (bar D Sigma_c) system,
which decays dominantly into the (eta' N) channel. Furthermore two isospin
singlet hyperon states at mass 3.23 GeV and 3.58 GeV are observed as a
consequence of coupled-channel interactions of the (bar D_s Lambda_c), (bar D
Xi_c) and (eta_c Lambda),(bar D Xi_c') states. Most striking is the small width
of about 1 MeV of the lower state. The upper state may be significantly broader
due to a strong coupling to the (eta' Lambda) state. The two so far observed
s-wave baryons with charm one are recovered. We argue that the Lambda_c(2880)

"hep-th/0507045","Tarun Biswas","Tarun Biswas","Quantum Field Theory without Infinite Renormalization","8 pages, uses pictex",,,,"hep-th",,"  Although Quantum field theory has been very successful in explaining
experiment, there are two aspects of the theory that remain quite troubling.
One is the no-interaction result proved in Haag's theorem. The other is the
existence of infinite perturbation expansion terms that need to be absorbed
into theoretically unknown but experimentally measurable quantities like charge
and mass -- i.e. renormalization. Here it will be shown that the two problems
may be related. A ""natural"" method of eliminating the renormalization problem
also sidesteps Haag's theorem automatically. Existing renormalization schemes
can at best be considered a temporary fix as perturbation theory assumes
expansion terms to be ""small"" -- and infinite terms are definitely not so (even
if they are renormalized away). String theories may be expected to help the
situation because the infinities can be traced to the point-nature of
particles. However, string theories have their own problems arising from the
extra space dimensions required. Here a more directly physical remedy is
suggested. Particles are modeled as extended objects (like strings). But,
unlike strings, they are composites of a finite number of constituents each of
which resides in the normal 4-dimensional space-time. The constituents are
bound together by a manifestly covariant confining potential. This approach no
longer requires infinite renormalizations. At the same time it sidesteps the
no-interaction result proved in Haag's theorem.

functorial way a vector bundle v(M) on the Tate curve $E_q:={\mathbb

the indecomposable vector bundles on the complex Tate curve. Linear
q-difference equations are also studied in positive characteristic in order to
derive Atiyah's results for elliptic curves for which the j-invariant is not
algebraic over ${\mathbb F}_p$. A universal difference ring and a universal
formal difference Galois group are introduced. Part of the difference Galois
group has an interpretation as `Stokes matrices', the above moduli space is the
algebraic tool to compute it. It is possible to provide the vector bundle v(M)
on E_q, corresponding to a difference module M over K, with a connection
$\nabla_M$. If M is regular singular, then $\nabla_M$ is essentially determined
by the absense of singularities and `unit circle monodromy'. More precisely,
the monodromy of the connection $(v(M),\nabla_M)$ coincides with the action of
two topological generators of the universal regular singular difference Galois
group. For irregular difference modules, $\nabla_M$ will have singularities and
there are various Tannakian choices for $M\mapsto (v(M),\nabla_M)$. Explicit
computations are difficult, especially for the case of non integer slopes.

instead the notion of identity arrow is weakened -- these are tentatively
called fair categories. The approach is simplicial in spirit, but the usual
simplicial category $\Delta$ is replaced by a certain `fat' delta of `coloured
ordinals', where the degeneracy maps are only up to homotopy. The first part of
this exposition is aimed at a broad mathematical readership and contains also a
brief introduction to simplicial viewpoints on higher categories in general. It
is explained how the definition of fair $n$-category is almost forced upon us
by three standard ideas.
  The second part states some basic results about fair categories, and give
examples. The category of fair 2-categories is shown to be equivalent to the
category of bicategories with strict composition law. Fair 3-categories
correspond to tricategories with strict composition laws. The main motivation
for the theory is Simpson's weak-unit conjecture according to which
$n$-groupoids with strict composition laws and weak units should model all
homotopy $n$-types. A proof of a version of this conjecture in dimension 3 is
announced, obtained in joint work with A. Joyal. Technical details and a fuller

scheme, even extended to density dependent vertices. Small amplitude
oscillations are analysed using the Relativistic Vlasov (RV) approach, i.e.
neglecting nucleon collision terms. The time evolution of the isoscalar
monopole moment and isovector dipole moment and the corresponding Fourier power
spectra are discussed. In the case of ^{208}Pb we study in detail the
dependence of the monopole response on the effective mass and symmetry energy
at saturation given by the used covariant effective interaction. We show that a
reduced m^* and a larger a_4 can compensate the effect on the ISGMR energy
centroid of a much larger compressibility modulus K_{nm}. This result is
important in order to overcome the conflicting determination of the nuclear
compressibility between non-relativistic and relativistic effective
interactions. For the symmetry energy dynamical effects, we carefully analyze
the influence of the inclusion of an effective isovector scalar channel,
  \delta-meson field, with constant and density dependent couplings. We show
the relevance of the $slope$ (or pressure) of the symmetry energy at saturation
on the ISGMR and IVGDR modes for neutron-rich systems. Density dependent
vertices are not much affecting our conclusions. Following as a guidance some
extended dispersion relations in nuclear matter, we see two main reasons for
that, the smoothness of the density dependences around saturation and the
presence of compensation effects coming from rearrangement terms.

frequency of the order of the orbital frequency and causes a gyroscopic torque.
We explore a consequence of this multiscale solution, i.e; the resonance
condition that the angular momentum of the stiff spinning should rotate exactly
at the orbital frequency. The resonant orbits turn out to have angular momenta
that are integer multiples of Planck's constant to a good approximation. Among

Electromagnetism can not be geometrized in the framework of Riemannian

that electromagnetic field is a source for gravitational field. This theory is
formulated in four dimensional spacetime and does not contain additional

problem of the capacity of a quantum channel assisted by a ""friendly (channel)
environment"" that can locally measure and communicate classical messages to the
receiver.
  Previous work [quant-ph/0505038] has yielded a capacity formula for the
quantum capacity under this kind of help from the environment. Here we study
the problem of the environment-assisted classical capacity, which exhibits a
somewhat richer structure (at least, it seems to be the harder problem). There
are several, presumably inequivalent, models of the permitted local operations
and classical communications between receiver and environment: one-way,
arbitrary, separable and PPT POVMs. In all these models, the task of decoding a
message amounts to discriminating a set of possibly entangled states between
the two receivers, by a class of operations under some sort of locality
constraint.
  After introducing the operational capacities outlined above, we show that a
lower bound on the environment-assisted classical capacity is always half the
logarithm of the input space dimension. Then we develop a few techniques to
prove the existence of channels which meet this lower bound up to terms of much
smaller order, even when PPT decoding measurements are allowed (assuming a
certain superadditivity conjecture).

quantum communication sources. We show that, by careful design, one can attain
well defined modes close to the fundamental mode of optical fibers and obtain
high coupling efficiencies also for bulk crystals, these being more easily
aligned than crystal waveguides. We distinguish between singles coupling,
conditional coincidence, and pair coupling, and show how each of these
parameters can be maximized by varying the focusing of the pump mode and the
fiber-matched modes using standard optical elements. Specifically we analyze a
periodically poled KTP-crystal pumped by a 532 nm laser creating photon pairs
at 810 nm and 1550 nm. Numerical calculations lead to coupling efficiencies
above 94% at optimal focusing, which is found by the geometrical relation L/z_R
to be ~ 1 to 2 for the pump mode and ~ 2 to 3 for the fiber-modes, where L is
the crystal length and z_R is the Rayleigh-range of the mode-profile. These
results are independent on L. By showing that the single-mode bandwidth
decreases as 1/L, we can therefore design the source to produce and couple
narrow bandwidth photon pairs well into the fibers. Smaller bandwidth means
both less chromatic dispersion for long propagation distances in fibers, and
that telecom Bragg gratings can be utilized to compensate for broadened photon
packets--a vital problem for time-multiplexed qubits. Longer crystals also
yield an increase in fiber photon flux proportional to sqrt{L}, and so,
assuming correct focusing, we can only see advantages using long crystals.

Bell parameter in the CHSH inequality is decreased, and is no longer given by
the Cirel'son bound.

  encoded in the same basis","8 pages, submitted to PRA","Phys. Rev. A 73, 032304 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.032304",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider the cloning of sequences of qubits prepared in the states used in
the BB84 or 6-state quantum cryptography protocol, and show that the
single-qubit fidelity is unaffected even if entire sequences of qubits are
prepared in the same basis. This result is of great importance for practical
quantum cryptosystems because it reduces the need for high-speed random number
generation without impairing on the security against finite-size attacks.
