dwarfs are thought to evolve through, their abundances were not found to vary
significantly, apart from for the silicon abundances. Abundances measured when
the FUSE derived values of temperature, gravity and helium abundance were

of the nitrogen and iron lines, while for oxygen, the optical parameters were
better.

Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars as a function of metal abundance, over a range between
10^{-5} < (Z/Zsun) < 10. We find that the winds of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet
stars are dominated by iron lines, with a dependence of mass loss on Z similar
to that of massive OB stars. For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind
strength is also found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend
on the chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss
metallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding that
WR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important consequences for black
hole formation and X-ray population studies in external galaxies. A further
finding of our study is that the Z dependence of C-rich WR stars becomes weaker
at metallicities below Z/Zsun < 1/10, and mass loss no longer declines once the
metal abundance drops below (Z/Zsun) = 10^{-3}. This is the result of an
increased importance of radiative driving by intermediate mass elements, such
as carbon. In combination with rapid rotation and/or proximity to the Eddington
limit -- likely to be relevant for massive Population III stars -- this effect
may indicate a role for mass loss in the appearance and evolution of these
objects, as well as a potential role for stellar winds in enriching the
intergalactic medium of the early Universe.

(DLAs with N(HI) > 10^20.3 cm^-2), in particular, are believed to contain a
large fraction of the HI gas but there are also indications that lower column
density systems, named ``sub-Damped Lyman-alpha'' systems play a role at
high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of high-redshift sub-DLAs based on
17 z>4 quasar spectra observed with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph
(UVES) on VLT. This sample is composed of 21 new sub-DLAs which, together with
another 10 systems from previous ESO archive studies, make up a homogeneous
sample. The redshift evolution of the number density of several classes of
absorbers is derived and shows that all systems seem to be evolving in the
redshift range from z=5 to z~3. This is further used to estimate the redshift
evolution of the characteristic radius of these classes of absorbers assuming a
Holmberg relation and one unique underlying parent population. DLAs are found
to have R_* ~ 20 h_100^-1 kpc, while sub-DLAs have R_* ~ 40 h_100^-1 kpc. The
redshift evolution of the column density distribution, f(N,z), down to N(HI) =
10^19 cm^-2 is also presented. A departure from a power law due to a flattening
of f(N,z) in the sub-DLA regime is present in the data. f(N,z) is further used
to determine the HI gas mass contained in sub-DLAs at z>2. The complete sample
shows that sub-DLAs are important at all redshifts from z=5 to z=2. Finally,
the possibility that sub-DLAs are less affected by the effects of dust

NGC 4151 was in a relatively low flux state during the observations reported
here, although roughly 2.5 times as bright in the 2 --10 keV band as during a
Chandra observation in 2000. The soft X-ray band was dominated by emission
lines, which show no discernible variation in flux between the two

absorber, in the form of H-like and He-like Mg, Si, and S lines, as well as
lower ionization gas via the presence of inner-shell absorption lines from
lower-ionization species of these elements. The former is too highly ionized to
be radiatively accelerated in a sub-Eddington source such as NGC 4151. We find
that the lower ionization gas had a column density a factor of ~ 3 higher

calculate the speed of propagation of ionising fronts through different ambient

numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporate black hole growth.
These simulations have motivated a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity
function. In this picture, the bright end of the quasar luminosity function
consists of quasars radiating nearly at their peak luminosities, while the
faint end consists mainly of very similar sources, but at dimmer phases in
their evolution. We combine this model with the statistics of dark matter halos
that host quasar activity. We find that, since bright and faint quasars are
mostly similar sources seen in different evolutionary stages, a broad range in
quasar luminosities corresponds to only a narrow range in the masses of quasar
host halos. On average, bright and faint quasars reside in similar host halos.
Consequently, we argue that quasar clustering should depend only weakly on
luminosity. This prediction is in qualitative agreement with recent
measurements of the luminosity dependence of the quasar correlation function
(Croom et al. 2005) and the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function
(Adelberger & Steidel 2005). Future precision clustering measurements from SDSS
and 2dF, spanning a large range in luminosity, should provide a strong test of
our model.

Type Ia supernovae excellent standard candles for cosmology, so too, the

GRBs as excellent standard candles for cosmology. In addition, GRBs occur over
the broad redshift range from z=0.1 to at least z=4.5, and both they and their

present a revised formula, using the number density ratio K for which we give
estimates. For particle acceleration in strong shocks K is about 40 and
increases with decreasing shock strength. Our revised estimate for the field
strength gives larger values than the classical estimate for flat radio spectra
with spectral indices of about 0.5-0.6, but smaller values for steep spectra
and total fields stronger than about 10 muG. In very young supernova remnants,
for example, the classical estimate may be too large by up to 10x. On the other
hand, if energy losses of cosmic ray electrons are important, K increases with
particle energy and the equipartition field may be underestimated
significantly. Our revised larger equipartition estimates in galaxy clusters
and radio lobes are consistent with independent estimates from Faraday rotation
measures, while estimates from the ratio between radio synchrotron and X-ray
inverse Compton intensities generally give much weaker fields. This may be
explained e.g. by a concentration of the field in filaments. Our revised field
strengths may also lead to major revisions of electron lifetimes in jets and

measure the critical mass ratio for the creation of superhumps. With a
mass-radius relation appropriate for cataclysmic variables, and an assumed mean
white-dwarf mass of 0.75 M_sol, we find a mass ratio q_crit=0.35+-0.02.

presence of particle creation. If there is no particle creation, the proper
mass of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles is necessarily a time dependent
quantity, scaling as $m(t) = m_o a(t)^{\epsilon}$. By considering the presence
of baryons in the cosmological scenario, it is also shown that their dynamic
effect is to alter the transition redshift $z_*$ (the redshift at which the
Universe switches from decelerating to accelerating expansion), predicting
values of $z_*$ compatible with current estimates based on type Ia supernova.
In order to constrain the $\Omega_m - \epsilon$ plane, a joint statistical
analysis involving the current supernovae observations, gas mass fraction
measurements in galaxy clusters and CMB data is performed. At 95% c.l. it is
found that the vacuum decay rate parameter lies on the interval $\epsilon =
0.11 \pm 0.12$). The possibility of a vacuum decay into photons is also
analyzed. In this case, the energy density of the radiation fluid scales as
$\rho_r = \rho_{ro}a^{-4 + \epsilon}$, and its temperature evolution law obeys

proven fact that the superconductivity in RE-123 superconductors is governed by
the oxygen content, which in turn is responsible for the carrier concentration

superconductors undergo structural transformation from orthorhombic to
tetragonal as a function of oxygen content making them very difficult compounds
to work with, in terms of technological applications, such as device

preference for the production of one or other enantiomer, spontaneously
generates a large excess of one of the two enantiomers: (L), left-handed or
(D), right handed. Inorganic processes involving chiral products commonly yield
a racemic mixture of both. However life on Earth uses only one type of amino
acids (L) and one type of natural sugars (D). The origin of this selective
chirality has remained a fundamental enigma in the origin of life since the
time of Pasteur, some 140 years ago. Sodium bromate (NaBrO3) and sodium
chlorate (NaClO3) when crystallize from an unstirred solution generates
statistically equal numbers of left-handed (L) and right handed (D) chiral
crystals. But when these two populations of crystals undergo a
dissolution-crystallization phenomenon, they cannot coexist: one of them
disappears in an irreversible competition process that nurtures the other one.
  From the viewpoint of energy, these two enantiomers can exist with an equal
probability, thus the result of this competition in different systems would be
populations of crystals either (L) or (D). But contradicting this theoretical
prediction the handedness of the chiral crystals that win the competition and
remain in solution in the different systems is almost always the same (99.2
percent for NaBrO3). We suggest that these results are the consequence of
Parity-violating energy difference (PVED) between enantiomers and reinforce the
idea of a key role of PVDE theory in the origin of biomolecular chirality on
Earth.

  Rather, at any time during the simulation, energetics for all possible
(single or multi-atom) processes, within a specific interaction range, are
either computed accurately using a saddle point search procedure, or retrieved
from a database in which previously encountered processes are stored. This
self-learning procedure enhances the speed of the simulations along with a
substantial gain in reliability because of the inclusion of many-particle
processes.
  Accompanying results from the application of the method to the case of
two-dimensional Cu adatom-cluster diffusion and coalescence on Cu(111) with
detailed statistics of involved atomistic processes and contributing diffusion
coefficients attest to the suitability of the method for the purpose.

the system is initially in a superfluid state, far from the regime in which the

the expanding bosons rapidly approaches the momentum distribution of
noninteracting fermions. Remarkably, no loss in coherence is observed in the
system as reflected by a large occupation of the lowest eigenstate of the
one-particle density matrix. In the opposite limit, when the initial system is
a pure Mott insulator with one particle per lattice site, the expansion leads
to the emergence of quasicondensates at finite momentum. In this case,
one-particle correlations like the ones shown to be universal in the
equilibrium case develop in the system. We show that the out-of-equilibrium
behavior of the Shannon information entropy in momentum space, and its contrast
with the one of noninteracting fermions, allows to differentiate the two
different regimes of interest. It also helps in understanding the crossover

behavior of friction as a function of the applied normal load and the sliding

identify three distinct friction regimes with corresponding contact properties:
(a) friction dominated by the additional normal forces induced by capillarity
due to the presence of thick water films, (b) higher drag force from ordering
effects present in thin water layers and (c) low friction due to direct
solid-solid contact for the sample with the counterbody. Depending on
environmental conditions and the applied normal load, all three mechanisms may
be present at one time. Their individual contributions can be identified by
investigating the dependence of friction on the applied normal load as well as
on the sliding velocity in different pressure regimes, thus providing
information about nanoscale friction mechanisms.

behavior of the Asakura-Oosawa-Vrij model we find the polymer-rich phase to wet
a hard wall. The wetting transition is of the first order and is accompanied by
the prewetting transition. We do not find any hints for the layering
transitions in the partial wetting regime. Our results resemble the wetting
behavior in athermal polymer solutions. We point out that an accurate,
monomer-resolved theory for colloid-polymer mixtures should incorporate the
correct scaling behavior in the dilute polymer regime and an accurate
description of the reference system.

due to the presence of charged K exchange for the reaction on a neutron target.
Furthermore, the photon asymmetry is found to display a pronounced sensitivity
to the parity of the Theta^+, making it a very promising observable to help
determining the quantum numbers of the Theta^+ resonance.

we perform accurate mass measurements of low-lying 5Q states with $J=1/2$ and
I=0 in both positive- and negative-parity channels in anisotropic lattice QCD.
The lowest positive-parity 5Q state is found to have a large mass of about
2.24GeV after the chiral extrapolation. To single out the compact 5Q state from
$NK$ scattering states, we develop a new method with the hybrid-boundary
condition (HBC), and find no evidence of the compact 5Q state below 1.75GeV in
the negative-parity channel. Second, we perform the first study of the
multi-quark potential in lattice QCD to clarify the inter-quark interaction in
multi-quark systems. The 5Q potential $V_{\rm 5Q}$ for the QQ-${\rm
\bar{Q}}$-QQ system is found to be well described by the ``OGE Coulomb plus
multi-Y Ansatz"": the sum of the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) Coulomb term and the
multi-Y-type linear term based on the flux-tube picture. The 4Q potential
$V_{\rm 4Q}$ for the QQ-${\rm \bar{Q}\bar{Q}}$ system is also described by the
OGE Coulomb plus multi-Y Ansatz, when QQ and $\rm \bar Q \bar Q$ are well
separated. The 4Q system is described as a ""two-meson"" state with disconnected
flux tubes, when the nearest quark and antiquark pair is spatially close. We
observe a lattice-QCD evidence for the ``flip-flop'', i.e., the flux-tube
recombination between the connected 4Q state and the ``two-meson'' state. On
the confinement mechanism, the lattice QCD results indicate the flux-tube-type
linear confinement in multi-quark hadrons.

generic type IIA and type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds in the presence of
background fluxes by using a Kaluza-Klein reduction. The Kahler potential, the
gauge kinetic functions and the flux-induced superpotential are determined in
terms of geometrical data of the Calabi-Yau orientifold and the background
fluxes. As a new result, it is shown that the chiral description directly
relates to Hitchin's generalized geometry encoded by special odd and even forms
on a threefold, whereas a dual formulation with several linear multiplets makes
contact to the underlying N = 2 special geometry. In type IIB setups, the
flux-potentials can be expressed in terms of superpotentials, D-terms and,
generically, a massive linear multiplet. The type IIA superpotential depends on
all geometric moduli of the theory. It is reviewed, how type IIA orientifolds
arise as a special limit of M-theory compactified on specific G_2 manifolds by
matching the effective actions. In a similar spirit type IIB orientifolds are
shown to descend from F-theory on a specific class of Calabi-Yau fourfolds. In
addition, mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau orientifolds is briefly discussed and
it is shown that the N = 1 chiral coordinates linearize the appropriate
instanton actions.

This system contains one horizontal space dimension and time and can be
systematically derived from the full Euler equations for irrotational flows
with a free surface using a standard long-wave asymptotic expansion.
  In this context the system was first derived by Su and Gardner. It coincides
with the one-dimensional flat-bottom reduction of the Green-Naghdi system and,
additionally, has recently found a number of fluid dynamics applications other
than the present context of shallow-water gravity waves. We then use the
Whitham modulation theory for a one-phase periodic travelling wave to obtain an
asymptotic analytical description of an undular bore in the Su-Gardner system
for a full range of ""depth"" ratios across the bore. The positions of the
leading and trailing edges of the undular bore and the amplitude of the leading
solitary wave of the bore are found as functions of this ""depth ratio"". The
formation of a partial undular bore with a rapidly-varying finite-amplitude
trailing wave front is predicted for ``depth ratios'' across the bore exceeding
1.43. The analytical results from the modulation theory are shown to be in
excellent agreement with full numerical solutions for the development of an

context of the Kerner's there-phase traffic theory, are introduced. In an
acceleration time delay model (ATD-model), different time delays in driver
acceleration associated with driver behaviour in various local driving
situations are explicitly incorporated into the model. Vehicle acceleration
depends on local traffic situation, i.e., whether a driver is within the free
flow, or synchronized flow, or else wide moving jam traffic phase. In a speed
adaptation model (SA-model), vehicle speed adaptation occurs in synchronized
flow depending on driving conditions. It is found that the ATD- and SA-models
show spatiotemporal congested traffic patterns that are adequate with empirical
results. In the ATD- and SA-models, the onset of congestion in free flow at a
freeway bottleneck is associated with a first-order phase transition from free
flow to synchronized flow; moving jams emerge spontaneously in synchronized
flow only. Differences between the ATD- and SA-models are studied. A comparison
of the ATD- and SA-models with stochastic models in the context of three phase
traffic theory is made. A critical discussion of earlier traffic flow theories

Computer Condition* (QCC), a rigorous mathematical statement that connects the
irreversible dynamics of the quantum computing machine, with the reversible
operations that comprise the quantum computation intended to be carried out by
the quantum computing machine. Armed with the QCC, we derive a powerful result
that we call the *Encoding No-Go Theorem*. This theorem gives a precise
mathematical statement of the conditions under which fault-tolerant quantum
computation becomes impossible in the presence of dissipation and/or
decoherence. In connection with this theorem, we explicitly calculate a
universal critical damping value for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In
addition we show that the recently-discovered approach to quantum error
correction known as ""operator quantum error-correction"" (OQEC) is a special
case of our more general formulation. Our approach furnishes what we will refer
to as ""operator quantum fault-tolerance"" (OQFT). In particular, we show how the
QCC allows one to derive error thresholds for fault tolerance in a completely
general context. We prove the existence of solutions to a class of
time-dependent generalizations of the Lindblad equation. Using the QCC, we also

"quant-ph/0507145","Th. M. Nieuwenhuizen","A.E. Allahverdyan and Th.M. Nieuwenhuizen","Explanation of the Gibbs paradox within the framework of quantum
  thermodynamics","Published version. New title. 17 pages Revtex","Phys. Rev. E 73, 066119 (2006) [15 pages]","10.1103/PhysRevE.73.066119",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The issue of the Gibbs paradox is that when considering mixing of two gases
within classical thermodynamics, the entropy of mixing appears to be a
discontinuous function of the difference between the gases: it is finite for
whatever small difference, but vanishes for identical gases. The resolution
offered in the literature, with help of quantum mixing entropy, was later shown
to be unsatisfactory precisely where it sought to resolve the paradox.
Macroscopic thermodynamics, classical or quantum, is unsuitable for explaining
the paradox, since it does not deal explicitly with the difference between the
gases. The proper approach employs quantum thermodynamics, which deals with
finite quantum systems coupled to a large bath and a macroscopic work source.
Within quantum thermodynamics, entropy generally looses its dominant place and
the target of the paradox is naturally shifted to the decrease of the maximally
available work before and after mixing (mixing ergotropy). In contrast to
entropy this is an unambiguous quantity. For almost identical gases the mixing
ergotropy continuously goes to zero, thus resolving the paradox. In this
approach the concept of ``difference between the gases'' gets a clear
operational meaning related to the possibilities of controlling the involved
quantum states. Difficulties which prevent resolutions of the paradox in its
entropic formulation do not arise here. The mixing ergotropy has several
counter-intuitive features. It can increase when less precise operations are
allowed. In the quantum situation (in contrast to the classical one) the mixing
ergotropy can also increase when decreasing the degree of mixing between the
gases, or when decreasing their distinguishability. These points go against a
direct association of physical irreversibility with lack of information.

number of senders and either one or two receivers, sharing a multiparty quantum
state, and using a noiseless channel. For the case of a single receiver, the
capacity of such information transfer is found exactly. It is shown that the
capacity is not enhanced by allowing the senders to perform joint operations.
We provide a nontrivial upper bound on the capacity in the case of two
receivers. We also give a classification of the set of all multiparty states in
terms of their usefulness for dense coding. We provide examples for each of
these classes, and discuss some of their properties.
