distinct free-streaming behaviours can lead to pronounced differences in the
matter power spectrum. While not detectable with current cosmological data,
such differences will be clearly observable with upcoming large scale weak
lensing surveys for particles as light as m_HDM ~ 0.2 eV. In the nonlinear
regime, bosonic hot dark matter is not subject to the same phase space
constraints that severely limit the amount of fermionic hot dark matter infall
into cold dark matter halos. Consequently, the overdensities in fermionic and
bosonic hot dark matter of equal particle mass can differ by more than a factor
of five in the central part of a halo. However, this unique manifestation of
quantum statistics may prove very difficult to detect unless the mass of the
hot dark matter particle and its decoupling temperature fall within a very
narrow window, 1 < m_HDM/eV < 4 and g* < 30. In this case, hot dark matter
infall may have some observable consequences for the nonlinear power spectrum

are pulsars and SN remnants. The microquasar LS 5039, previously proposed to be
associated with an EGRET source by Paredes et al. (2000), has recently been
detected at TeV energies, confirming that microquasars should be regarded as a
class of high energy gamma-ray sources. To model and understand how the
energetic photons are produced and escape from LS 5039 it is crucial to unveil
the nature of the compact object, which remains unknown. Here we present new
intermediate-dispersion spectroscopy of this source which, combined with values
reported in the literature, provides an orbital period of 3.90603+/-0.00017 d,
a mass function f(M)=0.0053+/-0.0009 M_sun, and an eccentricity e=0.35+/-0.04.
Atmosphere model fitting to the spectrum of the optical companion, together
with our new distance estimate of d=2.5+/-0.1 kpc, yields R_opt=9.3+0.7-0.6
R_sun, log (L_opt/L_sun)=5.26+/-0.06, and M_opt=22.9+3.4-2.9 M_sun. These,
combined with our dynamical solution and the assumption of
pseudo-synchronization, yield an inclination i=24.9+/-2.8 degree and a compact
object mass M_X=3.7+1.3-1.0 M_sun. This is above neutron star masses for most
of the standard equations of state and, therefore, we propose that the compact
object in LS 5039 is a black hole. We finally discuss about the implications of
our orbital solution and new parameters of the binary system on the CNO
products, the accretion/ejection energetic balance, the SN explosion scenario,
and the behaviour of the TeV emission with the new orbital period.

scenarios in which metal-poor GCs are formed over a finite period in the early
Universe during the initial stages of galaxy assembly. In this picture, the
observed trend is related to biasing, in the sense that the more massive
galaxies of today began assembling earlier and therefore formed relatively more
GCs during this early epoch of metal-poor GC formation. We discuss how

hexagonal americium monolayers have been studied with the full-potential
linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method. The effects of several common
approximations are examined: (1) non-spin polarization (NSP) vs. spin
polarization (SP); (2) scalar-relativity (no spin-orbit coupling (NSO)) vs.
full-relativity (i.e., with spin-orbit (SO) coupling included); (3)
local-density approximation (LDA) vs. generalized-gradient approximation (GGA).
Our results indicate that both spin polarization and spin orbit coupling play
important roles in determining the geometrical and electronic properties of
americium bulk and monolayers. A compression of both americium square and
hexagonal monolayers compared to the americium bulk is also observed. In
general, the LDA is found to underestimate the equilibrium lattice constant and
give a larger total energy compared to the GGA calculations. While spin orbit
coupling shows a similar effect on both square and hexagonal monolayer
calculations regardless of the model, GGA versus LDA, an unusual spin
polarization effect on both square and hexagonal monolayers is found in the LDA
results as compared with the GGA results. The 5f delocalization transition of
americium is employed to explain our observed unusual spin polarization effect.
In addition, our results at the LDA level of theory indicate a possible 5f
delocalization could happen in the americium surface within the same Am II (fcc
crystal structure) phase, unlike the usually reported americium 5f
delocalization which is associated with crystal structure change. The
similarities and dissimilarities between the properties of an Am monolayer and
a Pu monolayer are discussed in detail.

theoretical voltage modulation for symmetric junctions is shown to be in a good
agreement with the results of known computer simulations. It is shown that the
asymmetry of the junctions results in the increase of the voltage modulation if
the critical current is in excess of some threshold value (about 8 microAmps).
Below this value the asymmetry leads to the reduction of the voltage modulation
as compared to the symmetric case. The comparison with the experiment shows
that the asymmetry can explain a large portion of experimental values of the
voltage modulation which lie above the theoretical curve for symmetric DC
SQUID. It also explains experimental points which lie below the curve at small
critical currents. However, a significant portion of these values which lie
below the curve cannot be explained by the junction asymmetry.

of the moments of spectral functions. Such moments can be computed by formal
differentiation of certain estimating functionals that are
infinitely-differentiable against time whenever the potential function is
arbitrarily smooth. Here, I demonstrate that the numerical differentiation of
the estimating functionals can be more successfully implemented by means of
pseudospectral methods (e.g., exact differentiation of a Chebyshev polynomial
interpolant), which utilize information from the entire interval $(-\beta \hbar
/ 2, \beta \hbar/2)$. The algorithmic detail that leads to robust numerical
approximations is the fact that the path integral action and not the actual
estimating functional are interpolated. Although the resulting approximation to
the estimating functional is non-linear, the derivatives can be computed from
it in a fast and stable way by contour integration in the complex plane, with
the help of the Cauchy integral formula (e.g., by Lyness' method). An
interesting aspect of the present development is that Hamburger's conditions
for a finite sequence of numbers to be a moment sequence provide the necessary
and sufficient criteria for the computed data to be compatible with the
existence of an inversion algorithm. Finally, the issue of appearance of the

is actively forced through the material, rather than allowed to diffuse. Unlike
in passive microrheology, active forcing allows the material to be driven out

renders inoperable the fluctuation-dissipation theorem used to justify passive
microrheology. Here we explore a question at the heart of active microrheology:
are its results consistent with macrorheology? We study a simple model material
-- a generalized Newtonian fluid, with a small but arbitrary
shear-rate-dependent component -- and derive a general expression for
dissipation due to probe motion, which remarkably does not require the
non-Newtonian flow to be solved. We demonstrate that the straightforward
application of active microrheology gives results that are inconsistent with
macrorheology, even when the probe is large enough for material to behave as a
continuum, unless the forcing is gentle enough to probe only the linear
response. Regardless, each technique encodes information about the material; if
suitably interpreted, the (macro-) constitutive relation can indeed be
recovered from the microrheological data. We emphasize that more, rather than

relativity gives rise to the emergence of a minimum uncertainty both in space
and time. The arguments that support this conclusion are mainly based on
perturbative approaches to the quantization, in which the gravitational
interactions of the matter content are described as corrections to a classical
background. In a recent paper, we analyzed the existence of a minimum time
uncertainty in the framework of doubly special relativity. In this framework,
the standard definition of the energy-momentum of particles is modified
appealing to possible quantum gravitational effects, which are not necessarily
perturbative. Demanding that this modification be completed into a canonical
transformation determines the implementation of doubly special relativity in
position space and leads to spacetime coordinates that depend on the
energy-momentum of the particle. In the present work, we extend our analysis to
the quantum length uncertainty. We show that, in generic cases, there actually
exists a limit in the spatial resolution, both when the quantum evolution is
described in terms of the auxiliary time corresponding to the Minkowski
background or in terms of the physical time. These two kinds of evolutions can
be understood as corresponding to perturbative and non-perturbative
descriptions, respectively. This result contrasts with that found for the time
uncertainty, which can be made to vanish in all models with unbounded physical
energy if one adheres to a non-perturbative quantization.

a pure SU(3) lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Using a series for the

show that the analysis of the extrapolated ratio and the extrapolated slope
suggests the possibility of a non-analytical power behavior of the form
(1/\beta -1/5.7(1))^{1.0(1)}, in agreement with another analysis based on the
same asumption. This would imply that the third derivative of the free energy
density diverges near beta =5.7. We show that the peak in the third derivative
of the free energy present on 4^4 lattices disappears if the size of the
lattice is increased isotropically up to a 10^4 lattice. On the other hand, on
4 x L^3 lattices, a jump in the third derivative persists when L increases. Its
location coincides with the onset of a non-zero average for the Polyakov loop.
We show that the apparent contradiction at zero temperature can be resolved by
moving the singularity in the complex 1/\beta plane. If the imaginary part of
the location of the singularity Gamma is within the range 0.001< Gamma < 0.01,
it is possible to limit the second derivative of P within an acceptable range
without affecting drastically the behavior of the perturbative coefficients. We
discuss the possibility of checking the existence of these complex
singularities by using the strong coupling expansion or calculating the zeroes
of the partition function.

the clustering property of the scalar correlation functions. This argument also
holds for other theories with a mass gap and broken chiral symmetry such as QCD
with one flavor. For QCD with several flavors a modified clustering property is
derived from the low energy chiral Lagrangian. We also obtain sum rules for a
fixed external gauge field and show their relation with the bosonized version
of the Schwinger model. In the sector of topological charge $\nu$ the sum rules
are consistent with a shift of the Dirac spectrum away from zero by $\nu/2$
average level spacings. This shift is also required to obtain a nonzero chiral
condensate in the massless limit. Finally, we discuss the Dirac spectrum for a
closely related two-dimensional theory for which the gauge field action is

and the theories whose scalar manifolds are homogeneous but not symmetric do
not lead to unified MESGTs in four dimensions. The three infinite families of

whose scalar manifolds are non-homogeneous, do not lead directly to unified
MESGTs in four dimensions under dimensional reduction. However, since their
