mass X-ray binary GX 5-1. Thanks to the excellent angular resolution and
sensitivity of INTEGRAL, we are able to obtain a high quality spectrum of GX
5-1 from ~5 keV to ~100 keV, for the first time without contamination from the
nearby black hole candidate GRS 1758-258 above 20 keV. During our observations,
GX 5-1 is mostly found in the horizontal and normal branch of its hardness
intensity diagram. A clear hard X-ray emission is observed above ~30 keV which
exceeds the exponential cut-off spectrum expected from lower energies. This
spectral flattening may have the same origin of the hard components observed in
other Z sources as it shares the property of being characteristic to the
horizontal branch. The hard excess is explained by introducing Compton
up-scattering of soft photons from the neutron star surface due to a thin hot
plasma expected in the boundary layer. The spectral changes of GX 5-1 downward
along the ""Z"" pattern in the hardness intensity diagram can be well described
in terms of monotonical decrease of the neutron star surface temperature. This
may be a consequence of the gradual expansion of the boundary layer as the mass
accretion rate increases.

substructures for the mass loss they suffer whilst orbiting within a sample of
high resolution galaxy cluster mass Cold Dark Matter haloes formed in
cosmological N-body simulations. We have defined a quantitative measure that
gauges the degree to which interactions are responsible for mass loss from
substructures. This measure indicates that interactions are more prominent in
younger systems when compared to older more relaxed systems. We show that this
is due to the increased number of encounters a satellite experiences and a
higher mass fraction in satellites. This is in spite of the uniformity in the
distributions of relative distances and velocities of encounters between
substructures within the different host systems in our sample. Using a simple
model to relate the net force felt by a single satellite to the mass loss it
suffers, we show that interactions with other satellites account for ~30% of
the total mass loss experienced over its lifetime. The relation between the age
of the host and the importance of interactions increases the scatter about this
mean value from ~25% for the oldest to ~45% for the youngest system we have
studied. We conclude that satellite interactions play a vital role in the
evolution of substructure in dark matter halos and that a significant fraction
of the tidally stripped material can be attributed to these interactions.

is usual flickering and Quasi-Periodic Oscillations. However, we detected
variability with a period of ~101 and/or ~105 sec, seen for a short time every

formalism of sub-barrier scattering operators. The method which calculates the
total scattering amplitude of the bridge molecule not only predicts the
enhancement of the amplitude of tunneling transitions in course of tunneling
electron transfer through one-dimensional molecular structures but also allows
us to interpret conductance mechanisms by calculating the bound energy spectrum
of the tunneling electron, the energies being obtained as poles of the total
scattering amplitude of the bridge molecule. We found that the resonant
tunneling via bound states of the tunneling electron is the major mechanism of
electron conductivity in relatively long organic molecules. The sub-barrier
scattering technique naturally includes a description of tunneling in applied
electric fields which allows us to calculate I-V curves at finite bias. The
developed theory is applied to explain experimental findings such as bridge
effect due to tunneling through organic molecules, and threshold versus Ohmic

The spatial distribution of the radiation power and the dependence of the
emitted photon energy on the direction of radiation are also studied in detail
for the first time. We analyze the $SL\nu$ polarization properties and show
that within a wide range of neutrino momenta and matter densities the $SL\nu$
radiation is circularly polarized. Conditions for effective $SL\nu$ photon
propagation in the electron plasma are discussed. It is also shown that in
dense matter the average energy of the emitted photon can reach values in the
range from one third of the neutrino momentum up to one half of the neutrino
energy in matter. The main features of the studied radiation are summarized,
and possibilities for the $SL\nu$ production during different astrophysical and

phenomena. It is also intended to pique the interest of the layman as well as
the professional. All aerodynamic forces on a surface are caused by collisions
of fluid particles with the surface. While the standard approach to fluid
dynamics, which is founded on the fluid approximation, is effective in
providing a means of calculating various behavior and properties, it begs the
question of causality. The determination of the causes of many of the most
important aerodynamic effects requires a microscopic examination of the fluid
and of the surface with which it interacts. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is
investigated from first physical principles. It is noted that the circulation
does not arise alone as a physical phenomenon, e.g. air doesn't flow forward
under a wing, but must be added to the translation flow. The circulation term
is necessary to take into account the vertical deflection of the air flow by a
wing. Various aerodynamic devices are discussed, e.g. rocket engine exhaust
diffuser and the perfume atomizer. The section on slurries discusses
pyroclastic flow as occurs in violent volcanic eruptions.

  and updated the references","Canadian Journal of Physics 84: 633-638, 2006.","10.1139/P06-036",,"quant-ph",,"  The strongest attack against quantum mechanics came in 1935 in the form of a
paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. It was argued that the theory of quantum
mechanics could not be called a complete theory of Nature, for every element of
reality is not represented in the formalism as such. The authors then put forth
a proposition: we must search for a theory where, upon knowing everything about
the system, including possible hidden variables, one could make precise
predictions concerning elements of reality. This project was ultimatly doomed
in 1964 with the work of Bell Bell, who showed that the most general local
hidden variable theory could not reproduce correlations that arise in quantum
mechanics. There exist mainly three forms of no-go theorems for local hidden
variable theories. Although almost every physicist knows the consequences of
these no-go theorems, not every physicist is aware of the distinctions between
the three or even their exact definitions. Thus we will discuss here the three
principal forms of no-go theorems for local hidden variable theories of Nature.
We will define Bell inequalities, Bell inequalities without inequalities and
pseudo-telepathy. A discussion of the similarities and differences will follow.

  Jonathan P. Dowling","Quantum Interferometric Sensors","Submitted to Concepts of Physics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum entanglement has the potential to revolutionize the entire field of
interferometric sensing by providing many orders of magnitude improvement in
interferometer sensitivity. The quantum-entangled particle interferometer
approach is very general and applies to many types of interferometers. In
particular, without nonlocal entanglement, a generic classical interferometer
has a statistical-sampling shot-noise limited sensitivity that scales like
$1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles passing through the
interferometer per unit time. However, if carefully prepared quantum
correlations are engineered between the particles, then the interferometer
sensitivity improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ to scale like 1/N, which is the
limit imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. For optical
interferometers operating at milliwatts of optical power, this quantum
sensitivity boost corresponds to an eight-order-of-magnitude improvement of
signal to noise. This effect can translate into a tremendous science pay-off
for space missions. For example, one application of this new effect is to fiber
optical gyroscopes for deep-space inertial guidance and tests of General
Relativity (Gravity Probe B). Another application is to ground and orbiting
optical interferometers for gravity wave detection, Laser Interferometer
Gravity Observatory (LIGO) and the European Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA), respectively. Other applications are to Satellite-to-Satellite laser
Interferometry (SSI) proposed for the next generation Gravity Recovery And
Climate Experiment (GRACE II).

but of some rather pathological representations of CCR/CAR algebras. In some
other Fock space representations the notion simply does not exist. We have
checked all the main Gedanken experiments where the notion of entanglement with
vacuum was used, and found that all the calculations could be performed at a
representation-independent level. In particular any such experiment can be
formulated in a Fock-space representation where the notion of entanglement with
vacuum is meaningless. So, for the moment there is no single experiment where
the notion is needed, and probably it is simply unphysical.

a released cloud, are calculated for hard-core bosonic (HCB) atoms. We find
that the standard mapping of HCB systems onto spin-1/2 XY models fails in
application to computation of noise correlations. This is due to the
contribution of multiply occupied virtual states to noise correlations in
bosonic systems. Such states do not exist in spin models. We use these
correlations to explore quantum coherence of the ground states and re-address
the relationship between the peaks present in noise correlation and the Mott
phase. Our analysis points to distinctive new experimental signatures of the
Mott phase. The importance of these correlations is illustrated in an example
of a quasiperiodic potential that exhibits a localization transition. In this
case, in contrast to the momentum distribution, the noise correlations reveal
the presence of quasiperiodic order in the localized phase.

means of a collection of generalized measurement operators. In particular,
given a complete set of orthogonal projectors, it is possible to implement a
reversible quantum measurement that preserves the probabilities. In this
context, we introduce the concept of ""Truth-Observable"", which is the physical
counterpart of an inner logical truth.
