the AU scale of the pre-main-sequence star FU Orionis with the PTI, IOTA and
VLTI interferometers. This young stellar object has been observed on 42 nights
over a period of 6 years from 1998 to 2003. We have obtained 287 independent
measurements of the fringe visibility with 6 different baselines ranging from
20 to 110 meters in length, in the H and K bands. Our extensive (u,v)-plane
coverage, coupled with the published spectral energy distribution data, allows
us to test the accretion disk scenario. We find that the most probable
explanation for these observations is that FU Ori hosts an active accretion
disk whose temperature law is consistent with standard models. We are able to
constrain the geometry of the disk, including an inclination of 55 deg and a
position angle of 47 deg. In addition, a 10 percent peak-to-peak oscillation is
detected in the data (at the two-sigma level) from the longest baselines, which
we interpret as a possible disk hot-spot or companion. However, the oscillation
in our best data set is best explained with an unresolved spot located at a
projected distance of 10 AU at the 130 deg position angle and with a magnitude
difference of DeltaK = 3.9 and DeltaH = 3.6 mag moving away from the center at
a rate of 1.2 AU/yr. we propose to interpret this spot as the signature of a
companion of the central FU Ori system on an extremely eccentric orbit. We
speculate that the close encounter of this putative companion and the central
star could be the explanation of the initial photometric rise of the luminosity
of this object.

Our distance result for NGC 300 from this combined optical/near infrared

due to reddening, metallicity effects and crowding are less important. Our
distance determination is consistent with the earlier result from near-infrared

accurate. Our distance value also agrees with the HST Key Project result of

galaxies remains controversial. That debate often centers on the nature (bound
vs. unbound) of extended populations of stars. However, the more fundamental
issue of the very existence of the extended populations is still contentious.
We present an evaluation of the debate centering on one particular dSph,
Carina, for which claims both for and against the existence of stars beyond the
King radius have been made. Our review includes an examination of all previous
studies bearing on the Carina radial profile and shows that the survey method
which achieves the highest detected dSph signal-to-background in the outer
parts of the galaxy is the Washington M, T2 + DDO51 (MTD) filter approach from
Paper II in this series. We then address statistical methods used to evaluate
the reliability of MTD surveys in the presence of photometric errors and for
which a new, a posteriori statistical analysis methodology is provided.
Finally, these statistical methods are tested by new spectroscopy of stars in
the MTD-selected Carina candidate sample. Of 74 candidate giants with follow-up
spectroscopy, the MTD technique identified 61 new Carina members, including 8
stars outside the King radius. From a sample of 29 stars not initially
identified as candidate Carina giants but that lie just outside of our
selection criteria, 12 have radial velocities consistent with membership,
including 5 extratidal stars. Carina is shown to have an extended population of
giant stars extending to a major axis radius of 40' (1.44x the nominal King

association of gamma-ray bursts with core-collapse supernova explosions from

burst relativistic jet has to propagate through the cold dense stellar material
before it reaches the transparency radius and the burst photons are produced.
This propagation is likely to affect the initial properties of the jet, shaping
it and changing its energy composition. The variability injected at the base of
the jet is also likely to be erased by the jet-star interaction. Despite this,
GRBs seem to have remarkably predictable properties once the radiative phase
sets in, as emphasized by the recent discovery of several tight correlation
between spectral, geometric and energetic properties of the jet. In this
contribution we discuss the jet interaction with the star, emphasizing its
time-dependent properties and the resulting energy distribution. We finally
emphasize the surprising predictability of jet and radiation properties outside

in the Bw band. Spectroscopy and further imaging of this target reveals that
the optical source is an almost purely line-emitting nebula with little, if
any, detectable diffuse continuum emission. The Lya nebula has a luminosity of
L[Lya] ~ 1.7e44 erg/s and an extent of at least 20 arcsec (160 kpc). Its
central ~8 arcsec shows an ordered, monotonic velocity profile; interpreted as
rotation, this region encloses a mass M = 6e12 Msun. Several sources lie within

controlled by a fundamental property of circumstellar disks, namely their very
large vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain evaporation
temperature on gas density. As a result, the bright side of the rim is
""curved"", rather than ""vertical"", as expected when a constant evaporation
temperature is assumed. We have computed a number of rim models, which take
into account this effect in a self-consistent way. The results show that the
curved rim (as the vertical rim) emits most of its radiation in the near and
mid-IR, and provides a simple explanation to the observed values of the near-IR
excess (the ""3 micron bump"" of Herbig Ae stars). Contrary to the vertical rim,
for curved rims the near-IR excess does not depend much on the inclination,
being maximum for face-on objects. We have then computed synthetic images of
the curved rim seen under different inclinations; face-on rims are seen as
bright, centrally symmetric rings on the sky; increasing the inclination, the
rim takes an elliptical shape, with one side brighter than the other.

relations in the V, I, W,

relations derived from the same technique, and are significantly steeper than
the LMC PL relations in these bands observed by the OGLE-II Project in V, I and

distance moduli of the LMC Cepheids show a significant dependence on period,
which hints at a systematic error in the ISB technique related to the period of
the stars. We identify as the most likely culprit the p-factor which converts
the radial into pulsational velocities; our data imply a much steeper period
dependence of the p-factor than previously thought, and we derive p=1.58
(+/-0.02) -0.15 (+/-0.05) logP as the best fit from our data, with a zero point
tied to the Milky Way open cluster Cepheids. Using this revised p-factor law,
the period dependence of the LMC Cepheid distance moduli disappears, and at the
same time the Milky Way and LMC PL relations agree among themselves, and with
the directly observed LMC PL relations, within the 1 sigma uncertainties. Our
main conclusion is that the previous, steeper Galactic PL relations were caused
by an erroneous calibration of the p-factor law, and that there is now evidence
that the slope of the Cepheid PL relation is independent of metallicity up to
solar metallicity, in both optical, and near-infrared bands.

galaxies with nebular emission (known as e[a] galaxies) are mostly

is well matched by a model in which >5 per cent of the stellar mass has been

consistent with models that form galaxies in a single-burst of star-formation
at z > 2.0, and evolve passively thereafter. Secondly, the faint-end slope of
the LF appears to become shallower at higher redshift. We conclude that the

early times when the WD flux is high, and late times when the flux is near the
quiescent level. The break between these two regimes, occurring at a time of
order the outburst duration, corresponds to a thermal diffusion wave reaching
the base of the freshly accreted layer. Our principal result is that long after
the outburst, the fractional flux perturbation about the quiescent flux decays
as a power law with time (and {\it not} as an exponential). We use this result
to construct a simple fitting formula that yields estimates for both the
quiescent flux and the accreted column, i.e. the total accreted mass divided by
WD surface area. The WD mass is not well constrained by the late time
lightcurve alone, but it can be inferred if the accreted mass is known from
observations. We compare our work with the well-studied outburst of WZ Sge,
finding that the cooling is well described by our model, giving an effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}=14,500 {\rm K}$ and accreted column $\Delta
y\approx10^6 {\rm g cm^{-2}}$, in agreement with the modeling of Godon et al.
To reconcile this accreted column with the accreted mass inferred from the
bolometric accretion luminosity, a large WD mass $\gtrsim1.1M_\odot$ is needed.
Our power law result is a valuable tool for making quick estimates of the
outburst properties. We show that fitting the late time lightcurve with this
formula yields a predicted column within 20% of that estimated from our full

profile of the current helicity averaged over time and latitude can be
extracted from the available observations. The main feature of this
distribution can be presented as follows. Both shallow and deep active regions
demonstrate a clear dominance of one sign of current helicity in a given
hemisphere during the whole cycle. Broadly speaking, current helicity has
opposite polarities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, although there
are some active regions that violate this polarity rule. The relative number of
active regions violating the polarity rule is significantly higher for deeper
active regions. A separation of active regions into `shallow', `middle' and
`deep' is made by comparing their rotation rate and the helioseismic rotation
law. We use a version of Parker's dynamo model in two spatial dimensions, that
employs a nonlinearity based on magnetic helicity conservation arguments. The
predictions of this model about the radial distribution of solar current
helicity appear to be in remarkable agreement with the available observational
data; in particular the relative volume occupied by the current helicity of
""wrong"" sign grows significantly with the depth.

the inner disk rotation is dominated by gravity but magnetism is not negligible
at radii where the rotation curve becomes flat, and indeed becomes dominant at
very large radii. Values of the order of 1 $\mu$G, or even less, produce a
centripetal force when the absolute value of the slope of the curve [$B_\phi$,
R] (azimuthal field strength versus radius) is less than $R^{-1}$. The
$R^{-1}$-profile is called the critical profile. From this hypothesis, the
following is to be expected: at large radii, a ``subcritical'' profile (slope
flatter than $R^{-1}$); at still larger radii a $B_\phi$-profile becoming
asymptotically critical as the density becomes asymptotically vanishing. Recent
observations of magnetic fields in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way are in very good
agreement with these predictions. This magnetic alternative requires neither
galactic dark matter (DM) nor modification of fundamental laws of physics, but
it is not in conflict with these hypotheses, especially with the existence of

leading behaviour of our network is like the BA model. Defining link weight as
an algebraic power of its Euclidean length, the weight distribution and the

calculated. It is claimed that a power law decay of the link weights with time

transport is reduced significantly below the bulk value by boundary scattering
off interface defects and/or interface modes. The Knudsen flow effects are
important for almost all types of semiconductor nanostructures but we find them
most pronounced in Si and SiC systems due to the very large phonon mean-free
paths. We apply and test our wire thermal-transport results to recent
measurements on Si nanowires. We further investigate and predict size effects
in typical multilayered SiC nanostructures, for example, a
doped-SiC/SiC/SiO$_2$ layered structure that could define the transport channel
in a nanosize transistor. Here the phonon-interface scattering produces a
heterostructure thermal conductivity smaller than what is predicted in a
traditional heat-transport calculation, suggesting a breakdown of the
traditional Fourier analysis even at room temperatures. Finally, we show that
the effective thermal transport in a SiC/SiO$_2$ heterostructure is sensitive
to the oxide depth and could thus be used as an in-situ probe of the SiC
oxidation progress.

identical conditions. All the films are epitaxial and have cubic unit cell. The
amount of strain relaxation has been varied by taking three different single
crystal substrates of SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO. It has been found that for
thicker films the strain gets relaxed and produces variable amount of disorder
depending on the strength of strain relaxation. The magnitude of lattice
relaxation has been found to be 0.384, 3.057 and 6.411 percent for film
deposited on SrTiO_3, LaAlO_3 and MgO respectively. The films on LaAlO_3 and
SrTiO_3 show higher T_{IM} of 243 K and 217 K respectively as compared to
T_{IM} of 191 K for the film on MgO. Similarly T_C of the films on SrTiO_3 and
LaAlO_3 is sharper and has value of 245 K and 220 K respectively whereas the TC
of the film on MgO is 175 K. Higher degree of relaxation creates more defects
and hence TIM (T_C) of the film on MgO is significantly lower than of SrTiO_3
and LaAlO_3. We have adopted a different approach to correlate the effect of
strain relaxation on magneto-transport properties of LCMO films by evaluating
the resistivity variation through Mott's VRH model. The variable presence of
disorder in these thick films due to lattice relaxation which have been
analyzed through Mott's VRH model provides a strong additional evidence that
the strength of lattice relaxation produces disorder dominantly by increase in
density of defects such as stacking faults, dislocations, etc. which affect the
magneto-transport properties of thick epitaxial La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 films.

background classical spacetime manifold, it then follows as a consequence,
(upon making one plausible assumption), that a quantum description of gravity
should be necessarily non-linear. This is true independent of the mathematical
structure used for describing such a formulation of quantum mechanics. A
specific model which exhibits this non-linearity is constructed, using the
language of noncommutative geometry. We derive a non-linear Schrodinger
equation for the quantum dynamics of a particle; this equation reduces to the
standard linear Schrodinger equation when the mass of the particle is much
smaller than Planck mass. It turns out that the non-linear equation found by us
is very similar to a non-linear Schrodinger equation found by Doebner and
Goldin in 1992 from considerations of unitary representaions of the
infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms in three spatial dimensions. Our
analysis suggests that the diffusion constant introduced by Doebner and Goldin
depends on the mass of the particle, and that this constant tends to zero in
the limit in which the particle mass is much smaller than Planck mass, so that
in this limit the non-linear theory reduces to standard linear quantum

constraining the matching, and in which some points may only appear in one of
the configurations. We derive procedures for simultaneous inference about the
matching and the transformation, using a Bayesian approach. Our model is based
on a Poisson process for hidden true point locations; this leads to
considerable mathematical simplification and efficiency of implementation. We
find a novel use for classic distributions from directional statistics in a
conditionally conjugate specification for the case where the geometrical
transformation includes an unknown rotation. Throughout, we focus on the case
of affine or rigid motion transformations. Under a broad parametric family of
loss functions, an optimal Bayesian point estimate of the matching matrix can

Fermi shift and by accounting for the solvation effect due to the environment.
