observed scatter of ~ +/-0.35 mag implying an intrinsic scatter < +/-0.30 mag.
However, when the TFR is calibrated from distances derived from the Hubble
relation for field galaxies scatter is consistently found to be +/-0.64 to
+/-0.84 mag. This significantly larger scatter requires that intrinsic TFR
scatter is actually much larger than +/-0.30 mag, that field galaxies have an
intrinsic TFR scatter much larger than cluster spirals, or that field galaxies
have a velocity dispersion relative to the Hubble flow in excess of 1000 km
s-1. Each of these potential explanations faces difficulties contradicted by
available data and the results of previous studies. An alternative explanation
is that the measured redshifts of galaxies are composed of a cosmological
redshift component predicted from the value of the Hubble Constant and a
superimposed intrinsic redshift component previously identified in other
studies. This intrinsic redshift component may exceed 5000 km s-1 in individual
galaxies. In this alternative scenario a possible value for the Hubble Constant
is 55-60 km s-1 Mpc-1.

description of the correlation between the masses of Super-Massive Black-Holes
(SMBH, M_bh) and the velocity dispersions of their host spheroid (sigma). An
unknown relation between log(M_bh) and log(sigma) may be expanded to second
order to obtain a log-quadratic relation of the form log(M_bh)=alpha+beta
log(sigma/200) + beta_2[log(sigma/200)]^2. We perform a Bayesian analysis using
the Nuker sample, and solve for beta, beta_2 and alpha, in addition to the
intrinsic scatter (delta). We find unbiased parameter estimates of
beta=4.2+/-0.37, beta_2=1.6+/-1.3 and delta=0.275+/-0.05. At the 80% level the
M_bh-sigma relation does not follow a uniform power-law. Indeed, over the
velocity range 70km/s<sigma<380km/s the logarithmic slope of the best fit
relation varies between 2.7 and 5.1, which should be compared with a power-law
estimate of 4.02+/-0.33. Assuming no systematic offset, single epoch virial
SMBH masses estimated for AGN follow the same log-quadratic M_bh-sigma relation
as the Nuker sample, but extend it downward in mass by an order of magnitude.
The log-quadratic term in the M_bh-sigma relation has a significant effect on
estimates of the local SMBH mass function at M_bh>10^9 solar masses, leading to
densities of SMBHs with M_bh>10^10 solar masses that are several orders of
magnitude larger than inferred from a log-linear relation. We also estimate
unbiased parameters for the SMBH-bulge mass relation. With a parameterisation
log(M_bh)=alpha_b + beta_b log(M_b/10^{11}) + beta_2b[log(M_b/10^{11})]^2, we
find beta_b=1.15+/-0.18 and beta_2b=0.12+/-0.14. We determined an intrinsic
scatter delta_b=0.41+/-0.07 which is ~50% larger than the scatter in the

mode identification method to the oblique distorted pulsations observed in
rapidly oscillating Ap stars. We demonstrate that a non-axisymmetric
superposition of the pulsation and rotation velocity fields results in a
qualitatively new behaviour of some of the line profile characteristics. It is
found that for the majority of roAp stars the second moment varies with the
pulsation frequency rather than with its first harmonic even for axisymmetric
modes. We also identify pulsation observables which do not change during
pulsation cycle but are modulated by the stellar rotation and can contribute to
the variability of the stellar spectra averaged over many pulsation cycles. As
an illustration of the new version of the moment technique, we compute
rotational modulation of the pulsational changes of the line profile moments
for the oblique axisymmetric dipolar pulsation modes with different parameters.
It is also shown that a distortion of the oblique dipolar modes predicted by
the recent theoretical studies of the stellar magneto-acoustic oscillations can
be readily diagnosed through the moment analysis. In particular, the shape of
the pulsation phase modulation for the radial velocity and the second moment is
very sensitive to non-axisymmetric pulsation components, whereas the rotational
modulation of the second moment amplitude is best suited to reveal axisymmetric
magnetically induced distortion of pulsations.

electrode directly into a very localized image charge stabilized states on the
molecule. Due to this mechanism, an exceptionally large number of redox states
may be visited within an energy scale which would normally not allow the
molecular HOMO-LUMO gap to be transversed. With a reasonable set of parameters,
a good fit to recent experimental values may be obtained. The theoretical model
is furthermore used to search for the physical boundaries of this effect, and
it is found that a rather narrow geometrical space is available for the new
mechanism to be effective: In the specific case of oligophenylenevinylene
molecules recently explored in such devices several atoms in the terminal
benzene rings need to be at van der Waal's distance to the electrode in order
for the mechanism to be effective. The model predicts, that chemisorption of

dependence. The lower defect density of these heterostructures, compared to
typical lower temperature grown GaMnAs, enables the observation of both
polarization-resolved PL and coherent electron spin dynamics, from which the
conduction band exchange parameter is extracted. No evidence of long-range Mn

indicate spin heating due to photoexcitation. The electron spin lifetime is

when D>=5. This provides strong evidence that the leading singularity for the
virial series lies away from the positive real axis when D>=5. Further analysis
provides evidence that negative virial coefficients will be seen for some k>10
for D=4, and there is a distinct possibility that negative virial coefficients
will also eventually occur for D=3.

shown that in the weak field Cartan torsion approximation, the torsion vector
is orthogonal to the superfluid plane wave velocity. Torsion vector is also
shown to be aligned along the vortex direction in the superfluid. The
background torsion is shown to induce rotation on the fluid as happens with the

particularly relevant when the variety has non-isolated singularities. We first
show how the radial extension technique of M.-H. Schwartz can be adapted to
1-forms, allowing us to define the Schwartz index of 1-forms with isolated
singularities on singular varieties. Then we see how MacPherson's local Euler
obstruction, adapted to 1-forms in general, relates to the Schwartz index, thus
obtaining a proportionality theorem for these indices analogous to the one for
vector fields. We also extend the definition of the GSV-index to 1-forms with
isolated singularities on (local) complete intersections with non-isolated
singularities that satisfy the Thom $a_f$-condition, thus extending to this
setting the index introduced by Ebeling and Gusein-Zade. When the form is the
differential of a holomorphic function $h$, this index measures the number of
critical points of a generic perturbation of $h$ on a local Milnor fiber. We
prove the corresponding proportionality theorem for this index.

alternative way for studying the various characteristic classes of singular
varities and the relations amongst them.

non-classical within 20 years, but for the effects of environmental
decoherence. The dynamics of quantum and classical probability distributions
are compared for a satellite rotating perpendicular to its orbital plane,
driven by the gravitational gradient. The model is studied with and without
environmental decoherence. Without decoherence, the maximum quantum-classical
(QC) differences in its average angular momentum scale as hbar^{2/3} for
chaotic states, and as hbar^2 for non-chaotic states, leading to negligible QC
differences for a macroscopic object like Hyperion. The quantum probability
distributions do not approach their classical limit smoothly, having an
extremely fine oscillatory structure superimposed on the smooth classical
background. For a macroscopic object, this oscillatory structure is too fine to
be resolved by any realistic measurement. Either a small amount of smoothing
(due to the finite resolution of the apparatus) or a very small amount of
environmental decoherence is sufficient ensure the classical limit. Under
decoherence, the QC differences in the probability distributions scale as
(hbar^2/D)^{1/6}, where D is the momentum diffusion parameter. We conclude that
decoherence is not essential to explain the classical behavior of macroscopic
bodies.
