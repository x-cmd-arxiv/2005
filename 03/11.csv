component in the cosmic ray spectrum, we have fitted the observed data down to
$10^{8.6}$ GeV and have obtained the corresponding power emissivity. This
transition energy is well below the threshold for resonant $p\gamma$ absorption
on the cosmic microwave background, and thus source evolution is an essential
ingredient in the fitting procedure. Two-parameter fits in the spectral and
redshift evolution indices show that a standard Fermi $E_i^{-2}$ source
spectrum is excluded at larger than 95% confidence level (CL). Armed with the
primordial emissivity, we follow Waxman and Bahcall to derive the associated
neutrino flux on the basis of optically thin sources. For $pp$ interactions as
the generating mechanism, the neutrino flux exceeds the AMANDA-B10 90%CL upper
limits. In the case of $p\gamma$ dominance, the flux is marginally consistent
with AMANDA-B10 data. In the new scenario the source neutrino flux dominates
over the cosmogenic flux at all energies. Thus, should data from AMANDA-II
prove consistent with the model, we show that IceCube can measure the
characteristic power law of the neutrino spectrum, and thus provide a window on
the source dynamics.

placed among luminous quasars; therefore our objects belong to the group of
high luminosity analogues of the sources contributing to the X-ray background
seen in deep X-ray observations. Such sources are also found in serendipitous
shallow X-ray surveys. There is a hint that the mean spectral slope of the red
quasar is higher than that of normal, unobscured quasars, which could be an

  the Identification of Emission Lines in the Ly alpha Forest","29 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the variety in quasar UV spectra (1020-1600A) with emphasis on
the weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest region using principal component
analysis (PCA). This paper is a continuation of Suzuki et al. (2005, Paper I),
but with a different approach. We use 50 smooth continuum fitted quasar spectra
(0.14 < z < 1.04) taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object
Spectrograph. Three weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest are identified
as FeII 1070.95A, FeII+FeIII 1123.17A, and CIII* 1175.88A. Using first two
standardized PCS coefficients, we introduce five classifications: Class Zero
and Class I-IV. These classifications will guide us in finding the continuum
level in the Ly alpha forest, and we discuss the characteristics of each class.
We show weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest become eminent for Class III
and IV. By actively using PCS, we can generate artificial quasar spectra which
are useful to test the detection of quasars, DLAs, and the continuum
calibration. We provide 10,000 artificially generated spectra. We show that the
power-law extrapolated continuum is inadequate to perform precise measurements
of the mean flux in the Ly alpha forest because of the weak emission lines and
the extended tails of Ly alpha and Ly beta/OVI emission lines. We introduce a
correction factor dF such that the true mean flux <F> can be related to
<F_{Power-Law}> that is measured by using power-law continuum extrapolation:
<F> = <F_{Power-Law}> dF. The correction factor dF ranges from 0.84 to 1.05
with a mean of 0.947 and a standard deviation of 0.031 for our 50 quasars. This
result means that we miss 5.3% of flux on average and we show that there are
cases where we would miss 16% of flux using a power-law extrapolation.

times and redshifts, we compared the pseudo jet opening half-angle with the
standard one and found that the differences are within a factor 2. We apply the

the spatial distributions of the scattering dust grains along the line of

close to these sources is much higher than the normal interstellar medium. For
X-ray pulsars GX 301-2 and Vela X-1 with companions of strong stellar winds,
the X-ray absorption column densities are much higher than the derived
scattering column densities, because of the dense media around the X-ray

X-1, most of the scattering and absorption occur in Large Magellanic Cloud,

absorption and thus the quivalent hydrogen column is determined. We have
obtained the linear correlation between $N_{H}$ derived from spectral fits and

system with solar characteristics, UX Arietis, and performed a timing analysis

a 294-day cycle. When the two 9-year datasets are folded with this period, a
synchronization of the peak of the optical light curve (i.e., the minimum spot

relationship between two completly independent curves makes it very likely that
the 294-day cycle is real. We conclude that the process invoked for the Sun of

can explain the cyclic flaring activity triggered by interactions between
successive cyclic emergences of magnetic flux.

July. Bo 158 was the first dipping LMXB to be discovered in M31. Periodic
intensity dips were previously seen to occur on a 2.78-hr period, due to
absorption in material that is raised out of the plane of the accretion disc.
The report of these observations stated that the dip depth was anti-correlated
with source intensity. However, our new observations do not favour a strict
intensity dependance, but rather suggest that the dip variation is due to
precession of the accretion disc. This is to be expected in LMXBs with a mass
ratio <~ 0.3 (period <~ 4 hr), as the disc reaches the 3:1 resonance with the
binary companion, causing elongation and precession of the disc. A smoothed
particle hydrodynamics simulation of the disc in this system shows retrograde
rotation of a disc warp on a period of ~11 P_orb, and prograde disc precession
on a period of ~29 P_orb. This is consistent with the observed variation in the
depth of the dips. We find that the dipping behaviour is most likely to be
modified by the disc precession, hence we predict that the dipping behaviour

the moderately metal-rich Galactic globular cluster M62 (NGC 6266), which
places it among the top three most RR Lyrae-rich globular clusters known.
Likely members of the cluster in our studied field, from our preliminary number
counts, include about 130 fundamental-mode (RRab) pulsators, with <P(ab)> =
0.548 d, and about 75 first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, with <P(c)> = 0.300 d.
The average periods and the position of the RRab variables with well-defined
light curves in the Bailey diagram both suggest that the cluster is of
Oosterhoff type I. However, the morphology of the cluster's horizontal branch
(HB) is strikingly similar to that of the Oosterhoff type II globular cluster
M15 (NGC 7078), with a dominant blue HB component and a very extended blue
tail. Since M15 and M62 differ in metallicity by about one dex, we conclude
that metallicity, at a fixed HB type, is a key parameter determining the
Oosterhoff status of a globular cluster and the position of its variables in
the Bailey diagram.

relevant rise must occur in subphotospheric layers reaching to some 0.5 - 0.7
kG at a depth of about 5 Mm. However, the implied constraints also require the
field change in the atmosphere to be so small that it has only a tiny dynamical
effect on p-mode frequencies. For p-modes, the most plausible explanation of
the frequency increase is a less than 2 percent decrease in the radial
component of the turbulent velocity in the outer layers. Lower velocity implies
a lower efficiency of the convective transport, hence lower temperature, which
also contributes to the p-mode frequency increase.

addressed via second-order {\it cell} strong coupling perturbative expansions

partition inherent in the complex periodic modulation of a superlattice, this
technique allows for the description of the unusual loophole-shaped insulator
domains that may occur in the phase diagram of the system, unlike the standard
perturbative approach. Furthermore, comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo

at a significantly lower computational cost than brute force numerical methods.
We explicitly consider the phase diagrams for two realistic 3-periodic optical

reentrant character, which we discuss, and suggest that the quantum phase
transition relevant to the loophole-shaped insulating domains does not require
extreme experimental condition in order to be observed.

have degenerate ground states with either clockwise or counter-clockwise
spontaneous circulating supercurrents. The final flux state of each ring in the

fabricated as a single junction with facets alternating between alignment
parallel to a [100] axis of the YBCO and rotated 90 degrees to that axis,
half-fluxon Josephson vortices order strongly into an arrangement with
alternating signs of their magnetic flux. We demonstrate that this ordering is
driven by phase coupling and model the cooling process with a numerical
solution of the Sine-Gordon equation. The 2D ring arrays couple to each other
through the magnetic flux generated by the spontaneous supercurrents. Using
pi-rings for the 2D flux coupling experiments eliminates one source of disorder
seen in similar experiments using conventional superconducting rings, since
pi-rings have doubly degenerate ground states in the absence of an applied
field. Although anti-ferromagnetic ordering occurs, with larger negative bond
orders than previously reported for arrays of conventional rings, long-range
order is never observed, even in geometries without geometric frustration. This
may be due to dynamical effects. Monte-Carlo simulations of the 2D array

earlier papers to the calculation of the free energy of symmetrically layered
electrolytic systems which is based on the Sine-Gordon field theory for the
Coulomb gas. The method is to construct the partition function in terms of the
Feynman evolution kernel in the Euclidean time variable associated with the
coordinate normal to the surfaces defining the layered structure. The theory is
applicable to cylindrical systems and its development is motivated by the
possibility that a static van der Waals or thermal Casimir force could provide
an attractive force stabilising a dielectric tube formed from a lipid bilayer,
an example of which are t-tubules occurring in certain muscle cells. In this
context, we apply the theory to the calculation of the thermal Casimir effect
for a dielectric tube of radius $R$ and thickness $\delta$ formed from such a
membrane in water. In a grand canonical approach we find that the leading
contribution to the Casimir energy behaves like $-k_BTL\kappa_C/R$ which gives
rise to an attractive force which tends to contract the tube radius. We find
that $\kappa_C \sim 0.3$ for the case of typical lipid membrane t-tubules. We
conclude that except in the case of a very soft membrane this force is
insufficient to stabilise such tubes against the bending stress which tend to
increase the radius. We briefly discuss the role of lipid membrane reservoir
implicit in the approach and whether its nature in biological systems may
possibly lead to a stabilising mechanism for such lipid tubes.

eligible as a universal predictor in case of unknown mu. The first part of the
paper investigates the existence and convergence of computable universal

enumerable, and approximable. For instance, M is known to be enumerable, but
not estimable, and to dominate all enumerable semimeasures. We present proofs

post-Newtonian matter systems to d spatial dimensions, and apply it to point
masses (without spins), modelled by delta-function singularities. We find that
the quadrupole moment of point-particle binaries in harmonic coordinates
contains a pole when epsilon = d-3 -> 0 at the 3PN order. It is proved that the
pole can be renormalized away by means of the same shifts of the particle
world-lines as in our recent derivation of the 3PN equations of motion. The
resulting renormalized (finite when epsilon -> 0) quadrupole moment leads to
unique values for the ambiguity parameters xi, kappa and zeta, which were
introduced in previous computations using Hadamard's regularization. Several
checks of these values are presented. These results complete the derivation of
the gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling compact binaries up to the
3.5PN level of accuracy which is needed for detection and analysis of the
signals in the gravitational-wave antennas LIGO/VIRGO and LISA.

hope that exotic quantum effects would be amplified in their vicinities,

limited encouragement of this hope. The predicted corrections have been minor
(for macroscopic holes): weak fluxes of low-energy thermal radiation which
hardly disturb the classical structures of the holes. Here, I argue that this

among fields are taken into account (they were largely neglected in the earlier

radiation but also ultra-energetic quanta are produced in the gravitationally

that by the time the hole can be said to have formed, they have passed the

several examples of interest and point out that a combined measurement of

|V_ub| which is largely independent of shape function effects and in principle
allows a higher accuracy than the combined measurement of leptonic and hadronic
invariant masses. We perform the expansion directly in QCD light-cone

differential equation capable to describe relativistic particle with mass and
internal space-time structure. By making use of new variables that
differentiate between space-time particle position and its space-time
separations, one finds this wave equation to become separable and providing the
two kinds of solutions endowed with different physical meanings. The first kind
constitutes the running waves that represent Klein-Gordon-like particle. The
second kind, widely discussed by Kim and Noz [4], constitutes standing waves
which are normalizable space-time wave functions. To fully appreciate how
valuable theses solutions are it seems necessarily, however, to verify a
general outlook on relativity issue that (still) is in force. It was explained
[5] that Lorentz symmetry should be perceived rather as the symmetry of
preferred frame quantum description (based on the freedom of choice of
comparison scale) than classical Galilean idea realized in a generalized form.
Currently we point to some basic consequences that relate to solutions of
Feynman equation framed in the new approach. In particular (i) Lorentz symmetry
group appears to describe energy-dependent geometry of extended quantum objects
instead of relativity of space and time measure, (ii) a new picture of
particle-wave duality involving running and standing waves emerges, (iii)
space-time localized quantum states are shown to provide a new way of

ways. On the one hand, it can support a Coulomb field whose potential grows
logarithmically in the radial coordinate. On the other, due to the existence of
a non-contractible cycle, it also supports a topological charge whose value is
given by the corresponding Abelian holonomy. Only the Coulomb charge, however,
is given by a constant flux integral with an associated continuity equation.
The topological charge does not gravitate and is somehow decoupled from the
black hole. This situation changes abruptly if one turns on the Chern-Simons
term for the Maxwell field. First, the flux integral at infinity becomes equal
to the topological charge. Second, demanding regularity of the black hole
horizon, it is found that the Coulomb charge (whose associated potential now
decays by a power law) must vanish identically. Hence, in 2+1 topologically
massive electrodynamics coupled to gravity, the black hole can only support
holonomies for the Maxwell field. This means that the charged black hole, as
the uncharged one, is constructed from the vacuum by means of spacetime
identifications.

the effective action for $(N+1)$ D-instantons. We then calculate an effective

has a wave function of the antisymmetric tensor field. A fuzzy sphere becomes a
classical solution to the equation of motion for the effective action.

investigations on the resolutions of edge ideals usually reduced the problem to
computing the dimensions of reduced homology or Koszul homology groups. Our
approach circumvents the highly nontrivial problem of computing the dimensions
of these groups and turns the problem into combinatorial questions about the

of a constituent quark model. Both nonrelativistic and semirelativistic
Hamiltonians are used to obtain the baryon wave functions from a fit to the
spectra, and the wave functions are expanded in both the harmonic oscillator
and Sturmian bases. The latter basis leads to form factors in which the
kinematic dependence on q^2 is in the form of multipoles, and the resulting
form factors fall faster as a function of q^2 in the available kinematic
ranges. As a result, decay rates obtained in the two models using the Sturmian
basis are significantly smaller than those obtained using the harmonic
oscillator basis. In the case of the Lambda_c, decay rates calculated using the
Sturmian basis are closer to the experimentally reported rates. However, we
find a semileptonic branching fraction for the Lambda_c to decay to excited
Lambda* states of 11% to 19%, in contradiction with what is assumed in
available experimental analyses. Our prediction for the Lambda_b semileptonic
decays is that decays to the ground state Lambda_c provide a little less than

having applications in the physics of ultracold neutron (UCN) were recently
considered in ref. [Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65(3): 400 (2002)]; they were
motivated by the experimental observation of small changes in energy of UCN
upon their collisions with surface. The first hypothesis explaines the nature
of the observed phenomenon by inelastic coherent scattering of UCN on
nanoparticles weakly attached at surface, in a state of permanent thermal
motion. It got experimental confirmed in ref. [Physics of Atomic Nuclei 65(11):
1996 (2002)]. The second hypothesis inverts the problem of neutron interaction
with nanoparticles in the following sence. In all experiments with UCN, the
trap-wall temperature was much higher than a temperature of about 1 mK, which
corresponds to the UCN energy. Therefore, UCN preferentially increased their
energy. The surface density of weakly attached nanoparticles was low. If,
however, the nanoparticles temperature is lower than the neutron temperature
and if the nanoparticles density is high, the problem of interaction of
neutrons with nanoparticles is inverted. In this case, the neutrons can cool
down, under certain conditions, owing tot heir scattering on
ultracold-heavy-water, deuterium, and oxigen nanoparticles to their temperature
of about 1 mK, with result that the UCN density increases by many orders of
magnitude. In the present article we repeat the argumentation given in the
first mentioned article and formulate in a very general way the research
program in order to verify validity of this hypothesis. Both the theoretical
and the experimental investigation of the problem are going to intensify in the
near future.

on the gluonic breakup of $J/\psi$'s produced in an equilibrating parton
plasma. Attention is paid to the space-time inhomogeneities as well as Lorentz
frames while deriving new expressions for the gluon number density $n_g$,
average dissociation rate $<\tilde{\Gamma}>$, and $\psi$ survival probability
$S$. A novel type of partial wave {\em interference} mechanism is found to
operate in the formula of $<\tilde{\Gamma}>$. Nonrelativistic longitudinal
expansion fro small length of the initial cylinder is found to push the
$S(p_T)$ graph above the no flow case considered by us earlier \cite{rev1}.
However, relativistic flow corresponding to large length of the initial
cylinder pushes the curve of $S(p_T)$ downwards at LHC but upwards at RHIC.
This mutually different effect on $S(p_T)$ may be attributed to the different
initial temperatures generated at LHC and RHIC.

one often charges the particles electrically, e.g. by triboelectric charging.
Stabilization of suspensions against aggregation of particles is an important
issue, which may be realized by monopolar charging, where particles repel each
other. Contrarily, bipolar charging may be used in coating processes, where
smaller particles of one material coat larger particles of another material.
When the two particle fractions are charged oppositely, aggregation between
equally charged particles is hindered whereas aggregation between oppositely
charged particles is preferred, thereby improving the coating process. We study
various aspects of these two situations by theoretical investigations and
computer simulations.

approach, and investigate the structural and electronic properties of small

solid bilayered structure, typical of magnesium diboride, and the character of
the electronic sigma-band, arising from the overlap of the atomic orbitals in
the in-plane BC rings. Two aspects especially emphasized are (a) the HOMO-LUMO
gap as function of n and (b) the role of different spin multiplicity.
