estimate the jet kinetic luminosity from the measurement of the optically thin
radio lobe emission in quasars and radio galaxies. Motivated by recent X-ray
observation, the derivation assumes that most of the energy in the lobes is in
plasma thermal energy with a negligible contribution from magnetic energy (not
equipartition). The close agreement of the two independent expressions makes
the veracity of these estimates seem very plausible.

stellar kinematics, ages and chemical properties.Here examine our thick disk

between foreground mass and gravitational shear of background galaxies depends
upon the angular diameter distances d_A(z_l), d_A(z_s), and d_A(z_s,z_l) on the
degenerate triangle formed by observer, source, and lens. In a flat Universe,
d_A(z_l,z_s) = d_A(z_s)-d_A(z_l), but in curved Universes an additional term
$\propto\Omega_k$ alters the lensing observables even if d_A(z) is fixed. Weak
lensing data may be used to solve simultaneously for d_A and the curvature.
This method is completely insensitive to: the equation of state; amendments to
the General Relativity formulae for the deflection of light or the growth of
structure; or biases in the photometric redshift scale. There is however a
degeneracy among d_A, $\Omega_k$ and the galaxy bias factors, that can be
broken by using measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations with the same
imaging data. Ambitious weak-lensing + baryon-oscillation surveys would measure
$\Omega_k$ to an accuracy $\approx0.04 f_{\rm sky}^{-1/2} (\sigma_{\ln

also predict bounds on curvature and other parameters in the context of

additional phase transition in the vortex state. For a narrow range of
parameters, the chiral {\bf d}-vector gives rise to a tetracritical point in
the H-T phase diagram. When this tetracritical point exists, the resulting
phase diagram closely resembles the experimentally measured phase diagram for
which two transitions are only observed in the high field regime. For the

off-diagonal electron-phonon couplings are considered. It is observed that
strong diagonal EPI generate stripes in previously homogeneous states, while in
striped ground states an increase in the diagonal couplings tends to stabilize
the stripes, inducing a gap in the density of states (DOS) and rendering the
ground state insulating. The off-diagonal terms, on the other hand, destabilize
the stripes creating inhomogeneous ground states with a pseudogap at the
chemical potential in the DOS. The breathing mode stabilizes static diagonal
stripes; while the half-breathing (shear) modes stabilize dynamical (localized)
vertical and horizontal stripes. The EPI induces decoherence of the

model has an anisotropic limit, when the dimensionless ratio of two exchange
constants, J_\times/J << 1, in which it consists of one-dimensional spin chains
coupled weakly together in a frustrated fashion. Using recently developed
techniques combining renormalization group ideas and one-dimensional
bosonization and current algebra methods, we show that in this limit the model
enters a crossed dimer state with two-fold spontaneous symmetry breaking but no

turbulence is reconsidered. Using this description, we make predictions about
turbulent flow in a rapidly rotating laboratory annulus. Measurements on the
continuously forced, weakly dissipative flow reveal coherent vortices in a mean
zonal flow. Statistical mechanics has two crucial requirements for equilibrium:
statistical independence of macro-cells (subsystems) and additivity of
invariants of macro-cells. We use additivity to select the appropriate Casimir
invariants from the infinite set available in vortex dynamics, and we do this
in such a way that the exchange of micro-cells within a macro-cell does not
alter an invariant of a macro-cell. A novel feature of the present study is our
choice of macro-cells, which are continuous phase space curves based on mean
values of the streamfunction. Quantities such as energy and enstrophy can be
defined on each curve, and these lead to a local canonical distribution that is
also defined on each curve. Our approach leads to the prediction that on a mean
streamfunction curve there should be a linear relation between the
ensemble-averaged potential vorticity and the time-averaged streamfunction, and
our laboratory data are in good accord with this prediction. Further, the
approach predicts that although the probability distribution function for
potential vorticity in the entire system is non-Gaussian, the distribution
function of micro-cells should be Gaussian on the macro-cells, i.e., for curves
defined by mean values of the streamfunction. This prediction is also supported
by the data. While the statistical mechanics approach used was motivated by and
applied to experiments on turbulence in a rotating annulus, the approach is
quite general and is applicable to a large class of Hamiltonian systems.

  119-143",,,"hep-ph",,"  Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars and are the outcome of the
collapse of the core of a massive star with a mass of the order of or larger
than eight solar masses. This process releases a huge gravitational energy of
about 10^{53} erg, mainly in the form of neutrinos. During the collapse the
density increases, and so does the magnetic field due to the trapping of the
flux lines of the progenitor star by the high conductivity plasma. When the
density reaches a value of around 10^{12} g cm^{-3} neutrinos become trapped
within the protoneutron star and a neutrinosphere, characterized inside by a
diffusive transport of neutrinos and outside by a free streaming of neutrinos,
is formed and lasts for a few seconds. Here we focus on the structure of the
neutrinosphere, the resonant flavor conversion that can happen in its interior,
and the neutrino flux anisotropies induced by this phenomena in the presence of
a strong magnetic field. We present a detailed discussion in the context of the
spherical Eddington model, which provides a simple but reasonable description
of a static neutrino atmosphere, locally homogenous and isotropic. Energy and
momentum are transported by neutrinos and antineutrinos flowing through an
ideal gas of nonrelativistic, nondegenerate nucleons and relativistic,
degenerate electrons and positrons. We examine the details of the asymmetric
neutrino emission driven by active-sterile neutrino oscillations in the
magnetized protoneutron star, and the possibility for this mechanism to explain
the intrinsic large velocities of pulsars respect to nearby stars and
associated supernova remnants.

scheme from [Knutson '04] as a union of (N/2)! of its components. One of those
is a degeneration of the_commuting variety_ of pairs of commuting matrices.

generalized from numbers to polynomials, which allowed them to be calculated

curve. Thus we can view that the regularized determinant is the norm of a
section of some power of the line bundle of the classes of cohomologies of
(1,0) forms of the elliptic curves over its moduli space. Our purpose is to
generalize this fact in the case of CY manifolds. In this paper we will
establish the local analogue of the Kronecker limit formula for CY manifolds.

InGaAlAs optical waveguide gives rise to a very low driving voltage
electroabsorption modulator (EAM) at optical wavelengths around 1550 nm. The
presence of the RTD within the waveguide core introduces high non-linearity and
negative differential resistance in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of
the waveguide. This makes the electric field distribution across the waveguide
core strongly dependent on the bias voltage: when the current decreases from
the peak to the valley there is an increase of the electric field across the
depleted core. The electric field enhancement in the core-depleted layer causes
the Franz-Keldysh absorption band-edge to red shift, which is responsible for
the electroabsorption effect. High frequency ac signals as low as 100 mV can
induce electric field high speed switching, producing substantial light
modulation (up to 15 dB) at photon energies slightly lower than the waveguide
core band-gap energy. The key difference between this device and conventional
p-i-n EAMs is that the tunnelling characteristics of the RTD are employed to
switch the electric field across the core depleted region; the RTDEAM has in
essence an integrated electronic amplifier and therefore requires considerably
less switching power.

using constraint free density functional tight binding molecular dynamics
simulations. Independent from CNT diameter, squashing path can be divided into
{\it three} regimes. In the first regime, the nanotube deforms with negligible
force. In the second one, there is significantly more resistance to squashing
with the force being $\sim 40-100$ nN/per CNT unit cell. In the last regime,
the CNT looses its hexagonal structure resulting in force drop-off followed by
substantial force enhancement upon squashing. We compute the change in band-gap
as a function of squashing and our main results are: (i) A band-gap initially
opens due to interaction between atoms at the top and bottom sides of CNT. The
$\pi-$orbital approximation is successful in modeling the band-gap opening at
this stage. (ii) In the second regime of squashing, large $\pi-\sigma$
interaction at the edges becomes important, which can lead to band-gap
oscillation. (iii) Contrary to a common perception, nanotubes with broken
mirror symmetry can have {\it zero} band-gap. (iv) All armchair nanotubes
become metallic in the third regime of squashing. Finally, we discuss both
differences and similarities obtained from the tight binding and density
functional approaches.

  ed. B.J. Carr, for Cambridge U.P",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  Probabilistic models (developped by workers such as Boltzmann, on foundations
due to pioneers such as Bayes) were commonly regarded merely as approximations
to a deterministic reality before the roles were reversed by the quantum
revolution (under the leadership of Heisenberg and Dirac) whereby it was the
deterministic description that was reduced to the status of an approximation,
while the role of the observer became particularly prominent. The concomitant
problem of lack of objectivity in the original Copenhagen interpretation has
not been satisfactorily resolved in newer approaches of the kind pioneered by
Everett. The deficiency of such interpretations is attributable to failure to
allow for the anthropic aspect of the problem, meaning {\it a priori}
uncertainty about the identity of the observer. The required reconciliation of
subjectivity with objectivity is achieved here by distinguishing the concept of
an observer from that of a perceptor, whose chances of identification with a
particular observer need to be prescribed by a suitable anthropic principle. It
is proposed that this should be done by an entropy ansatz according to which
the relevant micro-anthropic weighting is taken to be proportional to the
logarithm of the relevant number of Everett type branch-channels.

problems of group-theoretical nature in quantum computing such as order finding
and the discrete logarithm problem. While it is known that Fourier sampling
provides an efficient solution in the abelian case, not much is known for
general non-abelian groups. Recently, some authors raised the question as to
whether post-processing the Fourier spectrum by measuring in a random
orthonormal basis helps for solving the HSP. Several negative results on the
shortcomings of this random strong method are known. In this paper however, we
show that the random strong method can be quite powerful under certain
conditions on the group G. We define a parameter r(G) for a group G and show
that O((\log |G| / r(G))^2) iterations of the random strong method give enough
classical information to identify a hidden subgroup in G. We illustrate the
power of the random strong method via a concrete example of the HSP over finite
Heisenberg groups. We show that r(G) = \Omega(1) for these groups; hence the
HSP can be solved using polynomially many random strong Fourier samplings
followed by a possibly exponential classical post-processing without further
queries. The quantum part of our algorithm consists of a polynomial computation
followed by measuring in a random orthonormal basis. This gives the first
example of a group where random representation bases do help in solving the HSP
and for which no explicit representation bases are known that solve the problem
with (\log G)^O(1) Fourier samplings. As an interesting by-product of our work,
we get an algorithm for solving the state identification problem for a set of
nearly orthogonal pure quantum states.

interferometer should cause interference breakdown due to a quantum jump to one
of the two components of a photon mode. That effect goes back to Dirac. We
argue that the conventional reasoning is inadequate: First, it would be more
circumspect to interpret interference breakdown as being due to the
entanglement of the photon with the mirror, not referring to quantum jumps.
Second--and crucial--even in such an interpretation, the reasoning does not
take into account the uncertainty of the mirror momentum. The effect of the
entanglement and interference breakdown would take place if the uncertainty
were much less than the recoil momentum, which is of the order of the photon
momentum. However, an examination leads to the conclusion that for an actual
mirror the opposite situation occurs. Thus there should be no such effect.

generalized from integrable to non-integrable systems. In this approach, the
lost of information, usually conceived as the result of a coarse-graining or
the trace of an environment, is produced by a particular choice of the algebra
