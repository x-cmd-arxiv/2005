days (2002 May 23-30). Frequent phase and flux referencing (every 5 minutes)
with the nearby calibrator source J1744-312 was employed to control for
instrumental and atmospheric effects. Time variations are sought by computing
and subtracting, from each visibility in the database, an average visibility
obtained from all the data acquired in our monitoring program having similar uv
spacings. This removes the confusing effects of baseline-dependent, correlated
flux interference caused by the static, thermal emission from the extended
source Sgr A West. Few-day variations up to ~20% and intra-day variability of
\~20% and in some cases up to ~40% on few-hour time scales emerge from the
differenced data on SgrA*. Power spectra of the residuals indicate the presence
of hourly variations on all but two of the eight days. Monte Carlo simulation
of red-noise light curves indicates that the hourly variations are well
described by a red-noise power spectrum with P(f) ~ f^(-1). Of particular
interest is a ~2.5 hour variation seen prominently on two consecutive days. An
average power spectrum from all eight days of data reveals noteworthy power on
this time scale. There is some indication that few-hour variations are more
pronounced on days when the average daily flux is highest. We briefly discuss
the possibility that these few-hour variations are due to the dynamical
modulation of accreting gas around the central supermassive black hole, as well
as the implications for the structure of the SgrA* photosphere at 3 mm.
Finally, these data have enabled us to produce a high sensitivity 3-mm map of
the extended thermal emission surrounding SgrA*.

of the zone of avoidance (Henning et al. 2000). Follow up VLA as well as
optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy (Massey et al. 2003; Silva et al.
2005) confirm that it is a low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy. However
there were two puzzling aspects of the observations, (i) current star
formation, as traced by H$\alpha$ emission, is confined to a small region at
the edge of the VLA HI image and (ii) the metallicity of the older RGB stars is
higher than that of the gas in HII region. We present high spatial and velocity
resolution Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations that resolve
these puzzles by showing that HIZSS003 is actually a galaxy pair and that the
HII region lies at the center of a much smaller companion galaxy (HIZSS003B) to
the main galaxy (HIZSS003A). The HI emission from these two galaxies overlaps
in projection, but can be separated in velocity space. HIZSS003B has an HI mass
of 2.6 X 10^6 M$_\odot$, and a highly disturbed velocity field. Since the
velocity field is disturbed, an accurate rotation curve cannot be derived,
however, the indicative dynamical mass is ~5 X 10^7 M$_\odot$. For the bigger
galaxy HIZSS003A we derive an HI mass of 1.4 X 10^7 M$_\odot$. The velocity
field of this galaxy is quite regular and from its rotation curve we derive a
total dynamical mass of ~6.5 X 10^8 M$_\odot$.

  available at http://alfa.ist.utl.pt/~cvrm/staff/vramos/ref_59.html",,,,"nlin.AO",,"  Swarm Intelligence (SI) is the property of a system whereby the collective
behaviors of (unsophisticated) entities interacting locally with their
environment cause coherent functional global patterns to emerge. SI provides a
basis with wich it is possible to explore collective (or distributed) problem
solving without centralized control or the provision of a global model. In this
paper we present a Swarm Search Algorithm with varying population of agents.
The swarm is based on a previous model with fixed population which proved its
effectiveness on several computation problems. We will show that the variation
of the population size provides the swarm with mechanisms that improves its
self-adaptability and causes the emergence of a more robust self-organized
behavior, resulting in a higher efficiency on searching peaks and valleys over
dynamic search landscapes represented here - for the purpose of different
experiments - by several three-dimensional mathematical functions that suddenly
change over time. We will also show that the present swarm, for each function,
self-adapts towards an optimal population size, thus self-regulating.

Using the Hone's method, based on the use of the Laurent-series solutions and

Hone's result, that this equation has no elliptic travelling wave solutions.

observation of Cherenkov or scintillation light it is common to use pairs or
arrays of photomultipliers operated in coincidence. In such circumstances, for
instance in dark matter and neutrino experiments, unexpected PMT noise events
have been observed, probably arising from generation of light from one PMT
being detected by one or more other PMTs. We describe here experimental
investigation of such coincident noise events and development of new techniques
to remove them using novel pulse shape discrimination procedures. When applied
to data from a low background NaI detector with facing PMTs the new procedures
are found to improve noise rejection by a factor of 20 over conventional
techniques, with significantly reduced loss of signal events.

with the help of Lifshitz formula depending upon permittivity of media. We will
show that this formula is in contradiction with experimental evidence for
excited atoms. We calculate Casimir force between two atoms if one of them or
both atoms are excited. We use methods of quantum electrodynamics specially
derived for the problem. It enables us to take into account excited-state
radiation widths of atoms. Then we calculate the force between excited atom and
medium of ground-state atoms. The results are in agreement with the ones,
obtained by other authors using perturbation theory or linear response theory.
Generalization of our results to the case of interaction between two media of
excited atoms results in a formula, which is in not only in quantitative, but
in qualitative contradiction with Lifshits formula. This contradiction
disappears if media of ground-state atoms are taken. Moreover, our result does
not include permittivity of the media. It includes the quantity which differs
from the permittivity only for excited atoms. The main features of our results
are as follows. The interaction is resonant; the force may be either attractive
or repulsive depending on resonant frequencies of the atoms of different media;
the value of Casimir force may be several orders of magnitude lager than that
predicted by Lifshitz formula. The features mentioned here are in agreement
with known experimental and theoretical evidences obtained by many authors for
interaction of a single excited atom with dielectric media.
