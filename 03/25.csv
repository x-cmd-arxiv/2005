interferometer of the 6m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope. In
addition to the previously known expansion of the system of bright filaments
with a velocity of 100-200km/s, we detected weak high-velocity features in the
H-alpha line at least up to velocities of 400-450km/s. We analyzed the
morphology of the PWN in the H-alpha, [SII], and [OIII] lines using HST data
and discuss its nature. The shape of the central filamentary shell, which is
determined by the emission in the [OIII] line and in the radio continuum, is
shown to be consistent with the bow-shock model for a significant (about 60
degrees) inclination of the pulsar's velocity vector to the plane of the sky.
In this case, the space velocity of the pulsar is twice higher than its
tangential velocity, i.e., it reaches ~500 km/s, and PSR B1951+32 is the first
pulsar whose line-of-sight velocity (of about 400 km/s) has been estimated from
the PWN observations. The shell-like H-alpha-structures outside the bow shock
front in the east and the west may be associated with both the pulsar's jets
and the pulsar-wind breakthrough due to the layered structure of the extended
CTB 80 shell.

neutral-neutral reactions. The ability of CO molecules to self-shield
significantly enhances its abundance. Water molecules are sufficiently abundant

white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable (CV). As such, they are probes of the
mass transfer rate, Mdot, and WD mass, Mwd, in these interacting binaries. Our
calculations of the dependence of the CN ignition mass, Mign, on Mdot and Mwd
yields the recurrence times of these explosions. We show that the observed CNe
orbital period distribution is consistent with the interrupted magnetic braking
evolutionary scenario, where at orbital periods Porb > 3 hr mass transfer is
driven by angular momentum loss via a wind from the companion star and at Porb
< 3 hr by gravitational radiation. About 50% of CNe occur in binaries accreting
at Mdot ~= 10^{-9} Msun/yr with Porb = 3-4 hr, with the remaining 50% split
evenly between Porb longer (higher Mdot) and shorter (lower Mdot) than this.
This resolution of the relative contribution to the CN rate from different CVs
tells us that 3(9)x10^5 CVs with WD mass 1.0(0.6)Msun are needed to produce one
CN per year. Using the K-band specific CN rate measured in external galaxies,
we find a CV birthrate of 2(4)x10^{-4}/yr per 10^{10}Lsun,K, very similar to
the luminosity specific Type Ia supernova rate in elliptical galaxies.
Likewise, we predict that there should be 60-180 CVs for every 10^6Lsun,K in an
old stellar population, similar to the number of X-ray identified CVs in the
globular cluster 47 Tuc, showing no overabundance relative to the field. Using
a two-component steady state model of CV evolution we show that the fraction of
CVs which are magnetic (22%) implies a birthrate of 8% relative to non-magnetic
CVs, similar to the fraction of strongly magnetic field WDs. (abridged)

B 72, 115331 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevB.72.115331",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We have studied the origin of switching (telegraph) noise at low temperature
in lateral quantum structures defined electrostatically in GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructures by surface gates. The noise was measured by monitoring the
conductance fluctuations around $e^2/h$ on the first step of a quantum point
contact at around 1.2 K. Cooling with a positive bias on the gates dramatically
reduces this noise, while an asymmetric bias exacerbates it. We propose a model
in which the noise originates from a leakage current of electrons that tunnel
through the Schottky barrier under the gate into the doped layer. The key to
reducing noise is to keep this barrier opaque under experimental conditions.
Bias cooling reduces the density of ionized donors, which builds in an
effective negative gate voltage. A smaller negative bias is therefore needed to
reach the desired operating point. This suppresses tunnelling from the gate and
hence the noise. The reduction in the density of ionized donors also
strengthens the barrier to tunneling at a given applied voltage. Support for
the model comes from our direct observation of the leakage current into a
closed quantum dot, around $10^{-20} \mathrm{A}$ for this device. The current
was detected by a neighboring quantum point contact, which showed monotonic
steps in time associated with the tunneling of single electrons into the dot.
If asymmetric gate voltages are applied, our model suggests that the noise will
increase as a consequence of the more negative gate voltage applied to one of

both to finite and even small systems and also to the largest, self-gravitating
ones. However, one must reconsider the fundamental principles of statistical
mechanics especially its key quantity, entropy. Whereas in conventional
thermostatistics, the homogeneity and extensivity of the system and the
concavity of its entropy are central conditions, these fail for the systems
considered here. For example, at phase separation, the entropy, S(E), is
necessarily convex to make exp[S(E)-E/T] bimodal in E. Particularly, as
inhomogeneities and surface effects cannot be scaled away, one must be careful
with the standard arguments of splitting a system into two subsystems, or
bringing two systems into thermal contact with energy or particle exchange. Not
only the volume part of the entropy must be considered. As will be shown here,
when removing constraints in regions of a negative heat capacity, the system
may even relax under a flow of heat (energy) against a temperature slope. Thus
the Clausius formulation of the second law: ``Heat always flows from hot to
cold'', can be violated. Temperature is not a necessary or fundamental control
parameter of thermostatistics. However, the second law is still satisfied and
the total Boltzmann entropy increases. In the final sections of this paper, the
general microscopic mechanism leading to condensation and to the convexity of
the microcanonical entropy at phase separation is sketched. Also the
microscopic conditions for the existence (or non-existence) of a critical
end-point of the phase-separation are discussed. This is explained for the
liquid-gas and the solid-liquid transition.

conduction of localized charge carriers. The hopping process is limited to low
frequencies only, and a cutoff frequency nu_1 ~ 8 meV must be introduced for a
self-consistent description. On heating through the Verwey transition the
low-frequency dielectric constant abruptly decreases and becomes negative.
Together with the conductivity spectra this indicates a formation of a narrow
Drude-peak with a characteristic scattering rate of about 5 meV containing only
a small fraction of the available charge carriers. The spectra can be explained
assuming the transformation of the spectral weight from the hopping process to
the free-carrier conductivity. These results support an interpretation of

the driving mechanism of the confinement-deconfinement phase transition at

instantons at very large chemical potential in the weak coupling regime are
localized configurations with finite size rho~1/mu. At the same time, the same
instantons at smaller chemical potential in the strong coupling regime are well
represented by the so-called instanton-quarks with fractional topological

phase transition takes place as a function of temperature in the domain where
our approach is justified. In this picture, the long standing problem of the
""accidental"" coincidence of the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions at
nonzero temperature (observed in lattice simulations) is naturally resolved. We
also derive results at nonzero isospin chemical potential mu_I where direct
lattice calculations are possible, and our predictions can be explicitly

the potential into a region where it is no longer valid. Stability turns out to
be an intrinsic property of the theory (rather than an additional constraint to
be imposed on it). However, lower bounds for the Higgs mass can still be
derived with the help of a criterium dictated by the properties of the
potential itself. If the scale of new physics lies in the Tev region, sizeable
differences with the usual bounds are found. Finally, our results exclude the
alternative meta-stability scenario, according to which we might be living in a

introducing a cosmological constant on the brane. The mass of the discrete mode
for the spin-2 graviton is calculated for various $Hr_c$, where $H$ is the
Hubble parameter and $r_c$ is the cross-over scale determined by the ratio
between the 5D Newton constant and the 4D Newton constant. We show that, if we
introduce a positive cosmological constant on the brane ($Hr_c >1$), the spin-2
graviton has mass in the range $0 < m^2 < 2H^2$ and there is a normalisable
brane fluctuation mode with mass $m^2=2 H^2$. Although the brane fluctuation
mode is healthy, the spin-2 graviton has a helicity-0 excitation that is a
ghost. If we allow a negative cosmological constant on the brane, the brane
bending mode becomes a ghost for $1/2 < Hr_c <1$. This confirms the results
obtained by the boundary effective action that there exists a scalar ghost mode
for $Hr_c >1/2$. In a self-accelerating universe $Hr_c=1$, the spin-2 graviton
has mass $m^2=2H^2$, which is known to be a special case for massive gravitons
in de Sitter spacetime where the graviton has no helicity-0 excitation and so
no ghost. However, in DGP model, there exists a brane fluctuation mode with the
same mass and there arises a mixing between the brane fluctuation mode and the
spin-2 graviton. We argue that this mixing presumably gives a ghost in the
self-accelerating universe by continuity across $Hr_c=1$, although a careful
calculation of the effective action is required to verify this rigorously.

worldsheet action in the sector with two angular momenta with the continuum
limit of the coherent state action of an anisotropic XXZ spin chain describing
the one-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding operators and find a
remarkable agreement for all values of the deformation parameter. We discuss
some of the properties of the Bethe Ansatz for this spin chain, solve the Bethe
equations for small number of excitations and comment on higher loop properties
of the dilatation operator. With the goal of going beyond the leading order in
the 't Hooft expansion we derive the analog of the Bethe equations on the
string-theory side, and show that they coincide with the thermodynamic limit of
the Bethe equations for the spin chain. We also compute the 1/J corrections to
the anomalous dimensions of operators with large R-charge (corresponding to
strings with angular momentum J) and match them to the 1-loop corrections to
the fast string energies. Our results suggest that the impressive agreement

to a fixed sales cost and an exponential discounting rate \rho. We assume that
the price of the stock fluctuates according to the equation dY_t=Y_t(\mu

with values in {\pm1}, with an exponential renewal time. We determine the
critical value of \rho under which the value function is finite. We examine the
validity of the ``principle of smooth fit'' and use this to give a complete and
essentially explicit solution to the problem, which exhibits a surprisingly
rich structure. The corresponding result when the stock price evolves according
to the Black and Scholes model is obtained as a limit case.

changes of the bi-partite entanglement between atoms at critical values

discontinuities of the first derivative of the energy of the ground state. We
show that in a weak-coupling limit ($\kappa_1\leq \kappa \leq \kappa_2$) the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequalities are saturated which proves that for
these values of the coupling no intrinsic multipartite entanglement (neither
among the atoms nor between the atoms and the field) is generated by the
atom-field interaction. We analyze also the atom-field entanglement and we show
that in the strong-coupling limit the field is entangled with the atoms so that
the von Neumann entropy of the atomic sample (that serves as a measure of the
atom-field entanglement) takes the value $S_A={1/2}\ln (N+1)$. The entangling
interaction with atoms leads to a highly sub-Poissonian photon statistics of

demonstrate the particle behaviour of light and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer

feature of these experiments is the use of a gating system to produce near
ideal single photon states. With the demonstration of both wave and particle
behaviour (in two mutually exclusive experiments) they claim to have
demonstrated the dual particle-wave behaviour of light and hence to have
confirmed Bohr's principle of complementarity. The demonstration of the wave
behaviour of light is not in dispute. But we want to demonstrate, contrary to
the claims of GRA, that their beam-splitter experiment does not conclusively
confirm the particle behaviour of light, and hence does not confirm
particle-wave duality, nor, more generally, does it confirm complementarity.

probability distributions related to the first order term of the error rate on
the quantum counting with the depolarizing channel. We also implement two
circuits for the quantum counting -- the ascending-order circuit and the
descending-order circuit -- by reversing ordering of application of
controlled-Grover operations. By theoretical and numerical calculations for
probability distributions, we reveal the difference of probability
distributions on two circuits in the presence of decoherence and show that the
ascending-order circuit is more robust against the decoherence than the
descending-order circuit. This property of the robustness is applicable to the
phase estimation such as the factoring.
