Hunter","Power Spectra in V-band and Halpha of Nine Irregular Galaxies","To be published in AJ, May 2005",,"10.1086/429678",,"astro-ph",,"  Fourier transform power spectra of major axis cuts in V and Halpha images
were made for a sample of 9 irregular galaxies. These power spectra reveal
structure over a wide range of scales. For 6 of the galaxies the power spectrum
slopes at intermediate scales (1-400 pc) in the V-band images range from -1.3
to -1.5. The similarity of slopes suggests that the same processes are
structuring these systems. These slopes are slightly shallower than what is
observed in other galaxies in HI, molecular emission, dust extinction, and
optical light. Three of the galaxies have flat power spectra like noise from
the sky; these three galaxies are relatively indistinct in the direct images.
The power spectrum slope for Halpha steepens with increasing star formation
rate, ranging from a shallow value comparable to the noise at low rates to a
steep value with a slope of -1.5 at high rates. This change reflects the
increasing areal filling factor of Halpha emission with increasing star
formation rate, and an apparently universal slope inside the Halpha regions
that is comparable to that for Kolmogorov turbulence. The power spectrum of HI
in one galaxy has a steeper power law, with a slope of -2.9. The fact that the
power laws of star formation are about the same for dwarf galaxies and giant
spiral galaxies suggests the microscopic processes are the same, independent of
spiral density waves and galaxy size.

and physical origin of the red edge and summarize its use in astronomy: early
spectroscopic efforts to search for vegetation on Mars and recent reports of
detection of the red edge in the spectrum of Earthshine (i.e., the spatially
integrated scattered light spectrum of Earth). We present Earthshine
observations from Apache Point Observatory to emphasize that time variability
is key to detecting weak surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge.
We briefly discuss the evolutionary advantages of vegetation's red edge
reflectance, and speculate that while extraterrestrial ""light harvesting
organisms"" have no compelling reason to display the exact same red edge feature
as terrestrial vegetation, they might have similar spectroscopic features at
different wavelengths than terrestrial vegetation. This implies that future
terrestrial-planet-characterizing space missions should obtain data that allow
time-varying, sharp spectral features at unknown wavelengths to be identified.
We caution that some mineral reflectance edges are similar in slope and
strength to vegetation's red edge (albeit at different wavelengths); if an
extrasolar planet reflectance edge is detected care must be taken with its
interpretation.

component. The latter is modeled using published UBVRI light curves of SN
1998bw as a template. The total sample of afterglows with established redshifts
contains now 29 bursts (GRB 970228 - GRB 041006). For 13 of them a weak

The general lack of a detection of a supernova component at larger redshifts

  version after language edition",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20052631",,"astro-ph",,"  We quantify the degree of lopsidedness for a sample of 149 galaxies observed
in the near-infrared from the OSUBGS sample, and try to explain the physical
origin for the observed disk lopsidedness. We confirm previous studies, but now
for a larger sample, that a large fraction of galaxies show significant
lopsidedness in their stellar disks, measured as the Fourier amplitude of the
m=1 component, normalised to the average or m=0 component, in the surface
density. Late-type galaxies are found to be more lopsided, while the presence
of m=2 spiral arms and bars is correlated. The m=1 amplitude is found to be
uncorrelated with the tidal forces acting on a galaxy via nearby companions.
Numerical simulations are carried out to study the generation of m=1 via
different processes: galaxy tidal encounters, galaxy mergers, and external gas
accretion and subsequent star formation. The simulations show that galaxy
interactions and mergers can trigger strong lopsidedness, but do not explain
several independent statistical properties of observed galaxies. To explain all
the observational results, it is required that a large fraction of lopsidedness
results from cosmological accretion of gas on galactic disks, which can create
strongly lopsided disks when this accretion is asymmetrical enough.

transition from antiferromagnetic (AF) as-grown PLCCO to superconductivity

pure Ar at different temperatures, which also induces an epitaxial
(Pr,La,Ce)2O3 phase as an impurity. When the superconductivity first appears in
PLCCO, a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) spin-density-wave (SDW) order is also
induced, and both coexist with the residual three-dimensional (3D) AF state. A
magnetic field applied along the [-1,1,0] direction parallel to the CuO2 plane
induces a ``spin-flop'' transition, where the noncollinear AF spin structure of
PLCCO is transformed into a collinear one. The spin-flop transition is
continuous in semiconducting PLCCO, but gradually becomes sharp with increasing
doping and the appearance of superconductivity. A c-axis aligned magnetic field
that suppresses the superconductivity also enhances the quasi-2D SDW order at
(0.5,0.5,0) for underdoped PLCCO. However, there is no effect on the 3D AF
order in either superconducting or nonsuperconducting samples. Since the same
field along the [-1,1,0] direction in the CuO2 plane has no (or little) effect

that these discrepancies are due to strong electronic correlations by studying
the multi-orbital Hubbard model in the Hartree-Fock and strong-coupling
Gutzwiller approximation. The quasiparticle dispersion and the Fermi surface

stub. Both models are phenomenological ways to introduce decoherence in chaotic
scattering by a quantum dot. The difference is that the dephasing lead opens up
the quantum dot by connecting it to an electron reservoir, while the dephasing
stub is closed at one end. Voltage fluctuations in the stub take over the
dephasing role from the reservoir. Because the quantum dot with dephasing lead
is an open system, only expectation values of the current can be forced to
vanish at low frequencies, while the outcome of an individual measurement is
not so constrained. The quantum dot with dephasing stub, in contrast, remains a
closed system with a vanishing low-frequency current at each and every
measurement. This difference is a crucial one in the context of quantum
algorithms, which are based on the outcome of individual measurements rather
than on expectation values. We demonstrate that the dephasing stub model has a
parameter range in which the voltage fluctuations are sufficiently strong to
suppress quantum interference effects, while still being sufficiently weak that
classical current fluctuations can be neglected relative to the nonequilibrium
shot noise.

Well established synchronization techniques suffer from an inherent scalability
problem in that synchronization errors grow with an increasing number of hops

networks is first developed, and then the model is used to define a new time
synchronization mechanism. A salient feature of the proposed method is that, in
the regime of asymptotically dense networks, it can average out all random
errors and maintain global synchronization in the sense that all nodes in the
multi-hop network can see identical timing signals. This is irrespective of the
distance separating any two nodes.

aggregate conjunctive queries under different semantics. We provide sharp
complexity bounds, identify relevant tractable cases; and introduce
approximation algorithms for some of those that are intractable. More

aggregation constraints; MAXSNP-hardness of DFP, but a good approximation
algorithm for a relevant special case; and intractability but good
approximation for CQA for aggregate queries for one database atom denials (plus
built-ins).

based on a qualitative analysis of intersecting lightrays and thus avoids the
need for explicit transformations of the spacetime metric. To demonstrate the
power and simplicity of this method, I present derivations of diagrams for
spacetimes of varying complication. I then apply the lightray method to three
different models of an eternally inflating universe (scalar-field inflation,

nested asymptotically flat, de Sitter and/or anti-de Sitter bubbles. I show
that the resulting diagrams contain a characteristic fractal arrangement of

instabilities. This happens without entropy production which makes it very
interesting for the phenomenology of high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

out that, when describing a generic decay amplitude, the two weak phases can be

which several vacuum states with the same energy density exist in Nature. The
MPP is implemented to the Standard Model (SM), Family replicated gauge group
model (FRGGM) and phase transitions in gauge theories with/without monopoles.
Lattice gauge theories are reviewed. The lattice results for critical coupling
constants are compared with those of the Higgs Monopole Model (HMM), in which
the lattice artifact monopoles are replaced by the point-like Higgs scalar
particles with a magnetic charge. Considering our (3+1)-dimensional space-time
as discrete, for example, as a lattice with a parameter a=\lambda_P, equal to
the Planck length, we have investigated the additional contributions of
monopoles to beta-functions of renormalization group equations in the FRGGM
extended beyond the SM at high (the Planck scale) energies. We have reviewed
that, in contrast to the Anti-grand unified theory (AGUT), there exists a
possibility of unification of all gauge interactions (including gravity) near
the Planck scale due to monopoles. The unifications [SU(5)]^3 and [SO(10)]^3 at
the GUT-scale \sim 10^{18} GeV are briefly discussed.

this approach is especially natural on the level of the quark substructure of
hadrons. In this paper we point out the advantages of calculating these

normalizable, the high energy density of states is given by the Cardy formula

non-normalizable, c_{eff}<c, and high energy states correspond to long strings
that extend to the boundary of AdS3 and become more and more weakly coupled
there. A similar picture is found in asymptotically linear dilaton spacetime
with dilaton gradient Q=\sqrt{2/k}. The entropy grows linearly with the energy
in this case (for k>\half). The states responsible for this growth are two
dimensional black holes for k>1, and highly excited perturbative strings living
in the linear dilaton throat for k<1. The change of behavior at k=1 in the two
cases is an example of a string/black hole transition. The entropies of black
holes and strings coincide at k=1.

group that both intersects every connected component of Symp(M) and
characterizes symplectic bundles with fiber M and closed connection form. As a
consequence, it is shown that bundles with closed connection form are stable
under appropriate small perturbations of the symplectic form. Further, the
manifold (M,\omega) has the property that every symplectic M-bundle has a
closed connection form if and only if the flux group vanishes and the flux
homomorphism extends to a crossed homomorphism defined on the whole group

  Classical concepts known for H^n and negatively curved manifolds are defined
in a precise way for any hyperbolic complex X, for example for a Cayley graph
of a Gromov hyperbolic group. We define a double difference, a cross-ratio and
horofunctions in the compactification X-bar= X union bdry X. They are
continuous, Isom(X)-invariant, and satisfy sharp identities. We characterize
the translation length of a hyperbolic isometry g in Isom(X).
  For any hyperbolic complex X, the symmetric join *X-bar of X-bar and the
(generalized) metric d* on it are defined. The geodesic flow space F(X) arises
as a part of *X-bar. (F(X),d*) is an analogue of (the total space of) the unit
tangent bundle on a simply connected negatively curved manifold. This flow
space is defined for any hyperbolic complex X and has sharp properties. We also
give a construction of the asymmetric join X*Y of two metric spaces.
  These concepts are canonical, i.e. functorial in X, and involve no
`quasi'-language. Applications and relation to the Borel conjecture and others
are discussed.

there is no nontrivial solution under global convexity assumption (e.g., when
$\Omega$ is star-shaped around 0). However, in contrast to the non-satisfactory
situation of the non-singular case, we show the existence of an infinite number
of solutions under an assumption of local strict concavity of $\partial \Omega$

curvatures of $\partial \Omega$ at 0 to be non-positive but not all vanishing.
We also show that the best constant in the Hardy-Sobolev inequality is attained
as long as the mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$ at 0 is negative, extending
the results of [21] and completing our result of [22] to include dimension 3.

have shown that these curves have very nice combinatorial properties, and they
have made a careful study of the even liaison classes of these curves. We build
on this work by showing that they are ""almost always"" componentwise linear,
i.e. their homogeneous ideals have the property that for any d, the degree d

describe the minimal free resolution of a tetrahedral curve, and in particular
we show that in any fixed even liaison class there are only finitely many

generic initial ideal (gin) of a tetrahedral curve. We produce the gin for
arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay tetrahedral curves and for minimal arithmetically

interesting: (i) There has been global warming since the end of the ""little ice
age"" around 1700. There is no statistically significant evidence of
acceleration of global warming since 1940. (ii) The increase of CO_2 in the
atmosphere, beginning around 1940, accurately tracks the burning of fossil
fuels. Burning all of the remaining economically viable reserves of oil, gas
and coal over the next 150 years or so will approximately double the
pre-industrial atmospheric concentration of CO_2. The corresponding increase in
the average temperature, due to the greenhouse effect, is quite uncertain:
between 1.3 and 4.8K. This increase of temperature is (partially?) offset by
the increase of aerosols and deforestation. (iii) Ice core samples indicate
that the pre-historic CO_2 concentration and temperature are well correlated.
We conclude that changes in the temperatures of the oceans are probably the
cause of the changes of pre-historic atmospheric CO_2 concentration. (iv) Data
suggests that large volcanic explosions can trigger transitions from glacial to
interglacial climates. (v) Most of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis in the
Amazon basin returns to the atmosphere due to aerobic decay.

attention is on a visual stimulus within the receptive field of a cortical
neuron, two distinct changes can occur: The firing rate of the neuron can
change and there can be an increase in the coherence between spikes and the
local field potential in the gamma-frequency range (30-50 Hz). The hypothesis
explored here is that these observed effects of attention could be a
consequence of changes in the synchrony of local interneuron networks. We
performed computer simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron driven by a
constant depolarizing current, I, representing visual stimulation and a
modulatory inhibitory input representing the effects of attention via local
interneuron networks. We observed that the neuron's firing rate and the
coherence of its output spike train with the synaptic inputs was modulated by
the degree of synchrony of the inhibitory inputs. The model suggest that the
observed changes in firing rate and coherence of neurons in the visual cortex
could be controlled by top-down inputs that regulated the coherence in the
activity of a local inhibitory network discharging at gamma frequencies.

  criteria","9 pages, corrected proof of rule 4","Open Syst. Inf. Dyn. 12, 331 (2005)",,,"quant-ph",,"  The so-called permutation separability criteria are simple operational
conditions that are necessary for separability of mixed states of multipartite
systems: (1) permute the indices of the density matrix and (2) check if the
trace norm of at least one of the resulting operators is greater than one. If
it is greater than one then the state is necessarily entangled. A shortcoming
of the permutation separability criteria is that many permutations give rise to
dependent separability criteria. Therefore, we introduce a necessary condition
for two permutations to yield independent criteria called combinatorical
independence. This condition basically means that the map corresponding to one
permutation cannot be obtained by concatenating the map corresponding to the
second permutation with a norm-preserving map. We characterize completely
combinatorically independent criteria, and determine simple permutations that
represent all independent criteria. The representatives can be visualized by
means of a simple graphical notation. They are composed of three basic
operations: partial transpose, and two types of so-called reshufflings. In
particular, for a four-partite system all criteria except one are composed of
partial transpose and only one type of reshuffling; the exceptional one
requires the second type of reshuffling. Furthermore, we show how to obtain
efficiently for every permutation a simple representative. This method allows

impurity. The fixed impurity plays a role as spin state filter that is employed
to concentrate entanglement between the scattering particle and the
unscattering particle. One Kondo impurity can entangle two noninteracting
scattering particles while one scattering particle can entangle two separate
noninteracting Kondo impurities.

system can be increased by sacrificing the coherence in ancillary degree of
freedom, which is induced by a local manipulation.

  systems and their dynamical generation in spin systems","(14 pages, 7 figures, RevTeX4)",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.72.022321",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider multi-qubit systems and relate quantitatively the problems of
generating cluster states with high value of concurrence of assistance, and
that of generating states with maximal bipartite entanglement. We prove an
upper bound for the concurrence of assistance. We consider dynamics of spin-1/2
systems that model qubits, with different couplings and possible presence of
magnetic field to investigate the appearance of the discussed entanglement
properties. We find that states with maximal bipartite entanglement can be
generated by an XY Hamiltonian, and their generation can be controlled by the
initial state of one of the spins. The same Hamiltonian is capable of creating
states with high concurrence of assistance with suitably chosen initial state.
We show that the production of graph states using the Ising Hamiltonian is
controllable via a single-qubit rotation of one spin-1/2 subsystem in the
initial multi-qubit state. We shown that the property of Ising dynamics to
convert a product state basis into a special maximally entangled basis is
temporally enhanced by the application of a suitable magnetic field. Similar
basis transformations are found to be feasible in the case of isotropic XY
couplings with magnetic field.

against the traditional approach to the thermal Casimir force between real
metals and in favor of one of the alternative approaches. The latter assumes
zero contribution from the transverse electric mode at zero frequency in
qualitative disagreement with unity as given by the thermal quantum field
theory for ideal metals. Those authors claim that their approach is consistent
with experiments as well as with thermodynamics. We demonstrate that these
conclusions are incorrect. We show specifically that their results are
contradicted by four recent experiments and also violate the third law of
thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem).
