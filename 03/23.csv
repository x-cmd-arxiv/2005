abundance ratios are constant in the two lobes of the outflow whereas CS/SO is
up to 6 times lower in the shocked gas of the East lobe than in the West one.
The comparison with the chemical model allows us to constrain the age of the
outflow produced by IRAS2 to >5e3yr. We find low densities and temperatures for
the outflow of IRAS2 (< 1e6 cm-3 and >70 K) from SO and SO2 emission probably
because the two molecules trace the cooled entrained material. The East lobe of
the outflow shows denser gas compared to the West lobe. We also discuss some

first report some progress in the understanding the dynamical phase of

have been motivated by the analysis of the short GRBs. In this context progress
has also been accomplished on establishing an absolute lower limit to the
irreducible mass of the black hole as well as on some critical considerations
about the relations of general relativity and the second law of thermodynamics.
We recall how this last issue has been one of the most debated in theoretical
physics in the past thirty years due to the work of Bekenstein and Hawking.
Following these conceptual progresses we analyze the vacuum polarization
process around an overcritical collapsing shell. We evidence the existence of a
separatrix and a dyadosphere trapping surface in the dynamics of the
electron-positron plasma generated during the process of gravitational
collapse. We then analyze, using recent progress in the solution of the
Vlasov-Boltzmann-Maxwell system, the oscillation regime in the created
electron-positron plasma and their rapid convergence to a thermalized spectrum.
We conclude by making precise predictions for the spectra, the energy fluxes
and characteristic time-scales of the radiation for short-bursts. If the
precise luminosity variation and spectral hardening of the radiation we have
predicted will be confirmed by observations of short-bursts, these systems will
play a major role as standard candles in cosmology. These considerations will
also be relevant for the analysis of the long-bursts when the baryonic matter
contribution will be taken into account.

one of the largest ranges in X-ray luminosity (Lx ~ 10^43 - 10^45 erg/s), and
hence mass, of any sample studied at this redshift. We find that the `red'
galaxies form a tight color-magnitude relation (CMR) and that neither the slope
nor zero-point of this relation changes significantly over the factor of 100 in
X-ray luminosity of our sample. Using stellar population synthesis models we
find our data allow a maximum possible change of 2 Gyrs in the typical age of
the galaxies on the CMR over the range of Lx of our sample. We also measure the
fraction of blue galaxies (fb) relative to the CMR in our clusters and find a
low value of fb ~ 0.1 and find that there is no correlation between fb and Lx
over our large Lx range. However, both the CMR and fb do depend on cluster
radius, with the zero-point of the CMR shifting blueward in B-R by 0.10 +/-
0.036 magnitudes out to 0.75 times the virial radius, equivalent to a
luminosity weighted age gradient of ~ 2.5 Gyrs per log(radius). It thus appears
that the global cluster environment, in the form of cluster mass (Lx), has
little influence on the properties of bright cluster galaxies, whereas the
local environment, in the form of galaxy density (radius), has a strong effect.
The range of ~ 100 in Lx corresponds to a factor of ~ 40 in ram-pressure
efficiency, suggesting that ram-pressure stripping, or other mechanisms that
depend on cluster mass like tidal stripping or harassment, are unlikely to be
solely responsible for changing the galaxy population from the `blue' star
forming galaxies, that dominate low density environments, to the `red' passive
galaxies that dominate cluster cores.(abridged)

2001. The analysis reveals that the object was in the decline from an outburst
in 1992 and again in outburst in 2001. The historical light curve collected by
amateur astronomers shows low amplitude (1-2 mag) outbursts 5-10 days long,
recurrent every 80-90 days, confirming its dwarf nova nature. We derive an
outburst decline time scale of 1.2 days mag$^{-1}$. Eclipse mapping techniques
were applied to data both in quiescence and in outburst to derive accretion
disc surface brightness maps. A distance of $d = 170 \pm 30$ pc is obtained
from a method similar to that used to constrain the distance to open clusters.
  From this distance, disc radial brightness temperature distributions are
determined. The temperatures in the quiescent disc vary from $6 000$ K in the
inner regions to $3 000$ K near the outer disc and are flatter than the $T
\propto r^{-{3/4}}$ law for optically thick steady-state disc. The outburst
occurs mainly with a significant increase in brightness of the intermediate and
outer disc regions. The disc temperatures remain below the critical effective
temperature $T_{\rm crit}$ at all disc radii during outburst. The radial
temperature distributions in quiescence and in outburst are significantly
different from those of other dwarf novae of similar orbital period. These
results cannot be explained within the framework of the disc instability model.

bright background QSO, HS1700+643, these galaxies were pre-selected to lie at
z~2 based solely on their rest-frame UV colors and luminosities, and should be
representative of UV-selected samples at high redshift. In addition to deep
ground-based photometry spanning from 0.35-2.15 microns, we make use of
Spitzer/IRAC data, which probes the rest-frame near-IR at z~2. The range of
stellar populations present in the sample is investigated with simple,
single-component stellar population synthesis models. Emphasizing stellar mass
estimates, which are less subject to systematic uncertainties than other
parameters, we find <log(M*/Msun)>=10.32+/-0.51 for the sample. Allowing for
the possibility of episodic star formation, we find that typical galaxies in
our sample could contain up to three times more stellar mass in an old
underlying burst than what was inferred from single-component modeling. In
contrast, mass estimates for the most massive galaxies in the sample (M*>10^11
Msun) are fairly insensitive to the method used to model the stellar
population. Galaxies in this massive tail, which are also the oldest objects in
the sample, could plausibly evolve into the passive galaxies discovered at
z~1.7 with near-IR selection techniques. In the general framework of
hierarchical galaxy formation and mergers, which implies episodic
star-formation histories, galaxies at high redshift may pass in and out of
UV-selected and near-IR color-selected samples as they evolve from phases of
active star formation to quiescence and back again (Abridged).

X-ray detected LBGs at z~3, the majority of which are unlikely to have been
identified in blanket followup surveys of X-ray detected objects. We find the
comoving space density of moderate luminosity AGN at z=3 to be a factor ~10
higher than the most powerful objects. The available data are consistent with a
roughly constant space density of MLAGN from z=0.5-3, and they are also
consistent with a mild decline in the space density above z=1 as predicted by
the luminosity-dependent density evolution models of Ueda et al. (2003). This
strong AGN activity at z=3 argues against previous suggestions that the
majority of black hole accretion occurs at low redshift. A further implication
of our investigation is that, as far as can be determined from current data,
the majority of the AGN population at z~3 are selected by the LBG dropout
technique. Although this is sensitive to AGN with a UV-excess due to an
accretion disk, it predominantly identifies star-forming galaxies. A
significant fraction of X-ray sources seem likely to be hosted by these more
typical LBGs, further strengthening the starburst-AGN connection at high

which are irreversible but occur between two quasi-equilibrium stages.The
analysis allows the conclusion that the induced scale length is a real
confinement for the stellar system. The presence of this specific border on the
space of the baryonic luminous component has to be regarded as the physical
reason why a stellar galaxy belongs to the FP and why astrophysical objects,
with a completely different history and formation, but characterized by a tidal
radius (as the globular clusters are) lie on the same FP. An other problem
addressed is how this special configuration may be reached and why an
elliptical is not completely relaxed in respect to its dark halo.

This is an on-going project that aims to identify X-ray selected `normal'
galaxies (i.e. non-AGN dominated) in the local Universe. We are using a total
of 70 XMM-Newton fields covering an area of 11 sq. degrees which overlap with
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release-2. `Normal' galaxies are selected on
the basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low X-ray--to--optical
flux ratio (log(f_x/f_o)<-2) and soft X-ray colours. We find a total of 28
candidate `normal' galaxies to the 0.5-8 keV band flux limit of ~2x10^{-15}
cgs. Optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 per
cent). These provide additional evidence that our sources are bona-fide
'normal' galaxies with X-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emission
and/or X-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. Sixteen of our
galaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-type
SED. Combining our XMM-Newton sample with 18 local (z<0.22) galaxies from the
Chandra Deep Field North and South surveys, we construct the local X-ray
luminosity function of `normal' galaxies. This can be represented with a
Schechter form with a break at L* ~ 3x10^{41} cgs and a slope of ~1.78+/-0.12.
Using this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of the
form
  (1+z)^{3.3} we estimate a contribution to the X-ray background from `normal'
galaxies of 10-20 per cent (0.5-8 keV). Finally, we derive, for the first time,
the luminosity functions for early and late type systems separately.

the case in which the energy-momentum tensor of ordinary matter stays
individually conserved, we show from the holographic dark energy requirement
that the RG laws for the CC and G_N are completely determined in terms of the
lowest part of the particle spectrum of an underlying QFT. From simple
arguments one can then infer that the lowest-mass fields should have a Compton
wavelength comparable with the size of the current Hubble horizon. Hence,
although the models with the variable CC (or with both the CC and the G_N

follow the evolution of the ionization degree and the ionic composition as
functions of time and density. The processes of freeze--out on to the dust
grains and coagulation of the grains were treated simultaneously with the
chemical evolution of the medium.When proceeding at close to its maximum rate,
coagulation has important consequences for the degree of ionization and the
ionic composition of the medium, but its effect on the freeze--out of the
neutral species is modest.An innovation of our study is to calculate the grain
charge distribution which is significant because H+ ions recombine on the
surfaces of negatively charged grains. We also consider the observational
result that N-containing species, such as NH3 and N2H+,remain in the gas phase
at densities for which CO and other C--containing molecules appear to have
frozen on to grain surfaces. We conclude that recent measurements of the
adsorption energies of N2 and CO invalidate the interpretation of these
observations in terms of the relative volatilities of N2 and CO. We consider an
alternative explanation,in terms of low sticking coefficients for either
molecular or atomic N. We find that, irrespective of the nitrogen chemistry,the
main gas phase ion is either H+ or H3+ (and its deuterated isotopes) at
densities above 10^5; whether H+ or H3+ predominates depends sensitively on the
rate of increase in grain size (decrease in grain surface area per unit volume
of gas) during core contraction.Our calculations show that H+ will predominate
if grain coagulation proceeds at close to its maximum rate, and H3+ otherwise.

intercalation compounds (GIC) and, of these, the most easily fabricated is the

is well separated from the carbon sheets, also becomes occupied. We show that
the energy of the interlayer band is controlled by a combination of its
occupancy and the separation between the carbon layers.

transfer in these compounds is comparable to other superconducting graphite
intercalants such as C8K 1,2 . However, the superconducting transition
temperatures of C6Yb and C6Ca are up to two orders of magnitude greater.
Interestingly, superconducting upper critical field studies and resistivity

pure graphite. This is unexpected as the effect of introducing the intercalant

water and three well-known homologous disaccharides, namely trehalose, maltose
and sucrose, in aqueous solutions have been investigated in the 4-66 wt %
concentration range by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations.
Hydration numbers clearly show that trehalose binds to a larger number of water
molecules than do maltose or sucrose, thus affecting the water structure to a
deeper extent. Two-dimensional radial distribution functions of trehalose
definitely reveal that water is preferentially localized at the hydration sites
found in the dihydrate crystal, this tendency being enhanced when increasing
trehalose concentration. In a rather wide concentration range (4-49 wt %), the
fluctuations of the radius of gyration and of the glycosidic dihedral angles of
trehalose indicate a higher flexibility with respect to maltose and sucrose. At
sugar concentrations between 33 wt % and 66 wt %, the mean sugar cluster size
and the number of sugar-sugar hydrogen bonds (HBs) formed within sugar clusters
reveal that trehalose is able to form larger clusters than sucrose but smaller
than maltose. These features suggest that trehalose-water mixtures would be
more homogeneous than the two others, thus reducing both desiccation stresses
and ice formation.

collapse was increased by slower drying. It was considered that: 1) slower
drying resulted in higher sample temperature in the early stage of drying to
increase the collapse; 2) rapid drying stiffened the surface of sample and such
""shell"" prohibited the following collapse; 3) slower drying i.e. longer loading
of liquid tension caused more remarkable and/or frequent viscoelastic yields of
cells. Consequently the intensity of collapse increased when the cane was dried
from its waxy outer surface or in the presence of node: both of them retarded
the drying. On the other hand, higher drying temperature caused greater
intensity of collapse in spite of faster drying. It was suggested that the
thermal softening of cane cells leads to easier yield of the cell wall, at the
same time the rapid drying does not allow the recovery of collapse after the
disappearance of free water. These results indicated that faster drying at
lower temperature is preferable for drying cane with less collapse.

  Theory, March 2006",,,,"cs.IT cs.DM math.IT",,"  It is now well known that the performance of a linear code $C$ under
iterative decoding on a binary erasure channel (and other channels) is
determined by the size of the smallest stopping set in the Tanner graph for
$C$. Several recent papers refer to this parameter as the \emph{stopping
distance} $s$ of $C$. This is somewhat of a misnomer since the size of the
smallest stopping set in the Tanner graph for $C$ depends on the corresponding
choice of a parity-check matrix. It is easy to see that $s \le d$, where $d$ is
the minimum Hamming distance of $C$, and we show that it is always possible to
choose a parity-check matrix for $C$ (with sufficiently many dependent rows)
such that $s = d$. We thus introduce a new parameter, termed the \emph{stopping
redundancy} of $C$, defined as the minimum number of rows in a parity-check
matrix $H$ for $C$ such that the corresponding stopping distance $s(H)$ attains
its largest possible value, namely $s(H) = d$.
  We then derive general bounds on the stopping redundancy of linear codes. We
also examine several simple ways of constructing codes from other codes, and
study the effect of these constructions on the stopping redundancy.
Specifically, for the family of binary Reed-Muller codes (of all orders), we
prove that their stopping redundancy is at most a constant times their
conventional redundancy. We show that the stopping redundancies of the binary
and ternary extended Golay codes are at most 35 and 22, respectively. Finally,
we provide upper and lower bounds on the stopping redundancy of MDS codes.

exponential time with a linear number of alternations. The monotone fragment of
monad algebra with atomic value equality but without negation is complete for

establish TA[2^{O(n)}, O(n)] lower and exponential-space upper bounds.

all the features of a query language on complex values that are traditionally
deemed essential. A close connection between monad algebra on lists and Core
XQuery (with ``child'' as the only axis) is exhibited, and it is shown that
these languages are expressively equivalent up to representation issues. We
show that Core XQuery is just as hard as monad algebra w.r.t. combined

inferred luminosity distances are larger than naively expected, in accord with

attractive nature of the fermionic multiplet assignments is obviated by the
complicated multi-parameter Higgs potential apparently needed for
phenomenological reasons, and also by vacuum expectation value (VEV)
hierarchies within a given multiplet. This motivates the rigorous consideration
of Higgs potentials, symmetry breaking patterns and alternative symmetry
breaking mechanisms in models with this gauge group. Specifically, we study the
recently proposed ``clash of symmetries'' brane-world mechanism to see if it
can help with the symmetry breaking conundrum. This requires a detailed
analysis of Higgs potential global minima and kink or domain wall solutions
interpolating between the disconnected global minima created through
spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking. Sufficiently long-lived metastable
kinks can also be considered. We develop what we think is an interesting,

breaking cascade, trinification to left-right symmetry to the standard model to
colour cross electromagnetism, may be induced without an initial hierarchy in
vacuum expectation values. Another motivation for this paper is simply to

supersymmetric bound state composed of a slepton--antislepton pair at the next

approximation to estimate the threshold production cross-section of the $2P$
bound state. The parameter space of Gauge Mediated Symmetry Breaking (GMSB)
models allow a particular scenario in which a charged slepton
($\widetilde{e}_R, \widetilde{\mu}_R$ or $\widetilde{\tau}_1$) is the NLSP.
Within this scenario the produced $2P$ bound-state decays, through a dipole
transition, into the $1S$ ground-state with branching ratio $\approx 100% $
emitting a very soft ($\approx 1 $ MeV) photon which goes undetected. The
spectroscopy of the $1S$-state shows that it decays into two photons with $Br

production gives rise to the signal $e^+e^- \to 2P \to 1S + ""soft \gamma "" \to

($ e^+e^- \to \gamma \gamma$) has a statistical significance

multi--graph is drawn in the plane in the ``standard way'', what is the
distribution of its maximum size planar matching (set of non--crossing disjoint
edges) and maximum size planar subgraph (set of non--crossing edges which may
share endpoints)? The problem is a generalization of the Longest Increasing
Sequence (LIS) problem (also called Ulam's problem). We present combinatorial
identities which relate the number of $r$-regular bipartite multi--graphs with
maximum planar matching (maximum planar subgraph)of at most $d$ edges to a
signed sum of restricted lattice walks in $\ZZ^d$, and to the number of pairs
of standard Young tableaux of the same shape and with a ``descend--type''
property. Our results are obtained via generalizations of two combinatorial
proofs through which Gessel's identity can be obtained (an identity that is
crucial in the derivation of a bivariate generating function associated to the
distribution of LISs, and key to the analytic attack on Ulam's problem).

an extension of algebras within a bijective entwining structure over a

extension is defined and it is shown to be closely related to the Galois
property and to the equivariant projectivity of the extension. A generalisation
of the Doi theorem on total integrals in the framework of entwining structures
over a non-commutative ring is obtained, and the bearing of strong connections
on properties such as faithful flatness or relative injectivity is revealed. A
family of morphisms between the K0-group of the category of finitely generated
projective comodules of a coring and even relative cyclic homology groups of
the base algebra of an entwined extension with a strong connection is
constructed. This is termed a relative Chern-Galois character. Explicit
examples include the computation of a Chern-Galois character of depth 2
Frobenius split (or separable) extensions over a separable algebra R. Finitely
generated and projective modules are associated to an entwined extension with a

packets, and using an asymptotic multiple-scales expansion we obtain a suite of
evolution equations to describe energy exchange between the two components of
the system. Depending on the wave packet length-scale vis-a-vis the wave
amplitude scale, these evolution equations are either four non-dispersive and
nonlinearly coupled envelope equations, or four non-locally coupled nonlinear
Schroedinger equations. We also consider a set of fully coupled nonlinear
Schroedinger equations, even though this system contains small dispersive terms
which are strictly beyond the leading order of the asymptotic multiple-scales
expansion method. Using both the theoretical predictions following from these
asymptotic models and numerical simulations of the original unapproximated
equations, we investigate the stability of plane-wave solutions, and show that
they may be modulationally unstable. These instabilities can then lead to the
formation of localized structures, and to a modification of the energy exchange
between the components. When the system is close to being integrable, the
time-evolution is distinguished by a remarkable almost periodic sequence of
energy exchange scenarios, with spatial patterns alternating between
approximately uniform wavetrains and localized structures.

$p(\bar{p})$ from 200 GeV p+p and d+Au collisions are reported. This data were
taken in 2003 run from the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment. A
time-of-flight detector based on multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC)
technology is used for particle identification. The intrinsic timing resolution
85 ps was achieved after the calibration. We observe that the spectra of
$\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$ are considerably harder in d+Au than
those in p+p collisions. In $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$ GeV d+Au collisions, the
nuclear modification factor $R_{dAu}$ of protons rise faster than those of
pions and kaons. Besides, the particle-species dependence of the Cronin effect
is observed to be significantly smaller than that at lower energies. The ratio
of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{dAu}$) between $(p+\bar{p})$ and
charged hadrons ($h$) in the transverse momentum range $1.2<p_{T}<3.0$ GeV/c is
measured to be $1.19\pm0.05$(stat)$\pm0.03$(syst) in minimum-bias collisions
and shows little centrality dependence. The yield ratio of $(p+\bar{p})/h$ in
minimum-bias d+Au collisions is found to be a factor of 2 lower than that in
Au+Au collisions, indicating that the relative baryon enhancement observed in
heavy ion collisions at RHIC is due to the final state effects in Au+Au
collisions. The mechanism for Cronin effect is also discussed in this thesis by
comparison with the recombination model and with the initial multiple parton
scattering model. From the comparisons, we conclude that the Cronin effect in
200 GeV d+Au collisions is not initial state effect only, and that final state
effect plays an important role.

incompleteness and the intrinsic error of exchange-correlation functionals.

scenario requires that the universe be geometrically open and that biology is
structural in the sense that the current complexity of human society can be
reproduced by scaling up its (quantum mechanical) structure to arbitrary size.
If the recently measured ""cosmological constant"" is indeed a fundamental
constant of nature, then Dyson's scenario is, for various reasons, ruled out by
the finite (De Sitter) horizon due to exponential expansion of the resulting
space. However, the finite temperature of that horizon does open other
interesting options. If, as is suggested by the cosmology under consideration,
the current exponential expansion of the universe is due to a phase transition
which fixes a physical boundary condition during the early radiation dominated
era, the behavior of the universe after the relevant scale factor crosses the
De Sitter radius opens up still other possibilities. The relevance of Martin
Rees' apocalyptic eschatology recently presented in his book ""Our Final Hour""
is mentioned. It is concluded that even for the far future, whether or not
cultural and scientific descendants of the current epoch will play a role in
it, an understanding (sadly, currently lacking) of community and political
evolution and control is essential for a preliminary treatment of what could be
even vaguely called scientific eschatology.

meaningful because they represent different decay rates, but the classical

"physics/0503183","Andre Rousseau","Andr\'e Rousseau (OASU)","Is the San Andreas Fracture a bayonet-shaped fracture as inferred from
  the acoustic body waves in the SAFOD Pilot hole ?",,,,,"physics.geo-ph",,"  The method using the propagation of acoustic body waves within the stress
modified areas around a vertical borehole has been applied to the granitic
formation penetrated by the SAFOD Pilot hole near the San Andreas Fault trace.
This method allows us investigating the horizontal in situ stresses. Only P
waves supplied useful and surprising information. A depth of 1270 m separates
an upper region of uniform thickness of stress modified areas, possibly
corresponding to a shear domain, and a lower region where there are
simultaneously two values of the thicknesses of the stress modified areas
(particularly between 1500 and 1600 m of depth) possibly corresponding to a
compressive and a shear domain. In order to integrate the contradictory effects
of the simultaneity of shear and compressive domains at some depths, as well as
the presence of three shear zones at particular depths, we propose that the San
Andreas Fault could be bayonet-shaped instead of planar. Other recent available
information in the literature about this fault, such as the presence of a fault
zone of low shear wave velocity, stress rotation measured with depth, and the
large angles of the frictional coefficients, can be logically explained by this
kind of fault geometry.

networks to systems of isolated modules described by the Poisson statistics of
RMT. Our results indicate that although biological networks are very different
from other complex systems at the molecular level, they display the same
statistical properties at large scale. The transition point provides a new
objective approach for the identification of functional modules.

individual since results do not depend on the details of the dynamics, and, as
a consequence, the model is parameter free. The genealogical tree is very
complex, and distances between individuals (number of generations from the
common ancestor) are distributed according to probability density which remains
random in the thermodynamic limit (large population). We give a theoretical and
numerical description of this distribution and we also consider the dynamical
aspects of the problem describing the time evolution of the maximum and mean
distances in a single population.

quantity. Hermitian operators differing only by operator ordering of the
canonical coordinates and momenta at one moment of time are the most familiar
example. Classical spacetime alternatives that extend over time can also be
represented by different quantum operators. For example, operators representing
a particular value of the time average of a dynamical variable can be
constructed in two ways: First, as the projection onto the value of the time
averaged Heisenberg picture operator for the dynamical variable. Second, as the
class operator defined by a sum over those histories of the dynamical variable
that have the specified time-averaged value. We show both by explicit example
and general argument that the predictions of these different representations
agree in the classical limit and that sets of histories represented by them
decohere in that limit.

an injected electron scattering between them and by subsequent measurement of
the electron's state. We start by investigating an ideal case where only the
electronic spin interacts successively through the same unitary operation with
the spins of the two impurities. In this case, high (but not maximal)
entanglement can be generated with a significant success probability. We then
consider a more realistic description which includes both the forward and back
scattering amplitudes. In this scenario, we obtain the entanglement between the
impurities as a function of the interaction strength of the electron-impurity
coupling. We find that our scheme allows us to entangle the impurities
maximally with a significant probability.

decoherence time and time-delay between the write and read lasers and reproduce
