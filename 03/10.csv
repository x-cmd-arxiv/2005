the star formation history and remnant properties when various parametrizations
of a simple stellar feedback model are implemented. The simulations include
radiative cooling, a density-dependent star formation recipe and a model for
feedback from massive stars. The feedback model stores supernova feedback
energy within individual gas particles and dissipates this energy on a
time-scale specified by two free parameters; tau_fb, which sets the dissipative
time-scale, and n, which sets the effective equation of state in star-forming
regions. Using a self-consistent disc galaxy, modelled after a local Sbc
spiral, in both isolated and major-merger simulations, we investigate
parametrizations of the feedback model that are selected with respect to the
quiescent disc stability. These models produce a range of star formation
histories that are consistent with the star formation relation found by
Kennicutt. All major mergers produce a population of new stars that is highly
centrally concentrated, demonstrating a distinct break in the r1/4 surface
density profile, consistent with previous findings. The half-mass radius and
one-dimensional velocity dispersion are affected by the feedback model used.
Finally, we compare our results to those of previous simulations of star
formation in disc-galaxy major mergers, addressing the effects of star
formation normalization, the version of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
employed and assumptions about the interstellar medium.

measured X-ray flux can be attributed to inverse-Compton scattering of the
cosmic microwave background radiation, with magnetic field strengths in the
lobes between (0.3 - 1.3) B_eq, where the value B_eq corresponds to
equipartition between the electrons and magnetic field assuming a filling
factor of unity. There is a strong peak in the magnetic field strength
distribution at B ~ 0.7 B_eq. We find that > 70 percent of the radio lobes are
either at equipartition or electron dominated by a small factor. The
distribution of measured magnetic field strengths differs for narrow-line and
broad-line objects, in the sense that broad-line radio galaxies and quasars
appear to be further from equipartition; however, this is likely to be due to a
combination of projection effects and worse systematic uncertainty in the X-ray
analysis for those objects. Our results suggest that the lobes of classical
double radio sources do not contain an energetically dominant proton
population, because this would require the magnetic field energy density to be
similar to the electron energy density rather than the overall energy density

that changes in $\mu $ will be driven by the electronic energy density after
the electron mass threshold is crossed. Particle production in this scenario is
negligible. The cosmological constraints imposed by recent astronomical
observations are very weak, due to the low mass density in electrons. Unlike in
similar theories for spacetime variation of the fine structure constant, the
observational constraints on variations in $\mu $ imposed by the weak
equivalence principle are much more stringent constraints than those from
quasar spectra. Any time-variation in the electron-proton mass ratio must be
less than one part in $10^{9}$since redshifts $z\approx 1.$This is more than
one thousand times smaller than current spectroscopic sensitivities can
achieve. Astronomically observable variations in the electron-proton must
therefore arise directly from effects induced by varying fine structure
'constant' or by processes associated with internal proton structure. We also
place a new upper bound of $2\times 10^{-8}$ on any large-scale spatial

size of a template is determined by the ratio of (SNR-1)/SNR, and the maximum
detectable size is determined by the ratio of 1/SNR. Application of these
criteria is discussed in connection to data from filled-aperture instruments

of Fourier sampling, tapering, apodization and visibility weighting. Specific
resolution limits are derived for four different templates of brightness
distribution: (1) two-dimensional Gaussian, (2) optically thin spherical shell,
(3) disk of uniform brightness, and (4) ring. The limiting resolution for these
templates changes with SNR similarly to the quantum limit on resolution.
Practical application of the resolution limits is discussed in two examples
dealing with measurements of maximum brightness temperature in compact

existence of X-ray attenuation column densities,
$N_{H}>10^{24}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ is quite common amongst broad absorption line
quasars (BALQSOs). This is significant to the geometry of the broad absorption
line (BAL) outflow. In particular, such an X-ray shield also shields equatorial
accretion disk winds from the UV, thereby preventing high velocity equatorial
outflows from being launched. By contrast, bipolar winds initiated by continuum
radiation pressure from the funnel of a slim accretion disk flare outward (like
a trumpet) and offer vastly different absorbing columns to the X-ray and UV
emission which are emitted from distinct regions of the disk, $\sim 6M$ and
$\sim 10M-40M$, respectively (where $M$ is the radius of the black hole).
Recent numerical work indicates that it is also possible to launch bipolar
outflows from the inner regions of a thin disk. The recent discovery with VLBI
that the Galactic analog of a BALQSO, the X-ray binary Circinus X-1 (with high
velocity P Cygni X-ray absorption lines) is viewed virtually along the radio
jet axis (and therefore along the spin axis of the black hole and the normal to
the accretion disk) has rekindled interest in the bipolar models of BALQSOs. We
explore this possibility by studying the nearest BAL QSO, MRK 231. High

call the p-test which depends on both the value of $\chi_{min}^2$ and the
number $n$ of the parametrization parameters. The p-test measures the
confidence level to which the parameter values corresponding to LCDM are
excluded from the viewpoint of the parametrization tested. For example, for a
linear equation of state parametrization $w(z)=w_0 + w_1 z$ the LCDM parameter
values ($w_0=-1$, $w_1=0$) are excluded at 75% confidence level. We use a flat

the Gold dataset at their best fit. According to both statistical tests, the
worst fits among the 10 parametrizations, correspond to the Chaplygin gas, the
brane world and the Cardassian parametrizations. The best fit is achieved by
oscillating parametrizations which can exclude the parameter values
corresponding to LCDM at 85% confidence level. Even though this level of
significance does not provide a statistically significant exclusion of LCDM (it
is less than $2\sigma$) and does not by itself constitute conclusive evidence

scattering is likely to occur in the Klein-Nishina regime. Although the
Klein-Nishina effects are well known, the properties of the electron and

We solve the kinetic equation of electrons with the spatial escape term of the

observed emission spectrum. In calculations of the Compton losses in the
Klein-Nishina regime, we use the discrete loss formalism to take into account
the significant energy loss in a single scattering. Although the scattering
cross section decreases because of the Klein-Nishina effects, ample gamma rays
are emitted by inverse Compton scattering. When the injection spectrum of
electrons obeys a power law, the electron spectrum does not follow a broken
power law, as a result of the Klein-Nishina effects, and a large number of

number density of the old stars revealed two stellar substructures in these
galaxies: thick disk and halo. The borders of these substructures consisting
mainly of red giants, are determined by the change of number density gradient
of the old stars. The revealed halos have flattened shapes and extend up to 25
kpc from the galaxy planes. The obtained results of number density
distributions of different type stars perpendicular to the galaxy planes allow
us to verify our stellar model of spiral galaxies. Using the determination of
the tip of red giant branch (TRGB method) we have derived the following
distances: D = 9.82 Mpc (NGC 891), D = 7.24 Mpc (NGC 4144), D = 4.29 Mpc (NGC
4244).

due to two distinct reasons, the
  Alcock-Paczynski effect and the peculiar velocities, both of which are
sensitive to the cosmological parameters. The signal is also expected to be
sensitive to the details of the HI distribution at the epoch when the radiation
originated. We use simple models for the HI distribution at the epoch of
reionizaation and the post-reionization era to investigate exactly what we hope
to learn from future observations of the anisotropy pattern in HI maps. We find
that such observations will probably tell us more about the HI distribution
than about the background cosmological model. Assuming that reionization can be
described by spherical, ionized bubbles all of the same size with their centers
possibly being biased with respect to the dark matter, we find that the
anisotropy pattern at small angles is expected to have a bump at the
characteristic angular size of the individual bubbles whereas the large scale
anisotropy pattern will reflect the size and the bias of the bubbles. The
anisotropy also depends on the background cosmological parameters, but the
dependence is much weaker. Under the assumption that the HI in the
post-reionization era traces the dark matter with a possible bias, we find that
changing the bias and changing the background cosmology has similar effects on
the anisotropy pattern. Combining observations of the anisotropy with
independent estimates of the bias, possibly from the bi-spectrum, may allow
these observations to constrain cosmological parameters.

constant at late times,the cosmological parameters required to fit the CMB data
are: \Omega_x = 0.43 \pm 0.12, baryon fraction \Omega_b = 0.08 \pm 0.01, slope
of the matter power spectrum at large scals n_s = 0.98 \pm 0.02 and Hubble
constant H_0 = 56 \pm 4 km/s/Mpc. The data prefers a dark energy component with
a dimensionless decay parameter c^2 =0.005 and non-interacting models are
consistent with the data only at the 99% confidence level. Using the Bayesian
Information Criteria we show that this exra parameter fits the data better than
models with no interaction. The quintessence equation of state parameter is
less constrained; i.e., the data set an upper limit w_x \leq -0.86 at the same
level of significance. When the WMAP anisotropy data are combined with
supernovae data, the density parameter of dark energy increases to \Omega_x
\simeq 0.68 while c^2 augments to 6.3 \times 10^{-3}. Models with quintessence
decaying into dark matter provide a clean explanation for the coincidence

geometrically thin, spherical shells found around some carbon stars has been an
enigma for some time. Based on extensive radiative transfer modelling of both
CO line emission and dust continuum radiation for all objects with known
detached molecular shells, we present compelling evidence that these shells
show clear signs of interaction with a surrounding medium. The derived masses
of the shells increase with radial distance from the central star while their
velocities decrease. A simple model for interacting winds indicate that the
mass-loss rate producing the faster moving wind has to be almost two orders of
magnitudes higher (~10^-5 solar masses per year) than the slower AGB wind (a
few 10^-7 solar masses per year) preceding this violent event. At the same
time, the present-day mass-loss rates are very low indicating that the epoch of
high mass-loss rate was relatively short, on the order of a few hundred years.
This, together with the number of sources exhibiting this phenomenon, suggests
a connection with He-shell flashes (thermal pulses). We report the detection of
a detached molecular shell around the carbon star DR Ser, as revealed from new
single-dish CO (sub-)millimetre line observations. The properties of the shell
are similar to those characterising the young shell around U Cam.

conduction electrons is fully taken into account. When the Fermi energy of the
electrons is larger than the exchange energy ($E_{\rm F}>J_{\rm sd}$), the spin
precession induces spin wave excitations in the local spins which contribute
towards the displacement of the domain wall. The resulting average velocity is
found to be much smaller than the one obtained in the adiabatic limit. For
$E_{\rm F}<J_{\rm sd}$, the results are consistent with the adiabatic

structure phase transitions in BaTiO3. Powder X-ray diffraction result
indicated that the samples were in very slightly distorted rhombohedral
structure at room temperature, and the dielectric measurement showed only
cubic-to-rhombohedral phase transition occurred. Instead of a sharp peak
characteristic of a ferroelectric (FE) transition, the large dielectric
response was similar to those in nonferroelectric perovskites CaCu3Ti4O12,
AFe1/2B1/2O3 (A=Ba, Sr, Ca; B=Nb, Ta, Sb) and IBLC (Internal Barrier Layer
Capacitance) BaTiO3 based FE ceramics. However, unlike its FE analogue, the
conventional BaTiO3 based IBLC ceramics, our samples showed weaker temperature
dependence of relative permittivity which spans over a wide temperature range.
A Maxwell-Wagner type relaxation in the FE state was observed. Moreover,
another relaxation mode appears from the vicinity of FE phase transition
temperature TC, and extends over a narrow temperature range, with unusual
slowing down of relaxation rate as temperature rises, which is contrary to what
is commonly observed. We associate these unusual phenomena with the very
slightly distorted rhombohedral structure of our samples and the presence of
the grain boundary barrier layer where oxygen vacancies distribute
non-homogeneously.

scale information systems. In this context application servers often form the
bottleneck for a system's efficiency. An application server exposes an object
oriented interface consisting of set of methods which are accessed by
potentially remote clients. The idea of method caching is to store results of
read-only method invocations with respect to the application server's interface
on the client side. If the client invokes the same method with the same
arguments again, the corresponding result can be taken from the cache without
contacting the server. It has been shown that this approach can considerably
improve a real world system's efficiency.
  This paper extends the concept of method caching by addressing the case where
clients wrap related method invocations in ACID transactions. Demarcating
sequences of method calls in this way is supported by many important
application server standards. In this context the paper presents an
architecture, a theory and an efficient protocol for maintaining full
transactional consistency and in particular serializability when using a method
cache on the client side. In order to create a protocol for scheduling cached
method results, the paper extends a classical transaction formalism. Based on
this extension, a recovery protocol and an optimistic serializability protocol
are derived. The latter one differs from traditional transactional cache
protocols in many essential ways. An efficiency experiment validates the
approach: Using the cache a system's performance and scalability are
considerably improved.

an isotropic and homogeneous, spatially flat model, the corresponding solutions
retain the well established features of the standard cosmology, and, in
addition, are in accordance with the observed cosmological parameters. Our
scenario presents an initial phase dominated by radiation, followed by a dust
era long enough to permit structure formation, and by an epoch dominated by the
cosmological term, which tends asymptotically to a de Sitter universe. Taking
the matter density equals to half of the vacuum energy density, as suggested by
observation, we obtain a universe age given by Ht = 1.1, and a decelerating

concentrating on the Alternate Left-Right and Inert models. We show that the
R-parity conserving scenario always exhibits a large Dirac mass for \nu_L with
maximal mixing with an isosinglet neutrino, and that R-parity violating
scenarios do not change the picture other than allowing further mixing with
another isosinglet. In order to recover Standard Model phenomenology,
additional assumptions in the form of discrete symmetries and/or new
interactions are needed. We introduce and investigate Discrete Symmetry method
and Higher Dimensional Operators as mechanisms for solving the neutrino mass
and mixing problems in these models.

Thus when the time of observation T is so brief that T \leq 2 \theta w, where w

It approaches the commutative pattern only when \frac{\theta w}{T} goes to 0.

equation, when the zero-order term is a multiple-front solution: (i) The

(equation obeyed by the zero-order approximation) is not asymptotically

allows a simple modification of the expansion procedure, making it possible to
overcome both problems in more than one way. The loss of asymptotic
integrability is shifted from the Normal Form to the higher-order terms (part
of which has to be computed numerically) in the expansion of the solution. The

diffusion in a reversible and conservative system. Balancing of pressure and

Fourier component separately. The measured surface spectra at onset are in good
agreement with the predictions from a linear stability analysis. For the
nonlinear state our measurements show in a direct manner how energy is
transferred from lower to higher harmonics and we quantify the nonlinear
coupling coefficients. Furthermore we find that the nonlinear coupling
generates constant components in the spatial Fourier spectrum leading to a
contribution of a non oscillating permanent sinusoidal deformed surface state.

Intermediate Mass Fragments (IMF) production takes place. The decay of a
quasi-projectile has been identified; its excitation energy leads to a
multifragmentation totally described in terms of a statistical disassembly of a
thermalized system (T$\simeq$4 MeV, E$^*\simeq$4 MeV/nucleon). Moreover, for
the systems Ni+Ni, Ni+Ag, in the same nuclear reaction, a source with velocity
intermediate between that of the quasi-projectile and that of the quasi-target,
emitting IMF, is observed. The fragments produced by this source are more
neutron rich than the average matter of the overall system, and have a charge
distribution different, with respect to those statistically emitted from the
quasi-projectile. The above features can be considered as a signature of the
dynamical origin of the midvelocity emission. The results of this analysis show
that IMF can be produced via different mechanisms simultaneously present within
the same collision. Moreover, once fixed the characteristics of the
quasi-projectile in the three considered reactions (in size, excitation energy
and temperature), one observes that the probability of a partner IMF production
via dynamical mechanism has a threshold (not present in the Ni+Al case) and
increases with the size of the target nucleus.

quark-gluon plasma (QGP) fluid created in a heavy-ion collision. In jet
quenching, a hard QCD parton, before fragmenting into a jet of hadrons,
deposits a fraction of its energy in the medium, leading to suppressed
production of high-pT hadrons. Assuming that the deposited energy quickly
thermalizes, we simulate the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP
fluid. For partons moving at supersonic speed, v_p > c_s, and sufficiently
large energy loss, a shock wave forms leading to conical flow [1]. The PHENIX
Collaboration recently suggested that observed structures in the azimuthal
angle distribution [2] might be caused by conical flow. We show here that
conical flow produces different angular structures than predicted in [1] and
that, for phenomenologically acceptable values of parton energy loss, conical
flow effects are too weak to explain the structures seen by PHENIX [2].

appropriate non-homogeneous Maxwell equation to both operations, we have
revealed an additional symmetric term in the tensor, named as ""compensating

method of ""gauge renormalization, which allows transforming the divergent terms

been shown that the energy flux in a free electromagnetic field is guided by
the Poynting vector, whereas the energy flux in a bound EM field is described
by the generalized Umov vector, defined in the paper. The problem of ""Poincare

log algorithms, proceed by reduction to a Hidden Subgroup problem, in which an
unknown subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a uniform superposition
on a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are typically solved by
Fourier sampling. When G is nonabelian, two important variants of Fourier
sampling have been identified: the weak standard method, where only
representation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full
measurement (i.e., the row and column of the representation, in a suitably
chosen basis) occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method
is indeed stronger. In this article, we settle this question in the
affirmative. We show that hidden subgroups H of the q-hedral groups, i.e.,
semidirect products Z_q \ltimes Z_p where q | (p-1), and in particular the
affine groups A_p, can be information-theoretically reconstructed using the
strong standard method. Moreover, if |H| = p/ \polylog(p), these subgroups can
be fully reconstructed with a polynomial amount of quantum and classical
computation. We show that, for some q, neither the ``forgetful'' abelian method
nor measuring in a random basis succeeds, even information-theoretically. Thus,
at least for some groups, it is crucial to use the full power of representation
theory: namely, to measure the high-dimensional representations in an adapted
basis that respects the group's subgroup structure. We apply our algorithm for
the hidden subgroup problem to new families of cryptographically motivated
Hidden Shift problems, generalizing work of van Dam, Hallgren and Ip on shifts
of multiplicative characters.

number of qubits by nuclear magnetic resonance. An important subroutine in any
computing is the readout of the output. ``Spectral implementation'' originally
suggested by Z.L. Madi, R. Bruschweiler and R.R. Ernst,
  [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 10603 (1999)], provides an elegant method of readout
with the use of an extra `observer' qubit. At the end of computation, detection
of the observer qubit provides the output via the multiplet structure of its
spectrum. In ""spectral implementation"" by two-dimensional experiment the
observer qubit retains the memory of input state during computation, thereby
providing correlated information on input and output, in the same spectrum.
""Spectral implementation"" of Grover's search algorithm, approximate quantum
counting, a modified version of Berstein-Vazirani problem, and Hogg's algorithm
is demonstrated here in three and four-qubit systems.

postulated quantum mechanical approach for calculating the arrival time
distribution. This is specifically illustrated by using the modulus of the
probability current density for calculating the arrival time distribution of
spin-1/2 neutral particles at the exit point of a spin-rotator(SR) which
contains a constant magnetic field. Such a calculated time distribution is then
used for evaluating the distribution of spin orientations along different
directions for these particles emerging from the SR. Based on this, the result
of spin measurement along any arbitrary direction for such an ensemble is
predicted.

respectively. Nonlocality of twin beam has been investigated, as well as that
of its non-Gaussian counterparts obtained by inconclusive subtraction of
photons. Our results indicate that: i) nonlocality of twin beam is degraded but
not destroyed by noise; ii) photon subtraction enhances nonlocality in the
presence of noise, especially in the low-energy regime.

two plane plates obtained using a micromachined torsional oscillator. The main
improvements in the current experiment are a significant suppression of the
surface roughness of the Au layers deposited on the interacting surfaces, and a
decrease in the experimental error in the measurement of the absolute
separation. A metrological analysis of all data permitted us to determine both
the random and systematic errors, and to find the total experimental error as a
function of separation at the 95% confidence level. In contrast to all previous
experiments on the Casimir effect, our smallest experimental error ($\sim
0.5$%) is achieved over a wide separation range. The theoretical Casimir
pressures in the experimental configuration were calculated by the use of four
theoretical approaches suggested in the literature. All corrections to the
Casimir force were calculated or estimated. All theoretical errors were
analyzed and combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the 95%
confidence level. Finally, the confidence interval for the differences between
theoretical and experimental pressures was obtained as a function of
separation. Our measurements are found to be consistent with two theoretical
approaches utilizing the plasma model and the surface impedance over the entire
measurement region. Two other approaches to the thermal Casimir force,
utilizing the Drude model or a special prescription for the determination of
the zero-frequency contribution to the Lifshitz formula, are excluded on the
basis of our measurements at the 99% and 95% confidence levels, respectively.
Finally, constraints on Yukawa-type hypothetical interactions are strengthened
by up to a factor of 20 in a wide interaction range.
