alter the recombination history of the Universe, and affect the observed CMB
temperature and polarization fluctuations. Unlike other astrophysical probes of
DM, this is free of the significant uncertainties in modelling galactic
physics, and provides a method to detect and constrain the cosmological
abundances of these particles. We parametrize the effect of DM annihilation as
an injection of ionizing energy at a rate e_{dm}, and argue that this simple
""on the spot'' modification is a good approximation to the complicated
interaction of the annihilation products with the photon-electron plasma.
Generic models of DM do not change the redshift of recombination, but change
the residual ionization after recombination. This broadens the surface of last
scattering, suppressing the temperature fluctuations and enhancing the
polarization fluctuations. We use the temperature and polarization angular
power spectra to measure these deviations from the standard recombination
history, and therefore, indirectly probe DM annihilation. (abridged)

important primary nitrogen production in very metal-poor massive stars. Here,
we compute a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way aimed at
explaining these new abundance data. The new data can be explained by adopting:
a) the stellar yields obtained from stellar models that take into account
rotation and b) an extra production of nitrogen in the very metal-poor massive
stars. In particular, we suggest an increase of nearly a factor of 200 in 14N
for a star of 60 Msun and 40 for a star of 9Msun, for metallicities below
Z=10$^{-5}$, with respect to the yields given in the literature for Z=10$^{-5}$
and rotational velocity of 300 km/s. We show that once we adopt the above
prescriptions, our model is able to predict high N/O abundance ratios at low
metallicities and still explains the nitrogen abundances observed in thin disk
stars in the solar vicinity. The physical motivation for a larger nitrogen
production in massive stars in very metal-poor environments could be the fact
that some stellar models as well as observational data suggest that at low
metallicities stars rotate faster. If this is the case, such large nitrogen
production seen in the pristine phases of the halo formation would not
necessarily happen in Damped Lyman-alpha systems which have metallicities
always above [Fe/H]$\simeq -$2.5, and could have been pre-enriched. We also
compute the abundance gradient of N/O along the Galactic disk and show that a
negative gradient is predicted once we adopt stellar yields where rotation is
taken into account. The latter result implies that intermediate mass stars
contribute less to the primary nitrogen than previously thought.

code has been applied to two-dimensional simulations of carbon monoxide (CO) in
the non-magnetic solar photosphere and low chromosphere. For this purpose a
reaction network has been constructed, taking into account the reactions which
are most important for the formation and dissociation of CO under the physical
conditions of the solar atmosphere. The network has been strongly reduced to 27
reactions, involving the chemical species H, H2, C, O, CO, CH, OH, and a
representative metal. The resulting CO number density is highest in the cool
regions of the reversed granulation pattern at mid-photospheric heights and
decreases strongly above. There, the CO abundance stays close to a value of 8.3
on the usual logarithmic abundance scale with [H]=12 but is reduced in hot
shock waves which are a ubiquitous phenomenon of the model atmosphere. For
comparison, the corresponding equilibrium densities have been calculated, based
on the reaction network but also under assumption of instantaneous chemical
equilibrium by applying the Rybicki & Hummer (RH) code by Uitenbroek (2001).
Owing to the short chemical timescales, the assumption holds for a large
fraction of the atmosphere, in particular the photosphere. In contrast, the CO
number density deviates strongly from the corresponding equilibrium value in
the vicinity of chromospheric shock waves. Simulations with altered reaction
network clearly show that the formation channel via hydroxide (OH) is the most
important one under the conditions of the solar atmosphere.

is favoured over pure density. The local X-ray luminosity density is also well
defined. We discuss different estimates of the galaxies LogN-LogS, selected
from the Chandra Deep Fields with different selection criteria: these have
similar slopes, but normalisations scattered within a factor ~2, of the same
order of the Poissonian error on the counts. We compare the observed LogN-LogS
with the counts predicted by integrating our reference z=0 XLF. By using number
counts alone, it is not possible to discriminate between density and luminosity
evolution; however, the evolution of galaxies must be stopped in both cases at
z~1-2. The contribution of galaxies to the X-ray background is found to be in
the range 6%--12%. Making use of cosmic star formation models, we find that the
X-ray LogN-LogS might be not compatible with very large star formation rates at
z ~ 3 as suggested by sub-mm observations in Blain et al. 1999. As to the

The cosmic superstrings produced in a D3-brane-antibrane inflationary scenario
have a spectrum: $(p,q)$ bound states of $p$ fundamental (F) strings and $q$
D-strings, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime. By extending the velocity-dependent
one-scale network evolution equations for abelian Higgs cosmic strings to allow
a spectrum of string tensions, we construct a coupled (infinite) set of
equations for strings that interact through binding and self-interactions. We
apply this model to a network of $(p,q)$ superstrings. Our numerical solutions
show that $(p,q)$ networks rapidly approach a stable scaling solution. We also
extract the relative densities of each string type from our solutions.
Typically, only a small number of the lowest tension states are populated
substantially once scaling is reached. The model we study also has an
interesting new feature: the energy released in $(p,q)$ string binding is by
itself adequate to allow the network to reach scaling. This result suggests
that the scaling solution is robust. To demonstrate that this result is not
trivial, we show that choosing a different form for string interactions can
lead to network frustration.

constrain theoretical models of dust processing in these systems: i) none of
the sources consists of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in the
interstellar medium, ii) all sources with a high fraction of crystalline
silicates are dominated by large grains, iii) the disks around more massive
stars (M >~ 2.5 M_sun, L >~ 60 L_sun) have a higher fraction of crystalline
silicates than those around lower mass stars, iv) in the subset of lower mass

the derived crystallinity of the dust. The correlation between the shape and
strength of the 10 micron silicate feature reported by van Boekel et al. (2003)

combined with that of other studies to present a likely scenario of dust
processing in Herbig Ae systems. We conclude that the present data favour a
scenario in which the crystalline silicates are produced in the innermost
regions of the disk, close to the star, and transported outward to the regions
where they can be detected by means of 10 micron spectroscopy. Additionally, we
conclude that the final crystallinity of these disks is reached very soon after

continue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic
shocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the
origin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. Only one
concurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated with
emission from an external shock. Here we report the discovery of infrared (IR)
emission contemporaneous with a GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of
GRB 041219a. Our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phase
of the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of any

Antenna (LISA). The number of inspiral, merger and ringdown events above a
signal to noise ratio of 5 that result from massive black hole seeds is of
order 10^3. This prediction is robust and insensitive to several of the details

effectively rule out or confirm a class of models where supermassive black
holes grow from high-mass seed black holes and may be able to place strong
limits on the role of mergers as a channel for supermassive black hole growth.
Supermassive black hole seeds likely form in the earliest proto-galactic

matter distribution. By means of a semi-analytic model we demonstrate that the
interplay between gravitation, dynamical friction and tidal mass loss and
destruction can explain the observed number density profile. We use only two
parameters in our models: the total to stellar mass fraction of the satellite
halos and the disruption efficiency. The disruption efficiency is expressed by
a minimum radius. If the tidal radius of the galaxy (halo) falls below this
radius the galaxies is assumed to become unobservable. The preferred parameters
are an initial total to stellar mass fraction of ~20 and a disruption radius of
4 kpc. In that model about 20% of all the satellites are totally disrupted on
their orbits within the group environment. Dynamical friction is less important
in shaping the inner slope of the number density profile since the reduction in
mass by tidal forces lowers the impact of the friction term. The main
destruction mechanism is tide. In the preferred model the total B-band
luminosity of all the disrupted galaxies is about twice the observed luminosity

additionally to treat the lateral momentum and transport of diffuse
line-radiation, initially here within a 2D context. A key incentive is to study
the damping effect of the associated diffuse line-drag on the dynamical
properties of the flow, focusing particularly on whether this might prevent
lateral break-up of shell structures at scales near the lateral Sobolev angle
of ca. $1^{\rm o}$. We first explore nonlinear simulations that cast the
lateral diffuse force in the simple, local form of a parallel viscosity.
Second, to account for the lateral mixing of radiation associated with the
radial driving, we next explore models in which the radial force is azimuthally
smoothed over a chosen scale. Third, to account for both the lateral line-drag
and the lateral mixing in a more self-consistent way, we explore further a
method first proposed by Owocki (1999), which uses a restricted 3-ray approach
that combines a radial ray with two oblique rays set to have an impact

Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., Buneman, Weibel and
other two-stream instabilities) created in collisionless shocks are responsible
for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using a 3-D
relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating into
an ambient plasma. We find that the growth times of the Weibel instability in
electron-positron jets are not affected by the (electron-positron or
electron-ion) ambient plasmas. However, the amplitudes of generated local
magnetic fields in the electron-ion ambient plasma are significantly larger
than those in the electron-positron ambient plasma.

sub-giant and red giant stars. Our study concerns the temporal evolution of the
habitable zone. The distance between the star and the habitable zone, as well
as its width, increases with time as a consequence of stellar evolution. The
habitable zone moves outward after the star leaves the main sequence, sweeping
a wider range of distances from the star until the star reaches the tip of the
asymptotic giant branch. If life could form and evolve over time intervals from
$5 \times 10^8$ to $10^9$ years, then there could be habitable planets with
life around red giant stars. For a 1 M$_{\odot}$ star at the first stages of
its post main-sequence evolution, the temporal transit of the habitable zone is
estimated to be of several 10$^9$ years at 2 AU and around 10$^8$ years at 9
AU. Under these circumstances life could develop at distances in the range 2-9
AU in the environment of sub-giant or giant stars and in the far distant future
in the environment of our own Solar System. After a star completes its first
ascent along the Red Giant Branch and the He flash takes place, there is an
additional stable period of quiescent He core burning during which there is
another opportunity for life to develop. For a 1 M$_{\odot}$ star there is an
additional $10^9$ years with a stable habitable zone in the region from 7 to 22
AU. Space astronomy missions, such as proposed for the Terrestrial Planet
Finder (TPF) and Darwin should also consider the environments of sub-giants and
red giant stars as potentially interesting sites for understanding the
development of life.

network and contribute to its dynamics and heating. We model the network as
consisting of individual flux tubes with a non-potential field structure that
are located in intergranular lanes. With a typical horizontal size of 200 km at
the base of the photosphere, they expand upward and merge with their neighbors
at a height of about 600 km. Above a height of approximately 1000 km the
magnetic field starts to become uniform.
  Waves are generated in this medium by means of motions at the lower boundary.
We focus on transverse driving, which generates both fast and slow waves within
a flux tube and acoustic waves at the interface of the tube and the field-free
medium. The acoustic waves at the interface are due to compression of the gas
on one side of the flux tube and expansion on the other. These waves travel
upward along the two sides of the (2D) flux tube and enter it, where they
become longitudinal waves. For impulsive excitation with a time constant of 120
s, we find that a dominant feature is the creation of vortical motions that
propagate upward. We have identified an efficient mechanism for the generation
of longitudinal waves and shock formation in the chromospheric part of the flux
concentration. We examine some broad implications of our results.

The simultaneous spectrum shows a spectral break at about 3.6 cm, a possible
signature of synchrotron self-absorption of the strong radio outburst which

$0.22\pm0.06$ Jy, suggesting a sharp decrease in flux density at wavelengths

stars contributing to the luminosity flux collected by a single pixel. A star
must be sufficiently magnified, that is, the lens impact parameter must be less
than a threshold value $u_T$ if the excess photon flux in a pixel is to be
detected over the background. Assuming the parameters of the Isaac Newton
Telescope and typical observing conditions, we present maps in the sky plane
towards M31 of threshold impact parameter, optical depth, event number and
event time scale, analyzing in particular how these quantities depend on $u_T$
in pixel lensing searches. We use an analytical approach consisting of
averaging on $u_T$ and the star column density the optical depth, microlensing
rate and event duration time scale. An overall decrease in the expected optical
depth and event number with respect to the classical microlensing results is
found, particularly towards the high luminosity M31 inner regions. As expected,
pixel lensing events towards the inner region of M31 are mostly due to
self-lensing, while in the outer region dark events dominate even for a 20%
MACHO halo fraction. We also find a far-disk/near-disk asymmetry in the
expected event number, smaller than that found by \cite{Kerins04}. Both for
self and dark lensing events, the pixel lensing time scale we obtain is $\simeq
1 - 7$ days, dark events lasting roughly twice as long as self-lensing events.
The shortest events are found to occur towards the M31 South Semisphere. We
also note that the pixel lensing results depend on $<u_T>$ and $<u_T^{~2}>$

radiation measurements impose that the baryonic content of the Universe cannot
exceed the 4% of the critical density, so the nature of the remaining 23% has
yet to be identi ed. In this sense, one of the most promising candidates is
represented by supersymmetric neutralinos. If they exist, they give rise to
relic densities in the required range, and are very well motivated in the
framework of theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.
In addition to direct neutralino searches and collider experiments, neutralino
annihilation into gamma rays, neutrinos and synchrotron emission from the
charged products represents a reliable way of detecting these intriguing
particles. The strongest signals are expected to come from the Galactic Center
and from the nearest dwarf spheroidals. Clumps of dark matter in galactic
haloes are well predicted by high resolution cold dark matter numerical
simulations. In this work we present our studies on the gamma-ray emission from
the Galactic Center and from the Draco dwarf spheroidal. We investigate the e

\~1.6 Gyr and rotation periods between ~1d and 12.4d have been observed. We
derive coronal element abundances and the coronal emission measure distribution
(EMD). The abundances change from an inverse-First Ionization Potential (FIP)
distribution in stars with ages around 0.1 Gyr to a solar-type FIP distribution
in stars at ages of 0.3 Gyr and beyond. The coronal EMDs show shapes
characterized by power-laws on each side of the EMD peak. The latter shifts
from temperatures of about 10 MK in the most rapidly rotating, young stars to
temperatures around 4 MK in the oldest target considered here. The power-law
index on the cooler side of the EMD exceeds expected slopes for static loops,
with typical values being 1.5-3. We interpret this slope with a model in which
the coronal emission is due to a superposition of stochastically occurring
flares, with an occurrence rate that is distributed in radiated energy E as a
power-law, dN/dE ~ E^-a. Our EMDs indicate a ~ 2.2-2.8, in excellent agreement
with values previously derived from light curves of magnetically active stars.
We derive the range of flare energies required to explain the light-curve
modulation. In an overall scenario, we propose that flaring activity plays a
larger role in more active stars. In this model, the higher flare rate is
responsible both for the higher average coronal temperature and the high
coronal X-ray luminosity, two parameters that are indeed found to be
correlated.

asymmetric summation method which solves this problem and dramatically improves
the numerical convergence. This new technique should make the implementation of
the theory and its possible future extensions feasible for a wide range of

find numerous applications, ranging from quantum optics to nuclear and

alignment of adatoms attached to the walls of carbon nanotubes. A general
expression for the indirect coupling in terms of single-particle Green
functions is presented. Contrary to the general property that magnetic moments
embedded in a metal display Friedel-like oscillations in their magnetic

show monotonic behaviour as a function of the adatom separation. Rather than an
intrinsic property, the monotonicity is shown to reflect a commensurability
effect in which the coupling oscillates with periods that coincide with the

of view of nonlinear dynamics within the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formulation.
The following results are obtained. 1) We clarify that the so-called
Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) limit becomes exact when damping constant is infinitely
large. Under the limit, the magnetization moves along the steepest energy
descent path. The minimal switching field is the one at which there is only one
stable fixed point in the system. 2) For a given magnetic anisotropy, there is
a critical value for the damping constant, above which the minimal switching
field is the same as that of the SW-limit. 3) We illustrate how fixed points
and their basins change under a field along different directions. This change
explains well why a non-parallel field gives a smaller minimal switching field
and a short switching time. 4) The field of a ballistic magnetization reversal
should be along certain direction window in the presence of energy dissipation.
The width of the window depends on both of the damping constant and the
magnetic anisotropy. The upper and lower bounds of the direction window
increase with the damping constant. The window width oscillates with the
damping constant for a given magnetic anisotropy. It is zero for both zero and
infinite damping. Thus, the perpendicular field configuration widely employed
in the current experiments is not the best one since the damping constant in a
real system is far from zero.

particularized to the matched filter, decorrelator, linear MMSE detector, the

conditioned on the transmitted symbol, converges as the number of users go to
infinity to a deterministic function of a ""hidden"" Gaussian statistic
independent of the interferers. Thus the multiuser channel can be decoupled:
Each user experiences an equivalent single-user Gaussian channel, whose
signal-to-noise ratio suffers a degradation due to the multiple-access
interference. The uncoded error performance (e.g., symbol-error-rate) and the
mutual information can then be fully characterized using the degradation
factor, also known as the multiuser efficiency, which can be obtained by
solving a pair of coupled fixed-point equations identified in this paper. Based

renormalizability, since these approximations involve selective summations to
infinite perturbative orders. In this paper we show how to renormalize all
$n$-point functions of the theory, which are given by derivatives of the
2PI-resummed effective action $\Gamma[\phi]$ for scalar fields $\phi$. This
provides a complete description in terms of the generating functional for
renormalized proper vertices, which extends previous prescriptions in the
literature on the renormalization for 2PI effective actions. The importance of
the 2PI-resummed generating functional for proper vertices stems from the fact
that the latter respect all symmetry properties of the theory and, in
particular, Goldstone's theorem in the phase with spontaneous symmetry
breaking. This is important in view of the application of these techniques to
gauge theories, where Ward identities play a crucial role.

  optimality",,,,,"math.PR cs.CC math.CO",,"  In this paper we study functions with low influences on product probability
spaces. The analysis of boolean functions with low influences has become a
central problem in discrete Fourier analysis. It is motivated by fundamental
questions arising from the construction of probabilistically checkable proofs
in theoretical computer science and from problems in the theory of social
choice in economics.
  We prove an invariance principle for multilinear polynomials with low
influences and bounded degree; it shows that under mild conditions the
distribution of such polynomials is essentially invariant for all product
spaces. Ours is one of the very few known non-linear invariance principles. It
has the advantage that its proof is simple and that the error bounds are
explicit. We also show that the assumption of bounded degree can be eliminated
if the polynomials are slightly ``smoothed''; this extension is essential for
our applications to ``noise stability''-type problems.
  In particular, as applications of the invariance principle we prove two
conjectures: the ``Majority Is Stablest'' conjecture from theoretical computer
science, which was the original motivation for this work, and the ``It Ain't
Over Till It's Over'' conjecture from social choice theory.

stations offer service to customers of each class at possibly different rates.
The control corresponds to selecting what customer class each server serves at
each time. The diffusion control problem does not seem to have explicit
solutions and therefore a characterization of optimal solutions via the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is addressed. Our main result is the existence
and uniqueness of solutions of the equation. Since the model is set on an
unbounded domain and the cost per unit time is unbounded, the analysis requires
estimates on the state process that are subexponential in the time variable. In
establishing these estimates, a key role is played by an integral formula that
relates queue length and idle time processes, which may be of independent
interest.

mapping $T$ to $\frac{-T}{1+T}$. The discriminant of this form can be viewed as

underlying symmetric form is standard. It takes values in a quotient of
quaternionic homology $HQ_1(R)$ which is defined using natural operations on

the hierarchical sequence of random variables {X_n}_{n\ge 0} by
X_{n+1}=F(X_{n,1},...,X_{n,k}), where X_{n,i} are i.i.d. as X_n. Such sequences
arise from hierarchical structures which have been extensively studied in the
physics literature to model, for example, the conductivity of a random medium.
Under an averaging and smoothness condition on nontrivial F, an upper bound of
the form C\gamma^n for 0<\gamma<1 is obtained on the Wasserstein distance
between the standardized distribution of X_n and the normal. The results apply,
for instance, to random resistor networks and, introducing the notion of strict
averaging, to hierarchical sequences generated by certain compositions. As an
illustration, upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the normal are derived
for the hierarchical sequence generated by the weighted diamond lattice which
is shown to exhibit a full range of convergence rate behavior.

identified by no arbitrage arguments. However, the ``classical'' super
replication price is a sensible indicator of the (maximum selling) value of the

below), the super replication price is equal to sup_QE_Q[f], where Q varies on
the whole set of pricing measures. Unfortunately, this price is often too high:
a typical situation is here discussed in the examples. We thus define the less
expensive weak super replication price and we relax the requirements on f by
asking just for ``enough'' integrability conditions. By building up a proper
duality theory, we show its economic meaning and its relation with the
investor's preferences. Indeed, it turns out that the weak super replication
price of f coincides with sup_{Q\in M_{\Phi}}E_Q[f], where M_{\Phi} is the
class of pricing measures with finite generalized entropy (i.e., E[\Phi

exhibit unusual and interesting behavior. One of the simplest examples of such
a process is the two-node tandem Jackson network, with the ``phase'' giving the
state of the first queue and the ``level'' giving the state of the second
queue. In this paper, we undertake an extensive analysis of the properties of
this QBD. In particular, we investigate the spectral properties of Neuts's

show that we can obtain any decay rate from a certain range by controlling only
the transition structure at level zero, which is independent of R. We also
consider the sequence of tandem queues that is constructed by restricting the
waiting room of the first queue to some finite capacity, and then allowing this
capacity to increase to infinity. We show that the decay rates for the finite
truncations converge to a value, which is not necessarily the decay rate in the
infinite waiting room case. Finally, we show that the probability that the
process hits level n before level 0 given that it starts in level 1 decays at a
rate which is not necessarily the same as the decay rate for the stationary

approximates the option value at each time using a linear combination of basis

  Distribution with an Exponential Cutoff",,,,,"physics.soc-ph",,"  Recently several authors have proposed stochastic evolutionary models for the
growth of complex networks that give rise to power-law distributions. These
models are based on the notion of preferential attachment leading to the ``rich
get richer'' phenomenon. Despite the generality of the proposed stochastic
models, there are still some unexplained phenomena, which may arise due to the
limited size of networks such as protein, e-mail, actor and collaboration
networks. Such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the
power-law scaling, although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of
the distribution for extremely large networks. We propose a modification of the
basic stochastic evolutionary model, so that after a node is chosen
preferentially, say according to the number of its inlinks, there is a small
probability that this node will become inactive. We show that as a result of
this modification, by viewing the stochastic process in terms of an urn
transfer model, we obtain a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff.
Unlike many other models, the current model can capture instances where the
exponent of the distribution is less than or equal to two. As a proof of
concept, we demonstrate the consistency of our model empirically by analysing
the Mathematical Research collaboration network, the distribution of which is
known to follow a power law with an exponential cutoff.

Standard Model. These optical, non-imaging detectors generally contain a
""fiducial volume"" from which data are accepted, and an ""active buffer region""
where there are higher levels of radioactive contaminants. Events are observed
in real time. To distinguish between events occurring in the two regions, it is
imperative that event position reconstruction be well-understood. The object of
this paper is the study of the reconstruction, in time and space, of
scintillation events in detectors of large dimensions. A general,
likelihood-based method of position reconstruction for this class of detectors
is presented. The potential spatial resolution of the method is then evaluated.
It is shown that for a spherical detector with a large number N of
photosensitive elements that detect photons, the expected spatial resolution at
the center of the detector is given by delta a ~ (c sigma / n) sqrt(3/N), where
sigma is the width of the scintillator time response function and n is the
index of refraction in the medium. However, if light in the detector has a
scattering mean free path much less than the detector radius R, the resolution
instead becomes (R/2) sqrt(3/N). Finally, a formalism is introduced to deal
with the common case in which only the arrival time of the first photon to
arrive at each photosensitive element can be measured.

laws for heat and momentum, and employs an eddy diffusion parameterisation
which is dependent on both the wind speed and the wind stress applied at the
sea surface. Other parameters such as the bulk-skin surface temperature
difference and CO$_2$ flux are determined by application of the Molecular
Oceanic Boundary Layer Model (MOBLAM) of Schluessel and Soloviev. A similar
model, for the current profile only, predicts a temporary increase in wave
breaking intensity and decrease in wave height under conditions where the wind
speed increases suddenly, such as, for example, during gusts and squalls. The
model results are compared with measurements from the lagrangian Skin Depth
Experimental Profiler (SkinDeEP) surface profiling instrument made during the
1999 MOCE-5 field experiment in the waters around Baja California. SkinDeEP
made repeated profiles of temperature within the upper few metres of the water
column. Given that no tuning was performed in the model, and that the model
does not take account of stratification, the results of the model runs are in
rather good agreement with the observations. The model may be suitable as an
interface between time-independent models of processes very near the surface,
and larger-scale three-dimensional time-dependent ocean circulation models. A
straightforward extension of the model should also be suitable for making
time-dependent computations of gas concentration in the near-surface layer of

II). Although Eifler raises genuine issues regarding our model's validity and
applicability, we are nevertheless of the opinion that it is of value for the
short-term evolution of the upper-ocean profiles of current and temperature.
The fact that the effective eddy viscosity tends to infinity for infinite time
under a steady wind stress may not be surprising. It can be interpreted as a
vertical shift of the eddy viscosity profile and an increase in the size of the
dominant turbulent eddies under the assumed conditions of small stratification
and infinite water depth.

around the Gaussian peak. For a bimodal landscape the platforms located at
different peaks get different numbers of voters.

generation rate of 165bit/s, which is 1/4 of the theoretical limit, can be
obtained over 15km of a Telecom fiber. We also show that with the same
experimental parameters, not even a single bit of secure key can be extracted
with a non-decoy-state protocol. Compared to building single photon sources,
decoy state QKD is a much simpler method for increasing the distance and key
generation rate of unconditionally secure QKD.

classical system, there is a simple rule which allows them to pool their

applicability is necessarily more limited, it does apply to a large class of
measurements, and we show explicitly for a single qubit that it satisfies the
intuitive notions of what it means to pool knowledge about a quantum system.
This analysis also provides a physical interpretation for the trace of the

description of the extreme rays of the dual cone, i.e. the cone of the
corresponding positive linear maps. We compute the radius of the largest ball

application we obtain lower bounds on the radius of the largest ball of
separable unnormalized states around the identity matrix for a multi-qubit
