photometry and simple spectral fitting for our detected sources, and construct
luminosity functions, X-ray color-magnitude and color-color diagrams.
Eighty-seven X-ray sources show variability on timescales from hours to years.
Thirty-one of the new X-ray sources are identified with chromospherically
active binaries from the catalogs of Albrow et al. The radial distributions of
detected sources imply roughly 70 are background sources of some kind. Most
source spectra are well-fit by thermal plasma models, except for quiescent
low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs, containing accreting neutron stars) and
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We identify three new candidate qLMXBs with
relatively low X-ray luminosities. One of the brightest cataclysmic variables
(CVs, X10) shows evidence (a 4.7 hour period pulsation and strong soft X-ray
emission) for a magnetically dominated accretion flow as in AM Her systems.
Most of the bright CVs require intrinsic N_H columns of order 10^{21} cm^-2,
suggesting a possible DQ Her nature. A group of X-ray sources associated with
bright (sub)giant stars also requires intrinsic absorption. By comparing the
X-ray colors, luminosities, variability, and quality of spectral fits of the
detected MSPs to those of unidentified sources, we estimate that a total of
\~25-30 MSPs exist in 47 Tuc (<60 at 95% confidence), regardless of their radio
beaming fraction. We estimate that the total number of neutron stars in 47 Tuc
is of order 300, reducing the discrepancy between theoretical neutron star
retention rates and observed neutron star populations in globular clusters.

the sample primarily consists of blazars with parsec-scale morphologies
consisting of a bright core component at the extreme end of a one-sided jet. At
least one third of the compact cores are completely unresolved on the longest
VLBA baselines, indicating brightness temperatures above 10^{11} K. The
unresolved cores tend to have electric vectors that are aligned with the inner
jet direction, suggesting the presence of a stationary transverse shock near
the base of the jet. Many of the extended jet regions display exceedingly high
fractional polarizations (> 50%) and electric vectors aligned with the jet
ridge line, consistent with optically thin emission from transverse shocks.
Both weak- and strong-lined blazars show a general increase in fractional
polarization with distance down the jet, but BL Lac jets are generally more
polarized and have electric vectors preferentially aligned with the local jet
direction. We show that these differences are intrinsic to the jets, and not
due to sample bias. Distinct features in the jets of gamma-ray loud (EGRET)
blazars are typically twice as luminous as those in non-EGRET blazars, and are
more polarized. These differences can be adequately explained if EGRET blazars
have slightly higher Doppler boosting factors than those not yet detected in

in redshift (0.3<z<0.9) from a 1.4 deg^2 region in the Bootes field of the NOAO
Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS). The red galaxies are early-type,
bulge-dominated galaxies and are selected to have the same evolution corrected,
absolute R-band magnitude distribution as a function of redshift to ensure we
are tracing the evolution in the X-ray properties of a comparable optical
population. Using a stacking analysis of 5-ks Chandra/ACIS observations within
this field to study the X-ray emission from these red galaxies in three
redshift bins, we find that the mean X-ray luminosity increases as a function
of redshift. The large mean X-ray luminosity and the hardness of the mean X-ray
spectrum suggests that the X-ray emission is largely dominated by AGN rather
than stellar sources. The hardness ratio can be reproduced by either an
absorbed (N_H ~2 x 10^22 cm^-2) Gamma=1.7 power-law source, consistent with
that of a population of moderately obscured Seyfert-like AGN, or an unabsorbed
Gamma=0.7 source suggesting a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (e.g., an
advection-dominated accretion flow). We also find that the emission from this
sample of red galaxies constitutes at least 5% of the hard X-ray background.
These results suggest a global decline in the mean AGN activity of normal
early-type galaxies from z~1 to the present, which indicates that we are
witnessing the tailing off of the accretion activity onto SMBHs in early-type
galaxies since the quasar epoch.

address three questions: what can be inferred about 1) mass, 2) composition and
3) extension of outer convection zones of solar analogs in the Hyades. The
first issue relies on the strong sensitivity of the large separation to mass.
Then large separations and second differences are used to respectively
constrain metal and helium fractions in the Hyades.When plotted for several
masses, the relation of effective temperature vs large separation is found to
be strongly dependent on the metal content. Besides this the second difference
main modulation is related to the second ionization of helium.The second
difference modulations are also partly due to the discontinuity in stellar
stratification at the convective envelope / radiative core transition. They
permit direct insight in the stellar structure. We compute acoustic radii of
the convective bases for different values of the mixing length theoryparameter

electrodynamics. alpha = e^2/(4pi epsilon hbar c), where e is the charge of the
electron, epsilon is vacuum permittivity, c is the speed of light, and hbar is
Planck's constant divided by 2pi. This inquiry was motivated by Schrodinger's
(1939) prediction that all quantum wave functions coevolve with Friedmann
geometry and a similar prediction by Sumner (1994) for vacuum permittivity. The
functional form of variations in quantum wave functions found by Schrodinger is
enough to show that alpha does not vary. Electrodynamics also predicts that
alpha does not vary. Evolutionary changes in c exactly cancel those in vacuum
permittivity and other factors in alpha do not change. Since alpha appears in
all first-order perturbation formulas for atomic energy levels, comparisons of
the atomic spectra of distant atoms with those in laboratories provide an
experimental measure of this prediction. Most experiments find changes in alpha
that are either statistically zero or very small. These results and estimates
of the Hubble constant and deceleration parameter from precision
redshift/magnitude data support a major assumption of this paper that the
Friedmann solution to Einstein's theory of general relativity without

accretions of dark matter with infinitesimal velocity dispersion. A simple
rescaling shows that similarly to the case of absolutely cold medium these
profiles are universal: they are valid for all caustics and irrespective of
physical parameters of the halo. We derive the maximum density of the caustics
and show that it depends on the velocity dispersion and the caustic location.
We show that both the absolute and relative thickness of the caustic
monotonically decrease toward the center of the halo while the maximum density
grows. This indicates that the radial component of the thermal velocities
decreases in the inner streams, i.e. the collisionless medium cools down in the
radial direction descending to the center of the halo. Finally, we demonstrate
that there can be a significant contribution to the emission measure from dark
matter particle annihilation in the caustics.

scatter of the Fundamental Plane (FP) as a function of redshift and
morphological properties, carefully accounting for luminosity-dependent biases
via Montecarlo simulations. The evolution of the overall FP can be represented
by a mean change in effective mass-to-light ratio given by <d \log (M/L_{\rm

significantly on the dynamical mass, being slower for larger masses as reported
in a previous letter. In addition, we separately show the intrinsic scatter of
the FP increases with redshift as d(rms(M/L_{\rm B}))/dz=0.040\pm0.015.
Although these trends are consistent with single burst populations which formed
at $z_f>2$ for high mass spheroidals and z_{f}~1.2 for lower mass systems, a
more realistic picture is that most of the stellar mass formed in all systems
at z>2 with subsequent activity continuing to lower redshifts (z<1.2). The
fraction of stellar mass formed at recent times depend strongly on galactic
mass, ranging from <1% for masses above 10^{11.5} M_{\odot} to 20-40% below

presently empty, they would fill in on time scales of a million years. This can
exceed the lifetime of a YSO outflow phase, or the transit time of the central
star through the cavity, explaining the the absence of any clear correlation
between the cavities and YSO outflows. We find that the momentum and energy
deposition associated with the expansion of the cavities is sufficient to power
the turbulence in the cloud. In this way we conclude that the cavities are an
important intermediary step between the conversion of YSO outflow energy and
momentum into cloud turbulent motions.

in lower-mass galaxies, so that the stellar content dominates the mass budget
out to ~5r_e; (3) the radial gradient in the dark-matter fraction for these
intermediate redshift galaxies agrees with published data on nearby galaxies.
This result can help reconcile the discrepancies found in recent estimates of
dark matter in elliptical galaxies using different techniques (e.g. Planetary

massive galaxies extends further out in terms of the dark matter scale radius.

sources are assumed to follow a uniform ellipticity distribution from 0 to 0.5
and to have an area identical to a circular source with diameter $1\arcsec$. We
find that the optical depth scales as the source redshift approximately as
$\tau_{1''} = 2.25 \times 10^{-6}/[1+(\zs/3.14)^{-3.42}]$ ($0.6<\zs<7$). The
amplitude is about 50% higher for an effective source diameter of $0.5\arcsec$.
The optimal lens redshift for giant arcs with the length-to-width ratio ($L/W$)
larger than 10 increases from 0.3 for $\zs=1$, to 0.5 for $\zs=2$, and to
0.7-0.8 for $\zs>3$. The optical depth is sensitive to the source redshift, in
qualitative agreement with Wambsganss et al. (2004). However, our overall
optical depth appears to be only $\sim$ 10% to 70% of those from previous
studies. The differences can be mostly explained by different power spectrum
normalizations ($\sigma_8$) used and different ways of determining the $L/W$
ratio. Finite source size and ellipticity have modest effects on the optical
depth. We also found that the number of highly magnified (with magnification
$|\mu|>10$) and ``undistorted'' images (with $L/W<3$) is comparable to the
number of giant arcs with $|\mu|>10$ and $L/W>10$. We conclude that our
predicted rate of giant arcs may be lower than the observed rate, although the
precise `discrepancy' is still unclear due to uncertainties both in theory and

Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper the observed emission is assumed to be
due to a population of relativistic, non-thermal electrons (e.g. produced in a
flare) injected at the top of an accretion disk magnetic loop. While electrons
stream along magnetic field lines their energy distribution evolves in time
essentially because of inverse Compton and synchrotron losses. The
corresponding time dependent emission due, in the X-ray energy range, to the
inverse Compton mechanism, has been computed. Since the typical decay time of a
flare is shorter than the integration time for data acquisition in the X-ray
domain, the resulting spectrum is derived as the temporal mean of the real,
time-dependent, emission, as originated by a series of consecutive and
identical flares. The model outcome is compared to both the broad band BeppoSAX
X-ray data of the bright Seyfert 1 NGC 5548, and to a few general X-ray
spectral properties of Seyfert 1s as a class. The good agreement between model
and observations suggests that the presently proposed non-thermal,
non-stationary model could be a plausible explanation of AGN X-ray emission, as
an alternative to thermal coronae models.

elliptical galaxies are presented. These were derived considering the following
observational facts. Firstly, ``core'' galaxies, which are thought to have had
their inner region depleted from the coalesence of supermassive black holes,
show an abrupt downward deviation of their inner light-profile relative to
their outer Sersic profile. Second, ``power-law'' galaxies, having undisturbed
profiles and no partially depleted core, have inner light-profiles that display
no departure from the inward extrapolation of their outer Sersic profile. The
central stellar deficits have therefore been derived from the difference in
flux between the HST-observed galaxy light-profiles and the inward
extrapolation of each galaxy's outer Sersic profile. This approach gives flux
deficits ~0.1% of the total galaxy light, and mass deficits that are ~2 times
each galaxy's central supermassive black hole mass. These results are in
agreement with the theoretical expectations of mass ejection from binary black
hole mergers and also with popular LCDM models of hierarchical galaxy
formation. It is also explained why this result is some 10 times smaller than
current observational estimates of the central mass deficit, and therefore
implies a merger history for giant elliptical galaxies that is one order of
magnitude less violent than previously suggested.

independent of these parameters. The difference between the rotation measures

significatively strong use of the hybridization terms of the Hamiltonian, and
have a much larger Kondo-like correlation energy than a single impurity (the
Kondo energy). Furthermore, these Doublets combine to form a Super-Singlet.
This Super-Singlet makes use of the remaining hybridization probability to
improve its energy with respect to the Doublets energy, but for low-Dimensional
systems and at the inter-impurity distances where the Doublets are full
developed, its energy gain is exponentially small. The interaction behind the
Doublets is a first-order (in the effective Kondo coupling) one, it also
generates a parallel alignment of the impurity-spins. This ferromagnetic
impurity-impurity response is thus generated without resort to the RKKY

also much larger than the one of the RKKY interaction.

two interconnected file-based storage mechanisms that are made accessible in a

Objects are concatenated into a single file named an XMLtape. An XMLtape is a
valid XML file; its format definition is independent of the choice of the
XML-based complex object format by which Digital Objects are represented. The
creation of indexes for both the identifier and the creation datetime of the
XML-based representation of the Digital Objects facilitates OAI-PMH-based
access to Digital Objects stored in an XMLtape. Second, ARC files, as
introduced by the Internet Archive, are used to contain the constituent
datastreams of the Digital Objects in a concatenated manner. An index for the
identifier of the datastream facilitates OpenURL-based access to an ARC file.
The interconnection between XMLtapes and ARC files is provided by conveying the
identifiers of ARC files associated with an XMLtape as administrative

particular, we study in detail two different boosts along axes orthogonal and
parallel to the plane of the ring circle, respectively. In both cases, after
the limit one obtains a five-dimensional impulsive pp-wave propagating in
Minkowski spacetime. The curvature singularity of the original static spacetime
becomes a singular source within the wave front, in the shape of a ring or a
rod according to the direction of the boost. In the case of an orthogonal
boost, the wave front contains also a remnant of the original disk-shaped
membrane as a component of the Ricci tensor (which is everywhere else
vanishing). We also analyze the asymptotic properties of the boosted black ring
at large spatial distances from the singularity, and its behaviour near the
sources. In the limit when the singularity shrinks to a point, one recovers the
well known five-dimensional analogue of the Aichelburg-Sexl ``monopole''

proportion to the volume at that time, also leads to a monotonically decreasing

  It is shown that in the context of multi-brane world constructions with

latter scenario is realized, the KK spectrum contains special ultralight and
localized KK state(s). Existence of such states give the possibility that
gravitational interactions as we realize them are the net effect of the
massless graviton and the special KK state(s). Models that reproduce Newtonian
gravity at intermediate distances even in the absence of massless graviton are
also discussed. It shown that the massless limit of the propagator of massive
graviton in curved spacetime ($AdS$ or $dS$) is smooth in contrast to the case
that the spacetime is flat (vDVZ discontinuity). The latter suggests that in
the presence of local a curvature (\textit{e.g.} curvature induced by the
source) the discontinuity in the graviton propagator disappears avoiding the
phenomenological difficulties of models with massive gravitons. The possibility
of generating small neutrino masses through sterile bulk neutrino in the

non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential can arise from an Euclidean

give rise to fermion masses and are important in determining these corrections.
We find that the three-form flux generically breaks a U(1) subgroup of the

derive a set of transition conditions for the dispersive shock, actually

why they may require different optimizations and figures of merit. Most of this

spectral hole (26Hz) within the homogeneous absorption line of the optical
transition of an Erbium ion-doped crystal. The large dispersion of the index of
refraction associated with this hole permits to achieve a group velocity as low
as 2.7m/s with a ransmission of 40%. We especially benefit from the
inhomogeneous absorption broadening of the ions to tune both the transmission
coefficient, from 40% to 90%, and the light group velocity from 2.7m/s to
100m/s.

the adhesion, through MOCA protein, on cell locomotion. The MOCA protein
regulates cell-cell adhesion, and we explore its potential role in the cell
movement. We present a series of statistical descriptions of the motion in
order to characterize the cell movement, and found that MOCA affects the
statistical scenario of cell locomotion. In particular, we observe that MOCA
enhances the tendency of joint motion, inhibits super-diffusion, and decreases
overall cell motion. These facts are compatible with the hypothesis that the
cells move faster in a less cohesive environment. Furthermore, we observe that
velocity distribution tails are longer than those predicted by
Maxwell-Boltzmann in all cases studied here, indicating that cell movement is
more complex than that of a liquid.

deflates ""quantum mysteries"" and relates non-relativistic quantum mechanics to

fundamental in a blockworld setting, i.e., by interpreting spacetime relations
as fundamental to relata. To justify this Relational Blockworld (RBW), we adopt
a result due to G. Kaiser whereby the relativity of simultaneity, stemming from
the Poincare algebra of special relativity, is responsible for the canonical
commutation relations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. And, we
incorporate a result due to A. Bohr, B. Mottelson and O. Ulfbeck whereby the
density matrix for a given experimental situation is obtained from its
spacetime symmetry group. We provide an example to illustrate the explanatory
nature of RBW and conclude by explaining how RBW deflates ""quantum mysteries.""

renormalization group limit cycle. Here, we consider the renormalization of the
1/r^2 potential in momentum space. We regulate the problem with a momentum
cutoff and absorb the cutoff dependence using a momentum-independent
counterterm potential. The strength of this counterterm is uniquely determined
and runs on a limit cycle. We also calculate the bound state spectrum and
scattering observables, emphasizing the manifestation of the limit cycle in
these observables.

between observable (localization at the slits) and state (being on both slits).
Relation between an observable and a quantum state is investigated in the
general case. It is assumed that the amount of ceherence equals that of
incompatibility between observable and state. On ground of this, an argument is
peresented that leads to a natural quantum measure of coherence, called
""coherence or incompatibility information"". Its properties are studied in
detail making use of 'the mixing property of relative entropy' derived in this
article. A precise relation between the measure of coherence of an observable
and that of its coarsening is obtained and discussed from the intutitive point
of view. Convexity of the measure is proved, and thus the fact that it is an
information entity is established. A few more detailed properties of coherence
information are derived with a view to investigate final-state entanglement in
general repeatable measurement, and, more importantly, general bipartite
entanglement in follow ups of this study.

which are invariant under product representations of the group SO(3) of
three-dimensional proper rotations is analyzed. The subsystems represent
particles of arbitrary spin j which transform according to an irreducible
representation of the rotation group. A positive map theta is introduced which
describes the time reversal symmetry of the local states and which is unitarily
equivalent to the transposition of matrices. It is shown that the partial time
reversal transformation theta_2 = (I tensor theta) acting on the composite
system can be expressed in terms of the invariant 6-j symbols introduced by
Wigner into the quantum theory of angular momentum. This fact enables a
complete geometrical construction of the manifold of states with positive
partial transposition and of the sets of separable and entangled states of (4
tensor 4) systems. The separable states are shown to form a three-dimensional
prism and a three-dimensional manifold of bound entangled states is identified.
A positive maps is obtained which yields, together with the time reversal, a
necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of states of (4 tensor
4) systems. The relations to the reduction criterion and to the recently
proposed cross norm criterion for separability are discussed.
