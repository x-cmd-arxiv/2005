uniform density distribution with models with the same central stars and
chemical compositions but with 3-D hierarchical clumps. We compare the
abundances of He, N, O, Ne, and S obtained from emission line strengths and [O
III] and [N II] temperatures to those in our models. We consider stellar
temperatures in the range 37.5 -- 45kK and ionizing luminosities from 10^{48}
to 10^{51} photons/s.
  Clumped models have different ionic abundances than uniform. For hot stars,
He^0/He^+ is 2 -- 3%, much larger than with uniform models. This amount of He I
is independent of metallicity and so impacts the determination of the
primordial abundance of He. The total abundances of O, Ne, and S obtained by
the usual methods of analysis, using T([OIII) for high stages of ionization and
T([NII]) for low, are about as accurate for clumped models as for uniform and
within about 20% of the true values. If T([OIII]) is used for analyzing all
ions, the derived (O/H) is 40 to 60% too large for cool stars but is good for
hot stars. Uniform models have similar errors, so the clumping does not change
the accuracy of abundance analysis.
  The physical causes of the ionic abundance errors are present in real
nebulae. In clumped models, helium ionizing radiation from zones of high
ionization (low He^0 and low UV opacity) can penetrate nearby regions near the
edge of the ionized zone. This effect allows He^0 to absorb more stellar
photons than in uniform or radially symmetrical geometries. In turn, these
absorptions compete with O+, etc., for those energetic stellar photons.

migration from their point of origin in the protoplanetary disk -- both because
of their close proximity to the star (30 and 60 day orbital periods) and
because of their occupying three stable orbital resonances at the 2:1
mean-motion commensurability. The resonances were most likely established by
converging differential migration of the planets leading to capture into the
resonances. A problem with this scenario is that continued migration of the
system while it is trapped in the resonances leads to orbital eccentricities
that rapidly exceed the observational upper limits of e_1 = 0.31 and e_2 =
0.05. As seen in forced 3-body simulations, lower eccentricities would persist
during migration only for an applied eccentricity damping.
  Here we explore the evolution of the GJ 876 system using two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations that include viscous heating and radiative effects.
We find that a hydrodynamic evolution within the resonance, where only the
outer planet interacts with the disk, always rapidly leads to large values of
eccentricities that exceed those observed.
  Only if mass is removed from the disk on a time scale of the order of the
migration time scale (before there has been extensive migration after capture),
as might occur for photoevaporation in the late phases of planet formation, can
we end up with eccentricities that are consistent with the observations.

evolve autonomously all the time except for in discrete asynchronous instances

for simulating such systems. Rather than maintaining and updating the global
state of the system, the algorithm tries to examine only essential events,
i.e., component interactions. The events are processed in a non-decreasing
order of time; new interactions are scheduled on the basis of the examined
interactions using preintegrated equations of the evolutions of the components.
If the components are distributed uniformly enough in the evolution space, so
that this space can be subdivided into small sectors such that only O(1)
sectors and O(1)$components are in the neighborhood of a sector, then the
algorithm spends time O (log N) for processing an event which is the
asymptotical minimum. The algorithm uses a simple strategy for handling data:
only two states are maintained for each simulated component. Fast data access
in this strategy assures the practical efficiency of the algorithm. It works
noticeably faster than other algorithms proposed for this model.

photoexcited electron-hole system in the presence of stimulated binding
processes which build up near exciton degeneracy. It is shown that such
processes may give rise to Turing instability leading to a spatially modulated
state. The structure and symmetry of resulting patterns depend on
dimensionality and symmetry. In the spatially uniform 2d electron-hole system,
the instability leads to a triangular lattice pattern while, at an
electron-hole interface, a periodic 1d pattern develops. Wavelength selection
mechanism is analyzed, revealing that the transition is abrupt (type I) for the
uniform 2d system, and continuous (type II) for the electron-hole interface.
Another mechanism that could possibly drive the instability involves long-range
attraction of the excitons. We illustrate how such an interaction can result
from current induced by exciton recombination ('plasmon wind'), derive
stability criterion, and discuss likelihood of such a scenario.

for possible confinement mechanisms in gauge theories. Today, with a clear but
puzzling ``spaghetti'' confinement pattern, arising after a decade of lattice
computer experiments, which implies formation of a fluctuating net of peculiar
magnetic vortices rather than condensation of the homogeneously distributed
magnetic monopoles, the time is coming to reverse the logic and search for
similar patterns in condensed matter systems. The main thing to look for in a
condensed matter setup is the simultaneous existence of narrow tubes
($P$-vortices or 1-branes) of direction-changing electric field and broader
tubes (Abrikosov lines) of magnetic field, a pattern dual to the one,
presumably underlying confinement in gluodynamics. As a possible place for this
search we suggest systems with coexisting charge-density waves and
superconductivity.

The roles of the G-layer on the origins of (1) a high large tensile growth
stress, (2) a large longitudinal Young's modulus, and (3) a high longitudinal
drying shrinkage in the tension wood xylem were discussed on the basis of the
simulations using the G-fiber model. The results suggest that the G-layer
generates a high tensile stress in the longitudinal direction during the xylem
maturation; the longitudinal Young's modulus of the green G-layer becomes
significantly higher than that of the lignified layer; furthermore, the G-layer
tends to shrink extraordinarily higher than that of the lignified layer during
the moisture desorption.

  Opt. 7 (2005) S1-S6",,"10.1088/1464-4266/7/10/011",,"quant-ph",,"  As is well known, when an SU(2) operation acts on a two-level system, its
Bloch vector rotates without change of magnitude. Considering a system composed
of two two-level systems, it is proven that for a class of nonlocal
interactions of the two subsystems including \sigma_i\otimes\sigma_j (with i,j
\in {x,y,z}) and the Heisenberg interaction, the geometric description of the
motion is particularly simple: each of the two Bloch vectors follows an
elliptical orbit within the Bloch sphere. The utility of this result is
demonstrated in two applications, the first of which bears on quantum control
via quantum interfaces. By employing nonunitary control operations, we extend
the idea of controllability to a set of points which are not necessarily
connected by unitary transformations. The second application shows how the
orbit of the coherence vector can be used to assess the entangling power of
Heisenberg exchange interaction.
