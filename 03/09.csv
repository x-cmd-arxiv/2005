simulations of large scale structure to describe the underlying density field
with an analytic model based on extended Press-Schechter theory to track the
reionization process. We find that the power spectrum of the induced CMB
anisotropies depends sensitively on the character of the reionization epoch.
Models that differ in the extent of the ""patchy phase"" could be distinguished
by future experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the
South Pole Telescope (SPT). In our models, the patchy signal peaks at $l\simeq
2000$, where it can be four times larger than the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ)/Ostriker-Vishniac (OV) signal ($\Delta T_{\rm tot} \simeq 2.6 \mu K$). On
scales beyond $l \simeq 4000$ the total Doppler signal is dominated by kSZ/OV,
but the patchy signal can contribute up to 30% to the power spectrum. The
effect of patchy reionization is largest on scales where the primordial CMB
anisotropies dominate. Ignoring this contribution could lead to significant
biases in the determination of cosmological parameters derived from CMB
temperature measurements. Improvements in the theoretical modeling of the
reionization epoch will become increasingly important to interpret the results

studies, we find a positive correlation between high spectral index, alpha, and
high submillimeter flux, with the difference being accounted for by different
treatments of the error beam. We interpret the higher spectral index at
submillimeter peaks as a reflection of elevated dust temperature, particularly
when there is an embedded infrared source, though it may also reflect changing
dust properties. The clump mass-radius relationship is well-fit by a power law
of the form M \propto R^(-x) with x = 1.5-2.1, consistent with theories of
turbulently-supported clumps. According to our most reliable analysis, the
high-mass end (approx. 100-2700 M_sun) of the submillimeter clump mass function
in NGC 7538 follows a Salpeter-like power law with index 2.0 +/- 0.3. This
result agrees well with similar studies of lower-mass regions rho Oph and Orion

of slowly pulsating B stars. A new nonadiabatic code, that adopts the so-called
`traditional approximation' to treat the Coriolis force, is used to investigate
the influence exerted by rotation over the stability of stellar models covering
the mass range 2.5 M_sun <= M_* <= 13.0 M_sun. The principal finding is that,
for all modes considered apart from the prograde sectoral class, rotation
shifts the kappa-mechanism instability toward higher luminosities and effective
temperatures; these shifts are accompanied by broadenings in the extent of
instability strips. Such behaviour is traced to the shortening of mode periods
under the action of the Coriolis force. Instability strips associated with
prograde sectoral modes behave rather differently, being shifted to marginally
lower luminosities and effective temperatures under the influence of rotation.
  The implications of these results are discussed in the context of the
observational scarcity of pulsation in B-type stars having significant
rotation; various scenarios are explored to explain the apparent dichotomy
between theory and observations. Furthermore, the possible significance of the
findings to Be stars is briefly examined.

simplicity, we have employed only spherical components (bulge and halo) of the
galaxy. Total number of stars in our simulations was about 20,000. All
simulations were done for several orbital periods in order to understand the
development of the tidal tails. In our scaled down models, the relaxation time
is sufficiently short to show the mass segregation effect, but we did not go
far enough to see the core-collapse, and the fraction of stars lost from the
cluster at the end of simulation is only about 10%. The radial distribution of
extra-tidal stars can be described by a power law with a slope around -3. The
direction of tidal tails are determined by the orbits and locations of the
clusters. We find that the length of tidal tails increases towards the
apogalacticon and decreases towards the perigalacticon. This is an
anti-correlation with the strength of the tidal field, caused by the fact that
the the time-scale for the stars to respond to the potential is similar to the
orbital time-scale of the cluster. When the length of tidal tails decreases
some of the stars in the tidal tails are recaptured by the host cluster. From
the investigation of velocity anisotropy of the model clusters, we find that in
the early stages of globular cluster evolution the clusters have radial
anisotropy in the outermost parts, while clusters are nearly isotropic in the
cental region. The radial anisotropy decreases with time.

collapse of a neutron star to a black hole; and (iii) an accretion spin-up when

system can be effectively mapped on a random model which is described in
statistical terms. For this purpose we generalize the simple trap model of
Bouchaud and coworkers by dividing the total system into M weakly interacting
identical subsystems, each being described in terms of a trap model. The
distribution of traps in this extended trap model (ETM) is fully determined by
the thermodynamics of the glass-former. The dynamics is described by two
adjustable parameters, one characterizing the common energy level of the
barriers, the other the strength of the interaction. The comparison is
performed for the standard binary mixture Lennard-Jones system with 65
particles. The metabasins, identified in our previous work, are chosen as
traps. Comparing molecular dynamics simulations of the Lennard-Jones system
with Monte Carlo calculations of the ETM allows one to determine the adjustable
parameters. Analysis of the first moment of the waiting distribution yields an
optimum agreement when choosing M=3 subsystems. Comparison with the second
moment of the waiting time distribution, reflecting dynamic heterogeneities,
indicates that the sizes of the subsystems may fluctuate.

self-archiving of peer-reviewed journal articles (the ""Green"" road to OA). He
suggests instead that we should convert to Open Access Publishing (the ""Golden""
road to OA) by ""mixing and matching"" Green and Gold as follows: o First,
self-archive dissertations (not published, peer-reviewed journal articles). o
Second, identify and tag how those dissertations have been evaluated and
reviewed. o Third, self-archive unrefereed preprints (not published,
peer-reviewed journal articles). o Fourth, develop new mechanisms for
evaluating and reviewing those unrefereed preprints, at multiple levels. The
result will be OA Publishing (Gold). I argue that rather than yet another 10
years of speculation like this, what is actually needed (and imminent) is for
OA self-archiving to be mandated by research funders and institutions so that
the self-archiving of published, peer-reviewed journal articles (Green) can be

the parameters of the standard model correspond to having a maximally

constant as a example, we attempt to justify the assertion that at least a mild

interaction between pairs of spacetime points that is identical for all pairs

contributions to be reparametrization invariant. However, even this form of
non-locality potentially harbours time-machine-like paradoxes. These are

obstacle in the NF, only its resonant part is included, and the remainder is
assigned to the homological equation. This leaves the NF intergable and its
solutons retain the character of the solutions of the unperturbed equation. We
exploit the freedom in the expansion to construct canonical obstacles which are
confined to te interaction region of the waves. Fo soliton solutions, e.g., in
the KdV equation, the interaction region is a finite domain around the origin;
the canonical obstacles then do not generate secular terms in the homological
equation. When the interaction region is infifnite, or semi-infinite, e.g., in
wave-front solutions of the Burgers equation, the obstacles may contain
resonant terms. The obstacles generate waves of a new type, which cannot be
written as functionals of the solutions of the NF. When an obstacle contributes
a resonant term to the NF, this leads to a non-standard update of th wave
velocity.

is that a guide field \approx 0.1 times as strong as the asymptotic
reconnecting field -- roughly the field strength at which the electron Larmor
radius is comparable to the width of the electron current layer -- is
sufficient to magnetize the electrons in the vicinity of the x-line, thus
causing significant changes to the structure of the electron dissipation
region. This implies that great care should be exercised before concluding that
magnetospheric reconnection is antiparallel. We also find that even for such
weak guide fields strong inward-flowing electron beams form in the vicinity of
the magnetic separatrices and Buneman-unstable distribution functions arise at
the x-line itself. As in the calculations of {\it Hesse et al.} [2002] and {\it
Yin and Winske} [2003], the non-gyrotropic elements of the electron pressure
tensor play the dominant role in decoupling the electrons from the magnetic
field at the x-line, regardless of the magnitude of the guide field and the
associated strong variations in the pressure tensor's spatial structure.
Despite these changes, and consistent with previous work, the reconnection rate
does not vary appreciably with the strength of the guide field as it changes
between 0 and a value equal to the asymptotic reversed field.

independently in a refracting medium, the exception of laser beams may be
extended to usual time-incoherent light provided that conditions of

the simplest one being atomic hydrogen in 2S and 2P states (called H* here).
  The interaction increases the entropy of a set of beams without a permanent
excitation of H*, a loss of energy by a beam having a high Planck's temperature
producing a decrease of its frequency, and the thermal radiation getting
energy.
  Atomic hydrogen in its ground state is pumped to H* by Lyman alpha
absorptions, producing a redshift of the light. The combination of the Lyman
absorptions and the redshifts they produce, induce oscillations which generate
a spectrum in which the lines deduce from each other by relative frequency
shifts which are products of an integer by a constant z_b=0.062.
  These purely physical results may be applied in astrophysics, searching where
H* may appear. In particular, the computed spectra of the accreting neutron
stars, remarkably identical to the spectra of the quasars, may explain that
these stars seem never observed. The too high frequencies of the radio signals
from the Pioneer probes may result from a transfer of energy from the solar
light allowed by a cooling of the solar wind able to produce H*. A similar
transfer to the CMB may explain its anisotropy bound to the ecliptic.

"physics/0503072","Boris Chirikov","Boris Chirikov","Creating chaos and the Life",,,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  In this short report the first attempt of a new approach to the still
mysterious phenomenon of the life, and its peak, the human being, is presented
from the view point of the natural sciences, i.e. of the physics in the broad
sense of the word. This idea has come to my mind about 10 years ago when doing
a completely different problem I suddenly have noticed to my surprise (see [1],
p.20) a wonderful relation between a very complicated human (physical)
conception {\it creation} and the relatively simple mathematical theorem due to
Alekseev - Brudno (see for instance [2]) in an almost unknown for physicists
field of the so-called {\it symbolic dynamics} and {\it algorithmic chaos},
which one I have immediately christen {\it the creating chaos}.

dissipative chaotic system described by the Zaslavsky map. For strong
dissipation the quantum wave function in the phase space collapses onto a
compact packet which follows classical chaotic dynamics and whose area is
proportional to the Planck constant. At weak dissipation the exponential
instability of quantum dynamics on the Ehrenfest time scale dominates and leads
to wave packet explosion. The transition from collapse to explosion takes place
when the dissipation time scale exceeds the Ehrenfest time. For integrable
nonlinear dynamics the explosion practically disappears leaving place to
collapse.

implications for quantum and classical systems. These concepts are illustrated
on a macroscopic model for the singlet state of a quantum system of two
entangled spin 1/2 with a parameter reflecting indeterminism in the measurement
procedure. By varying this parameter we describe situations from quantum,
intermediate to classical and study which tests are compatible or separated. We
prove that for classical deterministic systems the concepts of separability and
compatibility coincide, but for quantum systems and intermediate systems these
concepts are generally different.

analyze a one-dimensional walk in position space, with the coin, the additional
qubit degree of freedom that controls the displacement of the quantum walker,
implemented as a spatially delocalized qubit, i.e., the coin is also encoded in
position space. We analyze the dependence of the quantum walk on temperature
and experimental imperfections as shaking in the trap positions. Finally,
combining a spatially delocalized qubit and a hyperfine qubit, we also give a
scheme to realize a quantum walk on a two-dimensional square lattice with the
possibility of implementing different coin operators.
