intracluster medium (ICM) using a catalog of 1,836 mock Astro-E2 observations
of simulated clusters of galaxies. We generate high resolution mock spectra for
two observing strategies: a four-pointing mosaic and a single central pointing.
Normalizing to 200 (400) photons in the iron K-alpha region for the mosaic
(central) study, we fit Poisson realizations of each simulated spectrum to a
velocity broadened isothermal plasma emission model. We confirm that the
velocity characteristics (mean and dispersion) returned by the spectral
fittings are unbiased measures of the emission-weighted values within the
observed region, with scatter 55 km/s. The maximum velocity difference between
mosaic element pairs $\Delta v_{\rm max}$ has ~ 6% likelihood of being
transonic ($\Delta v_{\rm max} \ge 0.5 c_s$), and the likelihood falls steeply,
$p \spropto (\Delta v_{\rm max}/c_s)^{-4}$, at high Mach number. The velocity
broadening parameter $\sigma_v$ from the central pointing fit exceeds the
thermal value in 49% of the cases, with again a $\sigma_v^{-4}$ tail at large
dispersion. We present as case studies the clusters that yield the strongest
signal for each observing strategy.

how to measure it with weak gravitational lensing. The method entails choosing
a large of pairs of foreground lens galaxies and constructing a mean shear map
with respect to their axis, by averaging the ellipticities of background source
galaxies. An average mass map can be reconstructed from this shear map and this
will represent the average mass distribution around pairs of galaxies. We show
how this mass map is related to the projected galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point
correlation function. Using a large N-body dark matter simulation populated
with galaxies using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) bias prescription,
we compute these correlation functions, mass maps, and shear maps. The
resultant mass maps are distinctly bimodal, tracing the galaxy centers and
remaining anisotropic up to scales much larger than the galaxy separation. At
larger scales, the shear is approximately tangential about the center of the
pair but with small azimuthal variation in amplitude. We estimate the
signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed mass maps for a survey of similar
depth to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and conclude that the
galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point function should be measurable with the current
SDSS weak lensing data. Measurements of this three-point function, along with
galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy auto-correlation functions, will provide new
constraints on galaxy bias models. The anisotropic shear profile around close
pairs of galaxies is a prediction of cold dark matter models and may be
difficult to reconcile with alternative theories of gravity without dark
matter.

Washington photometry. The globular cluster luminosity function can be followed
roughly 1 mag beyond the turn-over magnitude. This corresponds to a distance
modulus of m-M=31.24+-0.17, 0.4 mag larger than the distance determined from
surface brightness fluctuations. The high specific frequency is confirmed, yet
the exact value remains uncertain because of the uncertain distance: it varies
between 5.6+-1.2 and 8.9+-1.2. The globular cluster system has a clearly
bimodal color distribution. The color peak positions show no radial dependence
and are in good agreement with the values found for other galaxies studied in
the same filter system. However, a luminosity dependence is found: brighter
clusters with an ``intermediate'' color exist. The clusters exhibit a shallow
radial distribution within 7'.Within the same radial interval, the galaxy light
has a distinctly steeper profile. Because of the difference in the cluster and
light distribution the specific frequency increases considerably with radius.
At 7' and 9' the density profiles of the red and blue clusters, respectively,
change strongly which indicates that we reach the outer rim of the cluster
system at approximately 11'. This feature is seen for the first time in a
globular cluster system. While the radial distribution of the cluster and field
populations are rather different, this is not true for the ellipticity of the
system: the elongation as well as the position angle of the cluster system
agree well with the galaxy light. We compare the radial distribution of
globular clusters with the light profiles for a sample of elliptical galaxies.
The difference observed in NGC 4636 is typical of an elliptical galaxy of this
luminosity.

Under the global regularity requirement, such configurations (i) have always an

alternating sign and (iii) V(\phi) should satisfy a certain fine-tuning type
equality. Thus a thick brane with any admissible V(\phi) is a regularized
version of the RS2 brane immersed in the AdS_5 bulk. The thin brane limit is
realized in a universal manner by including an arbitrary thick brane model in a
one-parameter family, where the parameter ""a"" is associated with brane
thickness; the asymptotic value of V(\phi) (related to \Lambda_5, the effective
cosmological constant) remains a-independent. The problem of ordinary matter
confinement on the brane is discussed for a test scalar field. Its
stress-energy tensor is found to diverge at the AdS horizon for both thin and
thick branes, making a serious problem for this class of brane world models.

structure of the coset subalgebras constructed and show that they are all
generated by two conformal vectors of central charge 1/2. We also study the
representation theory of these coset subalgebras and show that the product of
two Miyamoto involutions is in the desired conjugacy class of the Monster
simple group if a coset subalgebra U is actually contained in the Moonshine
VOA. The existence of U inside the Moonshine VOA for the cases of 1A, 2A, 2B
and 4A is also established. Moreover, the cases for 3A, 5A and 3C are
discussed.

hereditary category under a well-behaved autoequivalence is canonically
triangulated. This answers a question by A. Buan, R. Marsh and I. Reiten which
appeared in their study with M. Reineke and G. Todorov of the link between
tilting theory and cluster algebras (closely related to work by
Caldero-Chapoton-Schiffler) and a question by H. Asashiba about orbit
categories. We observe that the resulting triangulated orbit categories provide
many easy examples of triangulated categories with the Calabi-Yau property.
These include the category of projective modules over a preprojective algebra
of generalized Dynkin type in the sense of Happel-Preiser-Ringel, whose
triangulated structure goes back to Auslander-Reiten's work on the
representation-theoretic approach to rational singularities.

measures of the nuclear stopping power are found sensitive to the magnitude but
they are ambiguous for determining the isospin dependence of the in-medium NN
cross sections. It is shown that isospin tracers, such as the neutron/proton
ratio of free nucleons, at backward rapidities/angles in nuclear reactions
induced by radioactive beams in inverse kinematics is a sensitive probe of the
isospin dependence of the in-medium NN cross sections. At forward
rapidities/angles, on the other hand, they are more sensitive to the density
dependence of the symmetry energy. Measurements of the rapidity/angular
dependence of the isospin transport in nuclear reactions will enable a better
understanding of the isospin dependence of in-medium nuclear effective
interactions.

Monte Carlo simulations of bit-strings incorporating the birth, maturity, and
death of every individual. For our bit-string model, depending on parameters
either one language comprises the majority of speakers (dominance), or the
population splits into many languages having in order of magnitude the same
number of speakers (fragmentation); in the latter case the size distribution is
log-normal, with upward deviations for small sizes, just as in reality for
human languages. On a lattice two different dominating languages can coexist in
neighbouring regions, without being favoured or disfavoured by different
status. We deal with modifications and competition for existing languages, not
with the evolution or learning of one language.

the spectral behavior of classical Kolmogorov fluid turbulence over an inertial
subrange and departures from this at short wavelengths, where energy should be
dissipated. Here we present the first measurements of the electric field
fluctuation spectrum over the inertial and dissipative wavenumber ranges in a
$\beta \gtrsim 1$ plasma. The $k^{-5/3}$ inertial subrange is observed and
agrees strikingly with the magnetic fluctuation spectrum; the wave phase speed
in this regime is shown to be consistent with the Alfv\'en speed. At smaller
wavelengths $k \rho_i \geq 1$ the electric spectrum is softer and is consistent
with the expected dispersion relation of short-wavelength kinetic Alfv\'en
waves. Kinetic Alfv\'en waves damp on the solar wind ions and electrons and may
act to isotropize them. This effect may explain the fluid-like nature of the
solar wind.
