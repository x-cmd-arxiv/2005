revisit various scenarios for the generation of second-order non-gaussianity in

unified notation and focusing on the normalisation f_{NL} of the bispectrum.
When the classical curvature perturbation first appears a few Hubble times
after horizon exit, |f_{NL}| is much less than 1 and is, therefore, negligible.
Thereafter \zeta (and hence f_{NL}) is conserved as long as the pressure is a
unique function of energy density (adiabatic pressure). Non-adiabatic pressure
comes presumably only from the effect of fields, other than the one pointing
along the inflationary trajectory, which are light during inflation (`light
non-inflaton fields'). During single-component inflation f_{NL} is constant,
but multi-component inflation might generate |f_{NL}| \sim 1 or bigger.
Preheating can affect f_{NL} only in atypical scenarios where it involves light
non-inflaton fields. The curvaton scenario typically gives f_{NL} \ll -1 or
f_{NL} = +5/4. The inhomogeneous reheating scenario can give a wide range of
values for f_{NL}. Unless there is a detection, observation can eventually
provide a limit |f_{NL}| \lsim 1, at which level it will be crucial to
calculate the precise observational limit using second order theory.

considerable number of resonances associated to the Kuiper Belt dynamics and

resonant periodic orbits and their stability. Stable periodic orbits are
surrounded by regular librations in phase space and in such domains the capture
of trans-Neptunian object is possible. All the periodic orbits found are
symmetric and there is evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones only in
few cases. In the present work first, second and third order resonances are
under consideration. In the planar circular case we found that most of the
periodic orbits are stable. The families of periodic orbits are temporarily
interrupted by collisions but they continue up to relatively large values of
the Jacobi constant and highly eccentric regular motion exists for all cases.
In the elliptic problem and for a particular eccentricity value of the primary
bodies the periodic orbits are isolated. The corresponding families, where they
belong to, bifurcate from specific periodic orbits of the circular problem and
seem to continue up to the rectilinear problem. Both stable and unstable orbits
are obtained for each case. In the elliptic problem the unstable orbits found
are associated with narrow chaotic domains in phase space. The evolution of the
orbits, which are located in such chaotic domains, seems to be practically
regular and bounded for long time intervals.

operation. The instrument employs an all-refractive fiber spectrograph, built
with CaF2 optics, to provide good transmission and high image quality over the
entire nominal wavelength range. A set of user-selectable reflective gratings
provides low to medium spectral resolution in first order of approx. 1.5, 3.2,

standard integral field unit (IFU) uses a 16x16 element lens array, which
provides seeing-limited sampling in a relatively small field-of-view (FOV) in
one of three magnifications (8x8, 12x12, or 16x16 arcsec^2, respectively), a
recently retrofitted bare fiber bundle IFU (PPak) expands the FOV to a
hexagonal area with a footprint of 65x74 arcsec^2. Other special features
include a cryogenic CCD camera for field acquisition and guiding, a nod-shuffle
mode for beam switching and improved sky background subtraction, and a scanning
Fabry-Perot etalon in combination with the standard IFU (PYTHEAS mode). PMAS

100-1000 years), as long as the damping is determined by the bulk viscosity.

equilibrium for a self-gravitating, magnetized fluid body, under the only
hypotheses that (a) the equation of state is isothermal, (b) the configuration
is scale-free, and (c) the body is electrically neutral. All physical variables
are represented as series of scalar and vector spherical harmonics of degree l
and order m, and the equilibrium equations are reduced to a set of coupled
quadratic algebraic equations for the expansion coefficients of the density and
the magnetic vector potential. The method is general, and allows to recover
previously known hydrostatic and magnetostatic solutions possessing axial
symmetry. A linear perturbation analysis of the equations in spectral form show
that these basic axisymmetric states, considered as a continuos sequence with
the relative amount of magnetic support as control parameter, have in general
no neighboring nonaxisymmetric equilibria. This result lends credence to a
conjecture originally made by H. Grad and extends early results obtained by E.
Parker to the case of self-gravitating magnetized bodies. The only allowed
bifurcations of this sequence of axisymmetric equilibria are represented by
distortions with dipole-like angular dependence (l=1) that can be continued
into the nonlinear regime. These new configurations are either (i) azimuthally
asymmetric (m=+-1) or (ii) azimuthally symmetric but without reflection
symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane (m=0). To the extent that
interstellar clouds can be represented as isolated magnetostatic equilibria,
the results of this study suggest that the observed triaxial shapes of
molecular cloud cores can be interpreted in terms of weakly damped Alfven
oscillations about an equilibrium state.

coeval, within empirical and theoretical uncertainties, to the bulk of Omega

tracers compared to the old stellar disk morphology, can be radically
different. Galaxies which appear multi-armed and even flocculent in the optical
may show significant Grand-Design spirals in the near-infrared. Furthermore,
the optically determined Hubble classification scheme does not provide a sound
way of classifying dust-penetrated stellar disks: spiral arm pitch angles (when
measured in the near-infrared) do not correlate with Hubble type. The
dust--penetrated classification scheme of Block & Puerari provides an
alternative classification based on near-infrared morphology, and which is thus
more closely linked to the dominant stellar mass component. Here we present
near--infrared K band images of 14 galaxies, on which we have performed a
Fourier analysis of the spiral structure in order to determine their
near-infrared pitch angles and dust--penetrated arm classes. We have also used
the rotation curve data of Mathewson et al. to calculate the rates of shear in
the stellar disks of these galaxies. We find a correlation between
near-infrared pitch angle and rate of shear: galaxies with wide open arms (the
$\gamma$ class) are found to have rising rotation curves, while those with
falling rotation curves belong to the tightly wound $\alpha$ bin. The major
determinant of near-infrared spiral arm pitch angle is the distribution of
matter within the galaxy concerned. The correlation reported in this study
provides the physical basis underpinning spiral arm classes in the
dust-penetrated regime and underscores earlier spectroscopic findings by
Burstein and Rubin that Hubble type and mass distributions are unrelated.

required are few-nucleon reaction cross sections. The nucleosynthesis of
heavier elements involves a variety of proton-, alpha-, neutron-, and
photon-induced reactions, coupled with radioactive decay. The advent of
radioactive ion beam facilities has opened an important new avenue for studying
these processes, as many involve radioactive species. Nuclear physics also

studied in the context of general relativity. Despite their appeal, these so
called emergent models suffer from a number of limitations. These include the
fact that they rely on an initial Einstein static state to describe the past
eternal phase of the universe. Given the instability of such a state within the
context of general relativity, this amounts to a very severe fine tuning. Also
in order to be able to study the dynamics of the universe within the context of
general relativity, they set the initial conditions for the universe in the
classical phase. Here we study the existence and stability of such models in
the context of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that both these limitations can
be partially remedied, once semi-classical effects are taken into account. An
important consequence of these effects is to give rise to a static solution
(not present in GR), which dynamically is a centre equilibrium point and
located in the more natural semi-classical regime. This allows the construction
of emergent models in which the universe oscillates indefinitely about such an
initial static state. We construct an explicit emergent model of this type, in
which a non-singular past eternal oscillating universe enters a phase where the
symmetry of the oscillations is broken, leading to an emergent inflationary
epoch, while satisfying all observational and semi-classical constraints. We
also discuss emergent models in which the universe possesses both early- and
late-time accelerating phases.

primordial background of gravitational waves from inflation or by second-order

that the internal shocks are created in the reconnection jet and that they are
possible sites of particle acceleration. We examine how magnetic reconnection
creates the multiple shocks by performing two-dimensional resistive
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this paper, we use a very small grid to
resolve the diffusion region. As a result, we find that the current sheet
becomes thin due to the tearing instability, and it collapses to a Sweet-Parker
sheet. The thin sheet becomes unstable to the secondary tearing instability.
Fast reconnection starts by the onset of anomalous resistivity immediately
after the secondary tearing instability. During the bursty, time-dependent
magnetic reconnection, the secondary tearing instability continues in the
diffusion region where the anomalous resistivity is enhanced. As a result, many
weak shocks are created in the reconnection jet. This situation produces
turbulent reconnection. We suggest that multiple fast shocks are created in the
jet and that the energetic electrons can be accelerated by these shocks.

prevents the gas temperature to fall below T_CMB, although this hardly alters
the cloud thermal evolution in low-metallicity gas. From the derived
temperature evolution, we assess cloud/core fragmentation as a function of
metallicity from linear perturbation theory, which requires that the core
elongation E := (b-a)/a > E_NL ~ 1, where a (b) is the short (long) core axis
length. The fragment mass is given by the thermal Jeans mass at E = E_NL. Given
these assumptions and the initial (gaussian) distribution of E we compute the
fragment mass distribution as a function of metallicity. We find that: (i) For
Z=0, all fragments are very massive, > 10^{3}M_sun, consistently with previous
studies; (ii) for Z>10^{-6} Z_sun a few clumps go through an additional high
density (> 10^{10} cm^{-3}) fragmentation phase driven by dust-cooling, leading
to low-mass fragments; (iii) The mass fraction in low-mass fragments is
initially very small, but at Z ~ 10^{-5}Z_sun it becomes dominant and continues

approximately kHz frequencies (stronger field, ~ 2-10 stellar radii from the

produce the observed X-ray spectrum. In addition, we show that the observed 2:3

The degree of density enhancement achieved by the instability is too low to
make dense interstellar clouds. The time and the length scales of the
instability are significantly longer and larger than the estimated formation
time and the observed mean separation of the GMCs, respectively. This paper
examines whether a replacement of the driving agent from the external to the
self gravity might remove these obstacles by activating the gravitational
instability in the Galactic ISM disk. The self gravity can suppress the
convective motions, and a cooperative action of the Jeans and the Parker
instabilities can remove all the obstacles confronting the classical version of
the Parker instability. The mass and mean separation of the structures
resulting from the odd-parity undular mode solution are shown to agree better
with the HI superclouds than with the GMCs. We briefly discuss how inclusions

quasar photometric variations (peak-to-peak amplitude and time-scale of the
variations) and on the accuracy of the individual photometric points. The
output of the simulations is the (statistical) relative error made on the time
delay measurement, as a function of 1- the object visibility over the year, 2-
the temporal sampling of the light curves and 3- the time delay. Also
investigated is the effect of long term microlensing variations which must be
below the 5 % level (either intrinsically or by subtraction) if the goal is to
measure time delays with an accuracy of 1-2 %. However, while microlensing
increases the random error on the time delay, it does not significantly
increase the systematic error, which is always a factor 5 to 10 smaller than

voltages and duty-cycles. At room temperature, the bias stress has two
components: a fast reversible component and a slow irreversible component. We
hypothesize that the irreversible component is due to charge trapping in the
disordered areas of the semiconductor film. At low duty-cycle (<2%), the fast
bias stress component is reversed during the off-part of the cycle therefore
the observed VT shift in only caused by irreversible trapping. Irreversible
trapping follows power-law kinetics with a time exponent approximately equal to

approximation if the zero point energy is small compared to the energy gain due
to the distortion, which is true for large exchange interactions compared to
the phonons energy ($J\gg\hbar\omega$). In the opposite limit, one can
integrate out the phonon degrees of freedom and get an effective spin

explicit the crossover between the classical and quantum regimes. We then

shown to follow from the singularity theorems of General relativity. Whether
the entropy at such infinite proper-time objects can be other than zero has
also been a longstanding subject of research. Currently the property most
commonly chosen to calculate their entropy is a multiple of the surface area of
the event horizon and usually gives non-zero entropy values. Though popular,
this choice still leaves some substantial questions unanswered hence the
motivation for alternative methods for entropy derivation. Here, we use a
different property, the proper-time at singularities based on the General
relativity predicted behavior of clocks, to derive their entropy. We find,
firstly within statistical and thermodynamic principles, secondly when this
property is taken into account in the Bekenstein-Hawking formula and thirdly
illustrating with a natural analogue, that the entropy of black holes and all

based on three dynamic gravitational fields and succeeds in explaining a large
part of extragalactic and gravitational lensing phenomenology without invoking
dark matter. In this work we consider the strong gravity regime of TeVeS. We
study spherically symmetric, static and vacuum spacetimes relevant for a
non-rotating black hole or the exterior of a star. Two branches of solutions
are identified: in the first the vector field is aligned with the time

observational determinations of it (for the choice of the free function $F$ of

derive analytic expressions for the physical metric and discuss their

that they violate causality (since they allow for superluminal propagation of

dimensional orbifold model (on S1/Z2) where the Wilson line phase is identified
with the Higgs field (gauge-Higgs unification). Interestingly enough, an
estimate of the leading higher-loop ``daisy'' (or ``ring'') diagram
contributions to the effective potential in a simple five dimensional model,
seems to suggest that the electroweak phase transition can be studied in
perturbation theory even for Higgs masses above the current experimental limit
of 114 GeV. The transition is still of first order for such values of the Higgs
mass. If large localized gauge kinetic terms are present, the transition might
be strong enough to give baryogenesis at the electroweak transition.

identify the phase transition with the Horowitz-Polchinski point where the
black hole horizon size becomes comparable to the string scale. The appearance
of the Hagedorn divergence of thermal AdS is due to the merger of saddle points

be described in terms of a cusp (A_3) catastrophe and divergences at the

singularities similar to those of the nonplanar sector in noncommutative gauge
theories. We further isolate the contributions from each of the massless modes.
We interpret these results as the manifestation of open/closed string duality,
where the IR behaviour of the boundary noncommutative gauge theory is
reconstructed from the bulk theory of closed strings.

diameter of random graphs with an arbitrary i.i.d. degree sequence. We study
these properties primarily, but not exclusively, when the tail of the degree
distribution is regularly varying with exponent $1-\tau$. There are three
distinct cases: (i) $\tau>3$, where the degrees have finite variance, (ii)
$\tau\in (2,3)$, where the degrees have infinite variance, but finite mean, and
(iii) $\tau\in (1,2)$, where the degrees have infinite mean. These random
graphs can serve as models for complex networks where degree power laws are

  Our results are twofold. First, we give a criterion when there exists a
unique largest connected component of size proportional to the size of the

establish a phase transition for the diameter when $\tau \in (2,3)$. Indeed, we
show that for $\tau>2$ and when nodes with degree 2 are present with positive
probability, the diameter of the random graph is, with high probability,
bounded below by a constant times the logarithm of the size of the graph. On

of the insider's and the less informed trader's expected logarithmic utility is
described in terms of the information drift, that is, the drift one has to
eliminate in order to perceive the price dynamics as a martingale from the
insider's perspective. On the one hand, we describe the information drift in a
very general setting by natural quantities expressing the probabilistic better
informed view of the world. This, on the other hand, allows us to identify the
additional utility by entropy related quantities known from information theory.
In particular, in a complete market in which the insider has some fixed
additional information during the entire trading interval, its utility
increment can be represented by the Shannon information of his extra knowledge.
For general markets, and in some particular examples, we provide estimates of
maximal utility by information inequalities.

progressions of length 4 in A. We give a comprehensive study of the U^3(G)
norm, obtaining a reasonably complete description of functions f : G -> C for
which ||f||_{U^3} is large and providing links to recent results of Host, Kra
and Ziegler in ergodic theory.
  As an application we generalise a result of Gowers on Szemeredi's theorem.
Writing r_4(G) for the size of the largest set A not containing four distinct
elements in arithmetic progression, we show that r_4(G) << |G|(loglog|G|)^{-c}
for some absolute constant c.
  In future papers we will develop these ideas further, obtaining an asymptotic
for the number of 4-term progressions p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < p_4 < N of primes as
well as superior bounds for r_4(G).

recovered classes of people (``SEIJR'') to extract average properties and rate
constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario
(Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions
are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current
effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for
Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto,
Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between
March 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\it significant} slowing in the number
of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic
rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best
estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto,
although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model.
It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission,
SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that
computed for some strains of influenza \cite{CC2}. Although it would not be
surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than ten per cent in some

understanding and modelling of the cell's system. Although a vast number of
models have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from
complex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical
compounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features
of the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).
  In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes
expression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This
approach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov
property of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene
expression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition
probability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry
(i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a
repeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but
different in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the
short-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we
succeed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed
distribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of
the power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients:
symmetry and the Markov property of dynamics. This approach may represent a
step forward toward an integrated image of the basic elements of the whole
cell.

feature is found in yeast and human organisms, it suggests that probably this
coupling is a common dynamical organizing property of all living systems. To
understand these observations, we propose a stochastic model which can explain
these collective fluctuations, and predict the scaling exponent. Interestingly,
our results indicate that the observed scaling law emerges from the

Phys. J. D 37, 283--290 (2006)","10.1140/epjd/e2005-00306-3",,"quant-ph",,"  Recently it has been proposed to construct quantum error-correcting codes
that embed a finite-dimensional Hilbert space in the infinite-dimensional
Hilbert space of a system described by continuous quantum variables [D.
Gottesman et al., Phys. Rev. A 64, 012310 (2001)]. The main difficulty of this
continuous variable encoding relies on the physical generation of the quantum
codewords. We show that ponderomotive interaction suffices to this end. As a
matter of fact, this kind of interaction between a system and a meter causes a
frequency change on the meter proportional to the position quadrature of the
system. Then, a phase measurement of the meter leaves the system in an
eigenstate of the stabilizer generators, provided that system and meter's
initial states are suitably prepared. Here we show how to implement this
interaction using trapped ions, and how the encoding can be performed on their
motional degrees of freedom. The robustness of the codewords with respect to
the various experimental imperfections is then analyzed.

  version of quant-ph/0501030",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In Bohm's version of the EPR gedanken experiment, the spin of the second
particle along any vector is minus the spin of the other particle along the
same vector. It seems that either the choice of vector along which one projects
the spin of the first particle influences at superluminal speed the state of
the second particle, or naive realism holds true i.e., the projections of the
spin of any EPR particle along all the vectors are determined before any
measurement occurs). Naive realism is negated by Bell's theory that originated
and is still most often presented as related to non-locality, a relation whose
necessity has recently been proven to be false. I advocate here that the
solution of the apparent paradox lies in the fact that the spin of the second
particle is determined along any vector, but not along all vectors. Such an
any-all distinction was already present in quantum mechanics, for instance in
the fact that the spin can be measured along any vector but not at once along
all vectors, as a result of the Uncertainty Principle. The time symmetry of the
any-all distinction defended here is in fact reminiscent of (and I claim, due
to) the time symmetry of the Uncertainty Principle described by Einstein,
Tolman, and Podolsky in 1931, in a paper entitled ``Knowledge of Past and
Future in Quantum Mechanics"" that is enough to negate naive realism and to hint
at the any-all distinction. A simple classical model is next built, which
captures aspects of the any-all distinction: the goal is of course not to have
a classical exact model, but to provide a caricature that might help some
people.

may be brought about by an interaction with another quantum system B. We will
prove that this is not just a possible, but a necessary consequence of
information transfer from A to B. We generalize this in order to explain why
coherences are normally not observed in macroscopic quantum systems. Finally,
we provide a quantitative insight into the balance between information gain and
state disturbance. We define the quality of an information transfer. For all
information transfers of a certain quality, we find a minimum amount of state
collapse. Along the way, we obtain generalizations of the Joint Measurement
Theorem and of the Heisenberg Principle.

quantum information, two results on the role of quantum information technology
in quantum feedback control are presented and two quantum feedback control
schemes, teleportation-based distant quantum feedback control and quantum
feedback control with quantum cloning, are proposed. In the first feedback
scheme, the output from the quantum system to be controlled is fed back into
the distant actuator via teleportation to alter the dynamics of system. The
result theoretically shows that it can accomplish some tasks such as distant
feedback quantum control that Markovian or Bayesian quantum feedback can't
complete. In the second feedback strategy, the design of quantum feedback
control algorithms is separated into a state recognition step, which gives
""on-off"" signal to the actuator through recognizing some copies from the
cloning machine, and a feedback (control) step using another copies of cloning
machine. A compromise between information acquisition and measurement
disturbance is established, and this strategy can perform some quantum control
tasks with coherent feedback.

parameter range when N=3. In both cases we use the reduction method for the
corresponding problem of mixed state discrimination, as introduced by Raynal et

for N=2. Finally, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
unambiguous comparison of mixed states to be possible.

of arbitrary dimension $D$ benefits from applying basic concepts from number
theory, since the set $\zdn$ associated to Bell diagonal states is a module
rather than a vector space. We find that a partition of $\zdn$ into divisor
classes characterizes the invariant properties of mixed Bell diagonal states
under local permutations. We construct a very general class of recursion
protocols by means of unitary operations implementing these local permutations.
We study these distillation protocols depending on whether we use twirling
operations in the intermediate steps or not, and we study them both
analitically and numerically with Monte Carlo methods. In the absence of
twirling operations, we construct extensions of the quantum privacy algorithms
valid for secure communications with qudits of any dimension $D$. When $D$ is a
prime number, we show that distillation protocols are optimal both
