case, the velocity dispersion - characterized by the spectrum fitting parameter
b - increases with the level of excitation, a phenomenon that has previously
been detected by the Copernicus and IMAPS observatories. In particular, we show
with 4 sigma confidence that for HD 192639 it is not possible to fit all J
levels with a single b value, and that higher b values are needed for the
higher levels. The amplitude of the line broadening, which can be as high as 10
km s^-1, makes explanations such as inhomogeneous spatial distribution
unlikely. We investigate a mechanism in which the broadening is due to the
molecules that are rotationally excited through the excess energy acquired
after their formation on a grain (H2-formation pumping). We show that different
dispersions would be a natural consequence of this mechanism. We note however
that such process would require a formation rate 10 times higher then what was
inferred from other observations. In view of the difficulty to account for the
velocity dispersion as thermal broadening (T would be around 10,000 K), we
conclude then that we are most certainly observing some highly turbulent warm
layer associated with the cold diffuse cloud. Embedded in a magnetic field, it
could be responsible for the high quantities of CH+ measured in the cold
neutral medium.

triggered by the ICM pressure. BVR images at 0.5"" resolution obtained with the

matching the HI morphology. Large dust plumes extend upward for ~1.5 kpc from
luminous young star clusters at the SE edge of the truncated gas disk. These

filaments with a position angle that matches the extraplanar radio continuum

apart yield an upper limit on its spin-down rate of dP/dt < 7E-14 s/s and no
evidence for binary orbital motion. The implied energy loss rate is dE/dt <
2E36 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength is B_p < 3E12 G, and spin-down age
is t > 24 kyr. The latter exceeds the remnant's estimated age, suggesting that
the pulsar was born spinning near its current period. The X-ray spectrum of PSR
J1852+0040 is best characterized by a blackbody model of temperature kT_BB =
0.44 +/- 0.03 keV, radius R_BB approx. 0.9 km, and L_bol = 3.7E33 ergs/s at d =
7.1 kpc. The sinusoidal light curve is modulated with a pulsed fraction of
>45%, suggestive of a small hot spot on the surface of the rotating neutron
star. The lack of a discernible pulsar wind nebula is consistent with an
interpretation of PSR J1852+0040 as a rotation-powered pulsar whose spin-down
luminosity falls below the empirical threshold for generating bright wind
nebulae, dE/dt_c approx. 4E36 ergs/s. The age discrepancy implies that its
dE/dt has always been below dE/dt_c, perhaps a distinguishing property of the
CCOs. Alternatively, the X-ray spectrum of PSR J1852+0040 suggests a
low-luminosity AXP, but the weak inferred B_p field is incompatible with a
magnetar theory of its X-ray luminosity. So far, we cannot exclude accretion
from a fall-back disk. The ordinary spin parameters discovered from PSR
J1852+0040 highlight the difficulty that existing theories of isolated neutron
stars have in explaining the high luminosities and temperatures of CCO thermal
X-ray spectra.

clusters follows the global shape inferred at low redshift quite well. This
result is consistent with the gravitational instability picture leading to self
similar structures for both the dark and baryonic matter. However, the mean
$f\_{\rm gas} in distant clusters shows some differences to local ones,
indicating a departure from strict scaling. This result is consistent with the
observed evolution in the luminosity-temperature relation. We quantitatively
investigate this departure from scaling laws. Within the local sample we used,
a moderate but clear variation of the amplitude of the gas mass fraction with
temperature is found, a trend that weakens in the outer regions. These
variations do not explain departure from scaling laws of our distant clusters.
An important implication of our results is that the gas fraction evolution, a
test of the cosmological parameters, can lead to biased values when applied at
radii smaller than the virial radius. From our $XMM$ clusters, the apparent gas
fraction at the virial radius is consistent with a non-evolving universal value
in a high matter density model and not with a concordance.

self-assembly there is still a lack of simple blocks made of ""solid matter""

While the resulting formulas appear to be just as hard for DPLL algorithms as
random 3-SAT formulas with no hidden assignment, they can be solved by WalkSAT
in only polynomial time. Here we propose a new method to cancel the attraction
to A, by choosing a clause with t > 0 literals satisfied by A with probability
proportional to q^t for some q < 1. By varying q, we can generate formulas
whose variables have no bias, i.e., which are equally likely to be true or
false; we can even cause the formula to ``deceptively'' point away from A. We
present theoretical and experimental results suggesting that these formulas are
exponentially hard both for DPLL algorithms and for incomplete algorithms such
as WalkSAT.

relies on the noncommutative extension of a zero-curvature condition satisfied
by algebra-valued gauge potentials dependent on the fields. This condition can
be expressed as noncommutative Leznov-Saveliev equations which make possible to
define the noncommutative generalizations as systems of second order
differential equations, with an infinite chain of conserved currents. The
actions corresponding to these field theories are also provided. The special
cases of GL(2) Liouville and $\widetilde{GL}(2)$ sinh/sine-Gordon are

(anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions it is possible to
obtain by dimensional reduction the equations of motion of the two-dimensional

of two coupled van der Pol oscillators, the characteristic frequencies differ
twice, and the parameters controlling generation in both oscillators undergo a
slow periodic counter-phase variation in time. In terms of stroboscopic
Poincar\'{e} section, the respective four-dimensional mapping has a hyperbolic
strange attractor of Smale - Williams type. Qualitative reasoning and
quantitative data of numerical computations are presented and discussed, e.g.
Lyapunov exponents and their parameter dependencies. A special test for
hyperbolicity based on statistical analysis of distributions of angles between
stable and unstable subspaces of a chaotic trajectory has been performed.
Perspectives of further comparative studies of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic
chaotic dynamics in physical aspect are outlined.

characterizing and modeling financial time series. A number of stylized facts
have been identified, and volatility clustering or the tendency toward
persistence has emerged as the central feature. In this paper we propose an
appropriately defined conditional probability as a new measure of volatility
clustering. We test this measure by applying it to different stock market data,
and we uncover a rich temporal structure in volatility fluctuations described
very well by a scaling relation. The scale factor used in the scaling provides
a direct measure of volatility clustering; such a measure may be used for
developing techniques for option pricing, risk management, and economic
forecasting. In addition, we present a stochastic volatility model that can
display many of the salient features exhibited by volatilities of empirical
financial time series, including the behavior of conditional probabilities that
we have deduced.

suggests that the Bolling-Allerod Interstadial, Younger Dryas stadial, and
subsequent Preboreal warming which occurred at the end of the last ice age were
characterized by temperatures that changed synchronously in various parts of
the world, implying that these climatic oscillations were produced by
significant changes in the Earth's energy balance. These globally coordinated
oscillations are not easily explained by ocean current mechanisms such as
bistable flipping of ocean deep-water production or regional temperature
changes involving the NW/SE migration of the North Atlantic polar front. They
also are not accounted for by Earth orbital changes in seasonality or by
increases in atmospheric CO-2 or CH-4. On the other hand, evidence of an
elevated cosmic ray flux and of a major interstellar dust incursion around
15,800 years B.P. suggest that a cosmic ray wind driven incursion of
interstellar dust and gas may have played a key role through its activation of
the Sun and alteration of light transmission through the interplanetary medium.

multiphase flows. Source terms are added to a two-dimensional standard lattice
Boltzmann equation (LBE) for multiphase flows such that the emergent dynamics
can be transformed into the axisymmetric cylindrical coordinate system. The
source terms are temporally and spatially dependent and represent the
axisymmetric contribution of the order parameter of fluid phases and inertial,
viscous and surface tension forces. A model which is effectively explicit and
second order is obtained. This is achieved by taking into account the discrete
lattice effects in the Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis, so that the
macroscopic axisymmetric mass and momentum equations for multiphase flows are
recovered self-consistently. The model is extended to incorporate reduced
compressibility effects. Axisymmetric equilibrium drop formation and
oscillations, breakup and formation of satellite droplets from viscous liquid
cylindrical jets through Rayleigh capillary instability and drop collisions are
presented. Comparisons of the computed results with available data show
satisfactory agreement.

optical tweezer experiments, show that RNA hairpins and the P5abc subdomain of
the group I intron unfold reversibly. We use coarse-grained Go-like models for
RNA hairpins to explore forced-unfolding over a broad range of temperatures. A
number of predictions that are amenable to experimental tests are made. At the
critical force the hairpin jumps between folded and unfolded conformations
without populating any discernible intermediates. The phase diagram in the
force-temperature (f,T) plane shows that the hairpin unfolds by an all-or-none
process. The cooperativity of the unfolding transition increases dramatically
at low temperatures. Free energy of stability, obtained from time averages of
mechanical unfolding trajectories, coincide with ensemble averages which
establishes ergodicity. The hopping time between the the native basin of
attraction (NBA) and the unfolded basin increases dramatically along the phase
boundary. Thermal unfolding is stochastic whereas mechanical unfolding occurs
in ""quantized steps"" with great variations in the step lengths. Refolding
times, upon force quench, from stretched states to the NBA is ""at least an
order of magnitude"" greater than folding times by temperature quench. Upon
force quench from stretched states the NBA is reached in at least three stages.
In the initial stages the mean end-to-end distance decreases nearly
continuously and only in the last stage there is a sudden transition to the
NBA. Because of the generality of the results we propose that similar behavior
should be observed in force quench refolding of proteins.
