giant flare (GF) ever detected from an SGR, with an (isotropic) energy release
$\sim 100$ times greater than the only two other known SGR GFs. It was followed
by a very bright, fading radio afterglow. Extensive follow-up radio
observations provided a wealth of information with unprecedented astrometric
precision, revealing the temporal evolution of the source size, along with
densely sampled light curves and spectra. Here we expand on our previous work
on this source, by explaining these observations within one self-consistent
dynamical model. In this scenario, the early radio emission is due to the
outflow ejected during the GF energizing a thin shell surrounding a
pre-existing cavity, where the observed steep temporal decay of the radio
emission seen beginning on day 9 is attributed to the adiabatic cooling of the
shocked shell. The shocked ejecta and external shell move outward together,
driving a forward shock into the ambient medium, and are eventually decelerated
by a reverse shock. As we show in Gelfand et al. (2005), the radio emission
from the shocked external medium naturally peaks when significant deceleration
occurs, and then decays relatively slowly. The dynamical modeling of the
collision between the ejecta and the external shell together with the observed
evolution of the source size (which is nicely reproduced in our model) suggest
that most of the energy in the outflow was in mildly relativistic material,
with an initial expansion velocity $v/c \lesssim 0.7d_{15}$, for a distance of
$15d_{15}$ kpc to SGR 1806-20. An initially highly relativistic outflow would
not have produced a long coasting phase at a mildly relativistic expansion
velocity, as was observed.

also bserved several point spread function (PSF) calibrators,
non-simultaneously because of the small field of view. The significant temporal
PSF variations on timescales of minutes inhibited a straightforward scaled PSF
removal from the quasar images. Characterising the degree of PSF concentration
by the radii encircling 20% and 80% of the total flux, respectively, we found
that even under very different observing conditions the r_20 vs. r_80 relation
varied coherently between individual short exposure images, delineating a
well-defined relation for point sources. Placing the quasar images on this
relation, we see indications that all three objects were resolved. We designed
a procedure to estimate the significance of this result, and to estimate host
galaxy parameters, by reproducing the statistical distribution of the
individual short exposure images. We find in all three cases evidence for a
luminous host galaxy, with a mean absolute magnitude of M_R = -27.0 and scale
lengths around ~ 4-12 kpc. Together with a rough estimate of the central black
hole masses obtained from C_iv line widths, the location of the objects on the

in cosmology. However, if the shot noise is large enough and the correlation
function/power spectrum conspires, the Gaussian approximation mis-estimates the
errors and their covariance significantly. The power spectrum, even for
initially Gaussian densities,acquires cross correlations which can be large,
while the change in the correlation function error matrix is diagonal except at
zero separation. Two and three dimensional power law correlation function and
power spectrum examples are given. These corrections appear to have a large
effect when applied to galaxy clusters, e.g. for SZ selected galaxy clusters in
2 dimensions. This can increase the error estimates for cosmological parameter
estimation and consequently affect survey strategies, as the corrections are
minimized for surveys which are deep and narrow rather than wide and shallow.
In addition, a rewriting of the error matrix for the power spectrum/correlation
function is given which eliminates most of the Bessel function dependence (in
two dimensions) and all of it (in three dimensions), which makes the
calculation of the error matrix more tractable. This applies even when the shot
noise is in the (usual) Gaussian limit.

undergoing polar magnetic burial is calculated. During accretion, the magnetic
field of a neutron star is compressed into a narrow belt at the magnetic
equator by material spreading equatorward from the polar cap. In turn, the
compressed field confines the accreted material in a polar mountain which is
misaligned with the rotation axis in general, producing gravitational waves.
The equilibrium hydromagnetic structure of the polar mountain, and its
associated mass quadrupole moment, are computed as functions of the accreted
mass, M_a, by solving a Grad-Shafranov boundary value problem. The orientation-
and polarization-averaged gravitational wave strain, h_c ~ 6e-24 for a 0.6 kHz
source at 1 kpc with M_a > 10^-5 M_Sun, exceeds previous estimates that failed
to treat equatorward spreading and flux freezing self-consistently. It is
concluded that an accreting millisecond pulsar emits a persistent, sinusoidal
gravitational wave signal at levels detectable, in principle, by long baseline
interferometers after phase-coherent integration, provided that the polar
mountain is hydromagnetically stable. Magnetic burial also reduces the magnetic
dipole moment, mu, monotonically, implying a novel, observationally testable
scaling h_c(mu). The implications for the rotational evolution of (accreting)
X-ray and (isolated) radio millisecond pulsars are explored.

amplitude of the oscillations is assumed large enough to cause creation of
upgoing and downgoing pairs at different phases of the oscillation. With a
charge-starved initial condition, we find that the oscillations result in
bursts of pair creation in which the pair density rises exponentially with
time. The pair density saturates at $N_\pm\simeq E_{0}^2/(8\pi
m_ec^2\Gamma_{\rm thr})$, where $E_0$ is the parallel electric field in the
charge-starved initial state, and $\Gamma_{\rm thr}$ is the Lorentz factor for
effec tive pair creation. The frequency of oscillations following the pair
creation burst is given roughly by $\omega_{\rm osc}=eE_0/(8m_ec\Gamma_{\rm

creation rate balances the loss rate due to pairs escaping the magnetosphere.

of the circumstellar dust around the six systems is that the dust resides in a

an anisotropic Jahn-Teller-type interaction and 3D Coulomb repulsion are
investigated. In the mean-field approximation without Coulomb interaction, the
system displays a phase transition of first order. When the long range Coulomb
interaction is included, Monte Carlo simulations show that the system displays
very diverse mesoscopic textures, ranging from spatially disordered pairs to
ordered arrays of stripes, or charged clusters, depending only on the ratio of
the two interactions (and the particle density). Remarkably, charged objects
with even number of particles are more stable than with odd number of
particles. We suggest that the diverse functional behaviour - including
superconductivity - observed in oxides can be thought to arise from the
self-organization of this type.

phonons using the extended Hubbard-Holstein model in which both, the
electron-phonon interaction and the on-site Coulomb repulsion are considered to
be strong. The Lang-Firsov canonical transformation allows to obtain mobile
polarons for which a new diagram technique and generalized Wick's theorem is
used. This allows to handle the Coulomb repulsion between the electrons emerged
into a sea of phonon fields (\textit{phonon clouds}). The physics of emission
and absorption of the collective phonon-field mode by the polarons is discussed
in detail. Moreover, we have investigated the different behavior of optical and
acoustical phonon clouds when propagating through the lattice. In the
strong-coupling limit of the electron-phonon interaction, and in the normal as
well as in the superconducting phase, chronological thermodynamical averages of
products of acoustical phonon-cloud operators can be expressed by one-cloud
operator averages. While the normal one-cloud propagator has the form of a
Lorentzian, the anomalous one is of Gaussian form and considerably smaller.
Therefore, the anomalous electron Green's functions can be considered to be
more important than corresponding polarons functions, i.e., pairing of
electrons without phonon-clouds is easier to achieve than pairing of polarons
with such clouds.

anomalies are Hochschild coboundaries of regularized trace cochains on a fixed

pseudodifferential operator with positive order and positive scalar leading

pseudodifferential operators associated with a smooth fibration of manifolds.
They correspond to covariant derivatives (and possibly their curvature) of
smooth families of regularized trace cochains, the weight being here an
elliptic operator valued form on the base manifold. Both types of discrepancies
can be expressed as finite linear combinations of Wodzicki residues.We apply
the formulae obtained in the family setting to build Chern-Weil type weighted
trace cochains on one hand, and on the other hand, to show that choosing the
curvature of a Bismut-Quillen type super connection as a weight, provides
covariantly closed weighted trace cochains in which case the geometric

of classical homotopy theory of topological spaces. In this paper we go as far
as introducing the homotopy groups and establishing their basic properties. We
also develop a Galois theory of covering spaces for a (locally connected
semilocally 1-connected) topological stack. Built into the Galois theory is a
method for determining the stacky structure (i.e., inertia groups) of covering
stacks. As a consequence, we get for free a characterization of topological
stacks that are quotients of topological spaces by discrete group actions. For
example, this give a handy characterization of good orbifolds.
  Orbifolds, graphs of groups, and complexes of groups are examples of
topological (Deligne-Mumford) stacks. We also show that any algebraic stack (of
finite type over $\mathbb{C}$) gives rise to a topological stack. We also prove
a Riemann Existence Theorem for stacks. In particular, the algebraic
fundamental group of an algebraic stack over $\mathbb{C}$ is isomorphic to the
profinite completion of the fundamental group of its underlying topological
stack.

physical applications. The microcosm physics needs expansion of the class of
possible geometries appropriate for the role of space-time geometry. In the
framework of the non-Riemannian geometry one can construct the space-time
geometry, where the motion of free particles is primordially stochastic, and
this stochasticity depends on the particle mass. At the same time the geometry
in itself is not stochastic in the sense that the space-time intervals are
deterministic. Principles of quantum mechanics can be deduced from such a
space-time geometry. The crisis situation in geometry appears to be connected
with some preconceptions concerning the foundation of the geometry. The
preconceptions as well as the crisis generated by them are not purely
scientific phenomena. The human factor (social aspect) is rather strong in the
crisis phenomena. The preconceptions and the human factor appear to be so
strong, that usual logical arguments are not perceived, and the usual formal
mathematical language appears to be inappropriate for perception of an analysis

attached with ADP and attached without nucleotide) and alternatively with a
5-state cycle (where the power stroke is not tightly coupled to the phosphate
release). In each state the lever arm leaves the head at a different, but
fixed, angle. The lever arm itself is described as an elastic rod. The chemical
cycles of both heads are coordinated exclusively by the mechanical connection
between the two lever arms. The model explains head coordination by showing
that the lead head only binds to actin after the power stroke in the trail head
and that it only undergoes its power stroke after the trail head unbinds from
actin. Both models (4- and 5-state) reproduce the observed hand-over-hand
motion and fit the measured force-velocity relations. The main difference
between the two models concerns the load dependence of the run length, which is
much weaker in the 5-state model. We show how systematic processivity
measurement under varying conditions could be used to distinguish between both
models and to determine the kinetic parameters.

relatively small (80 to 120 residues) protein binding modules central in the

recognized through specific amino-acids in their carboxyl end. Binding is
associated with a deformation of the PDZ native structure and is responsible
for dynamical changes in regions not in direct contact with the target. We
investigate how this deformation is related to the harmonic dynamics of the PDZ

by the concerted movements of different secondary structures, is involved in
the binding process. Our results suggest that even minimal structural changes
are responsible of communication between distant regions of the protein, in

characterize the relation between function and dynamics of proteins, and to

  Schwarzschild black holes","Major revision with a new figure",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  We found that the Wigner rotation of a particle with spin 1/2, which is
unitary in Minkowski spacetime, becomes non-unitary as the particle is falling
onto the black hole. This implies that, from the quantum information processing
point of view, any quantum information encoded in spins will be dissipated near
the black hole. The gravitational field around the black hole thus acts like a
dissipative quantum channel, especially the bit flip channel.

of the source is much shorter than that of previous experiments using random
scattered light from a laser. A two-pinhole mask was used as object, and the
corresponding thin lens equation was well satisfied. Since thermal light
sources are easier to obtain and measure than entangled light it is conceivable
that they may be used in special imaging applications.

under simultaneous SU(2) transformations in both subsystems. Previous results
on the behavior of such states under partial transposition are substantially
extended. The spectrum of the partial transpose of a given SU(2)-invariant
density matrix $\rho$ is entirely determined by the diagonal elements of $\rho$
in a basis of tensor-product states of both spins with respect to a common
quantization axis. We construct a set of operators which act as entanglement
witnesses on SU(2)-invariant states. A sufficient criterion for $\rho$ having a
negative partial transpose is derived in terms of a simple spin correlator. The
same condition is a necessary criterion for the partial transpose to have the
maximum number of negative eigenvalues. Moreover, we derive a series of sum
rules which uniquely determine the eigenvalues of the partial transpose in
terms of a system of linear equations. Finally we compare our findings with
other entanglement criteria including the reduction criterion, the majorization
criterion, and the recently proposed local uncertainty relations.

matrix diagonal elements [S.M. Barnett and S. Stenholm, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 64},

situations in which the symmetrically ordered characteristic function is
perfectly well defined while the corresponding density matrix loses positivity.
Therefore nonphysical situations may not show up in the characteristic
function. As a consequence, the characteristic function cannot be considered an
{\it alternative complete} description of the non-Lindblad dynamics.

gates which process qubits. The one-way quantum computer proposed by
Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding
of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think
about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a
highly-entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation
proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward
of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement a one-way
quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer the order and
choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have
experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization
state of four photons. We fully characterize the quantum state by implementing
the first experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster
state we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a
universal set of one- and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of
Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is
ideally suited for such tasks.
