the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 from five ~170 ks observations with the Chandra
high energy gratings. Monitoring was conducted over an interval of ~125 days in
2001. The combined data constitute the highest signal-to-noise Fe K spectrum
having the best velocity resolution in the Fe K band to date (FWHM ~1860 km/s).
The data show a resolved Fe K line core with a center energy of 6.397 +/- 0.003
keV, consistent with an origin in neutral or lowly ionized Fe, located between
the BLR and NLR, as found by Kaspi et al. (2002). We also find that excess flux
around the base of the Fe K line core can be modeled with either a Compton
scattering ``shoulder'' or an emission line from a relativistic accretion disk,
having an inclination angle of 11 degrees or less. This disk line model is as
good as a Compton-shoulder model for the base of the Fe K line core. In the
latter model, the column density is 7.5 [+2.7,-0.6] x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, which
corresponds to a Thomson optical depth of ~0.60. An intrinsic width of 1500
[+460,-340] km/s FWHM is still required in this model. Moreover, more
complicated scenarios involving both a Compton-shoulder and a disk line cannot
be ruled out. We confirm an absorption feature due to He-like Fe (FWHM = 6405
[+5020,-2670] km/s), found in previous studies.

  Journal","Astron.J.130:280-294,2005","10.1086/430747",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop a phenomenological theory that aims to account for the origin of
the large eccentricities of extrasolar planets and that of the small
eccentricities in the solar system, the preference for apsidal alignment in
non-resonant multiplanet systems, and the origin of the similarities in the
eccentricity distribution of extra-solar planets and that of spectroscopic
binary stars. We show that if a physical process is weakly dependent on the
local dynamics of the companion and imparts a small relative acceleration to
the star-companion system, the eccentricity of the companion's orbit is excited
to large values depending on the direction and duration of acceleration. A
natural candidate for such processes are asymmetric stellar jets and star-disk
winds. When the acceleration originates from a precessing jet, large
eccentricities can be excited by the resonance of the jet's precession
frequency with the induced acceleration's excitation frequency even for nearly
perpendicular jets. Precession also reduces the eccentricity amplitude far
inside the resonance radius. The acceleration's strength is best constrained in
multiplanet systems because of the companions' mutual gravitational
perturbations, while the acceleration's duration is bounded by the condition
that the residual velocity imparted to the star is smaller than the stellar
velocity dispersion in the Galaxy. In the outer parts of the star-companion
system where the acceleration excitation time is comparable to or smaller than
the orbital period, significant radial migration takes place which may have
important consequences for the dynamics of the minor body populations in the
solar system. The theory is illustrated with the $\upsilon$ Andromedae binary
system.

flattens to ~M^{<0.3} above ~4x10^{13} M_sun. The total luminosity of galaxies
in the halo, however, continues to grow as a power-law ~M^{0.8-0.9}. Starting
from the hypothesis that the central galaxies grow by merging (""galactic

luminosities as a consequence of the accretion of satellite galaxies. The
luminosity-mass relation flattens when the time scale on which dynamical
friction induces orbital decay in the satellite galaxies exceeds the age of the
dark matter halo. Then, the growth of the central galaxy is suppressed as it
can cannibalize only the rare, massive satellite galaxies. The model takes the
dependence of the total luminosity of galaxies in a halo on its mass and the
global galaxy luminosity function as input, and reproduces the observed central
galaxy luminosity-mass relation over three decades in halo mass,

how the fraction of total mass that has condensed into stars is distributed

optical and near-infrared photometry and total masses from maximum rotational
velocities and disk scale lengths, utilizing a range of model relationships
derived analytically and from simulations. We find that the stellar/total mass
distribution and stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation for z > 0.7 disks is
similar to that at lower redshift, suggesting that baryonic mass is accreted by

abundances in the envelopes around a large sample of 18 low-mass pre- and
protostellar objects. It focuses on typical grain mantle products and organic
molecules, including H2CO, CH3OH and CH3CN. With a few exceptions, all H2CO
lines can be fit by constant abundances of 7e(-11)-8e(-9) throughout the
envelopes if ortho- and para lines are considered independently. The current
observational dataset does not require a large H2CO abundance enhancement in
the inner warm regions, but this can also not be ruled out. Through comparison
of the H2CO abundances of the entire sample, the H2CO ortho-para ratio is
constrained to be 1.6+/-0.3 consistent with thermalization on grains at
temperatures of 10-15 K. The H2CO abundances can be related to the empirical
chemical network established on the basis of our previously reported survey of
other species and is found to be closely correlated with that of the
nitrogen-bearing molecules. These correlations reflect the freeze-out of
molecules at low temperatures and high densities. An improved fit to the data
is obtained with a `drop' abundance structure in which the abundance decrease
when the temperature is lower than the evaporation temperature and the density
high enough so that the timescale for depletion is less than the lifetime of
the core. The derived abundance structures for CH3OH are consistent with a
scenario where CH3OH probes the action of compact outflows on the envelopes,
which is further supported by comparison to high frequency, high excitation CS
J=10-9 and HDO line profiles. The extent to which the outflow dominates the
abundance enhancements compared with the passively heated inner envelope
depends on the filling factors of the two components in the observing beam.

enlarge the corotation radius and thus make it possible for accreting material
to reach the surface of the NS in the low accretion rate case. Thus the
generation of the absorption features should be similar to the case of
accreting pulsars. The close equality of the energy loss by fast cooling of the
postsupernova neutron star and the energy dissipation needed for a wide binary
evolving to an ultra-compact binary demonstrates that the ultra-compact binary
may be formed in 10-100yr after the second supernova explosion. Moreover, the
ultra-compact binary hypothesis can well explain the the absence of optical

Once we select an ``equation of state'' linking the energy density ($\mu$) and
pressure ($p$) of the DE fluid, as well as a free function governing the radial
dependence, the models become fully determinate and can be applied to known
specific DE sources, such as quintessense scalar fields or tachyonic fluids.
Considering the simple equation of state $p= (\gamma-1) \mu$ with $0\leq\gamma
<2/3$, we show that the free parameters and boundary conditions can be selected
for an adequate description of a local DM overdensity evolving in a suitable
cosmic background that accurately fits current observational data. While a DE
dominated scenario emerges in the asymptotic future, with total $\Omega$ and
$q$ tending respectively to 1 and -1/2 for all cosmic observers, the effects of
inhomogeneity and anisotropy yield different local behavior and evolution rates
for these parameters in the local overdense region. We suggest that the models
presented can be directly applied to explore the effects of various DE
formalisms on local DM cosmological inhomogeneities.

i.e. ~L* objects at 1<z<3. Of these, we present new data for 11 objects not
previously observed at submillimetre wavelengths and additional data for a
further 3. The detection rate is 42 per cent, much higher than typically
reported for samples of QSOs. Detection statistics show (at the 3-4 sigma
level) that this sample of absorbed QSOs has a higher submillimetre output than
a matched sample of unabsorbed QSOs. We argue that the far-infrared luminosity
is produced by massive star formation. In this case, the correlation found
between far-infrared luminosity and redshift can be interpreted as cosmological
evolution of the star-formation rate in the QSO host galaxies. Since the
submillimetre luminous phase is confined to z>1.5, the high star formation
rates are consistent with a scenario in which the QSOs evolve to become local
luminous elliptical galaxies.
  Combining these results with previously published data for X-ray unabsorbed
QSOs and submillimetre-selected galaxies we propose the following evolutionary
sequence: the forming galaxy is initially far-infrared luminous but X-ray weak
similar to the sources discovered by the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer
Array; as the black hole and spheroid grow with time a point is reached when
the central QSO becomes powerful enough to terminate the star formation and
eject the bulk of the fuel supply (the Compton-thin absorbed QSO phase); this
transition is followed by a period of unobscured QSO activity which
subsequently declines to leave a quiescent spheroidal galaxy.

density which is pierced by the primary powerlaw only at high energies. A low
inclination angle and an iron underabundance, suggested by the amount of
reflection and the depth of the iron edge, are consistent with the iron
K$\alpha$ line EW with respect to the Compton reflection component. Moreover,
the iron line width, if interpreted in terms of Doppler broadening due to the
Keplerian rotation of the torus, puts an estimate to the inner radius of the
latter, $r=0.6^{+1.3}_{-0.3} \sin^2{i}$ pc. Finally, two different photoionised
reflectors are needed to take into account a large number of soft X-ray
emission lines from N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe L and the FeXXV emission line. RGS
spectra show that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines, while
the underlying continuum is best fitted by an unabsorbed powerlaw with the same

critical exponent t, in disagreement with the standard theory of percolation
which predicts t = 2.0 for all three dimensional systems. Various models have
been proposed in order to explain the origin of such universality breakdown.
Among them, the tunneling-percolation model calls into play tunneling processes
between conducting particles which, under some general circumstances, could
lead to transport exponents dependent of the mean tunneling distance a. The
validity of such theory could be tested by changing the parameter a by means of
an applied mechanical strain. We have applied this idea to universal and
nonuniversal RuO2-glass composites. We show that when t > 2 the measured
piezoresistive response \Gamma, i. e., the relative change of resistivity under
applied strain, diverges logarithmically at the percolation threshold, while
for t = 2, \Gamma does not show an appreciable dependence upon the RuO2 volume
fraction. These results are consistent with a mean tunneling dependence of the
nonuniversal transport exponent as predicted by the tunneling-percolation
model. The experimental results are compared with analytical and numerical
calculations on a random-resistor network model of tunneling-percolation.

evaporation over oxide coated silicon substrates silanized with

MPTMS as an efficient adhesive monolayer between SiO$_2$ and Au. Although the
Au wires are initially 2$\mu$m wide, gaps with length $\sim$1nm and width
$\sim$5nm are observed after breaking and imaging through a field effect
scanning electron microscope (FESEM). This technique eliminates the presence of
any residual metal interlink in the adhesion layer (chromium or titanium for Au
deposition over SiO$_2$) after breaking the gold wire and it is much easier to

be executed at 4.2 K. Metal-molecule-metal structures with symmetrical
metal-molecule contacts at both ends of the molecule, are fabricated by forming
a self-assembled monolayer of -dithiol molecules between the EIBJ created Au

studied using the spin-fermion model, where charged quasiparticles of the
copper-oxygen planes are coupled to spin fluctuations. First, we analyzed
structures of the superconducting-state conductivity reflecting the coupling of
the quasiparticles to the resonance mode observed by neutron scattering. The
conductivity computed with the input spin susceptibility in the simple form of
the mode exhibits two prominent features: an onset of the real part of the
conductivity starting around the frequency of the mode omega_{0} and a maximum
of a related function W(omega), roughly proportional to the second derivative
of the scattering rate, centered approximately at
omega=omega_{0}+Delta_{0}/hbar, where Delta_{0} is the maximum value of the
superconducting gap. The two structures are well known from earlier studies.
Their physical meaning, however, has not been sufficiently elucidated thus far.
Our analysis involving quasiparticle spectral functions provides a clear
interpretation. Second, we explored the role played by the spin-fluctuation
continuum. Third, we investigated the temperature dependence of the
conductivity, of the intraband spectral weight, and of the effective kinetic
energy. The changes of the latter two quantities below Tc are determined by the
formation of the gap, by a feedback effect of the spin fluctuations on the
quasiparticles, and by a significant shift of the chemical potential.

spectra (PES) have a conspicuous SO side peak, similar to that of experiments.
$T_{\rm K}$ is estimated to be about 70 K in $\gamma$-Ce, while to be about
1700 K in $\alpha$-Ce. In CeSb, the double-peak-like structure of PES is
reproduced. In addition, $T_{\rm K}$ which is not so low is obtained because HI
is enhanced just at the Fermi energy in the DMFT band.

  Tentatively scheduled for July issue",,"10.1103/RevModPhys.77.881",,"cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The experimental results relevant for the understanding of the microscopic
dynamics in liquid metals are reviewed, with special regards to the ones
achieved in the last two decades. Inelastic Neutron Scattering played a major
role since the development of neutron facilities in the sixties. The last ten
years, however, saw the development of third generation radiation sources,
which opened the possibility of performing Inelastic Scattering with X rays,
thus disclosing previously unaccessible energy-momentum regions. The purely
coherent response of X rays, moreover, combined with the mixed
coherent/incoherent response typical of neutron scattering, provides enormous
potentialities to disentangle aspects related to the collectivity of motion
from the single particle dynamics.
  If the last twenty years saw major experimental developments, on the
theoretical side fresh ideas came up to the side of the most traditional and
established theories. Beside the raw experimental results, therefore, we review
models and theoretical approaches for the description of microscopic dynamics
over different length-scales, from the hydrodynamic region down to the single
particle regime, walking the perilous and sometimes uncharted path of the
generalized hydrodynamics extension. Approaches peculiar of conductive systems,
based on the ionic plasma theory, are also considered, as well as kinetic and
mode coupling theory applied to hard sphere systems, which turn out to mimic
with remarkable detail the atomic dynamics of liquid metals. Finally, cutting
edges issues and open problems, such as the ultimate origin of the anomalous
acoustic dispersion or the relevance of transport properties of a conductive
systems in ruling the ionic dynamic structure factor are discussed.

mass model is used to describe the slowly varying spatial envelope
wavefunctions of spinless electrons near the Fermi level at two inequivalent
valleys (K-points) in terms of the four component Dirac equation for massless
fermions, with the role of spin assumed by pseudospin due to the relative
amplitude of the wave function on the sublattice atoms (``A'' and ``B''). Using
boundary conditions at the ends of the tube that neither break valley
degeneracy nor mix pseudospin eigenvectors, we use degenerate perturbation
theory to show that the presence of impurities has two effects. Firstly, the
position of the impurity with respect to the spatial variation of the envelope
standing waves results in a sinusoidal oscillation of energy level shift as a
function of energy. Secondly, the position of the impurity within the hexagonal
graphite unit cell produces a particular 4 by 4 matrix structure of the
corresponding effective Hamiltonian. The symmetry of this Hamiltonian with
respect to pseudospin flip is related to degeneracy breaking and, for an
armchair tube, the symmetry with respect to mirror reflection in the nanotube
axis is related to pseudospin mixing.

inelastic disks using discrete simulation and prescribing the pressure and the
shear rate. We show that, in the limit of rigid grains, the shear state is
determined by a single dimensionless number, called inertial number I, which
describes the ratio of inertial to pressure forces. Small values of I
correspond to the quasi-static regime of soil mechanics, while large values of
I correspond to the collisional regime of the kinetic theory. Those shear
states are homogeneous, and become intermittent in the quasi-static regime.
When I increases in the intermediate regime, we measure an approximately linear
decrease of the solid fraction from the maximum packing value, and an
approximately linear increase of the effective friction coefficient from the
static internal friction value. From those dilatancy and friction laws, we
deduce the constitutive law for dense granular flows, with a plastic Coulomb
term and a viscous Bagnold term. We also show that the relative velocity
fluctuations follow a scaling law as a function of I. The mechanical
characteristics of the grains (restitution, friction and elasticity) have a
very small influence in this intermediate regime. Then, we explain how the
friction law is related to the angular distribution of contact forces, and why
the local frictional forces have a small contribution to the macroscopic
friction. At the end, as an example of heterogeneous stress distribution, we
describe the shear localization when gravity is added.

environments which support the interaction of multiple participants over the
Internet have become increasingly available and economically significant, most
notably in the computer gaming industry. Such systems, commonly called
networked virtual environments (NVEs), are usually based on a client-server
architecture where for performance reasons and bandwidth restrictions, the
simulation is partially deferred to the clients. This inevitable architectural
choice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic
integrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the
physical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality
of events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of
semantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive
policies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and
are therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity
protocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to
audit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates
low network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally
decouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the
simulation.

formulation of general relativity provides a powerful setting for studying the
spacetime dynamics, in particular gravitational radiation from black hole
systems. Here we revisit the kinematics and dynamics of null hypersurfaces by
making use of some 3+1 slicing of spacetime. In particular, the additional
structures induced on null hypersurfaces by the 3+1 slicing permit a natural
extension to the full spacetime of geometrical quantities defined on the null
hypersurface. This 4-dimensional point of view facilitates the link between the
null and spatial geometries. We proceed by reformulating the isolated horizon
structure in this framework. We also reformulate previous works, such as
Damour's black hole mechanics, and make the link with a previous 3+1 approach
of black hole horizon, namely the membrane paradigm. We explicit all
geometrical objects in terms of 3+1 quantities, putting a special emphasis on
the conformal 3+1 formulation. This is in particular relevant for the initial
data problem of black hole spacetimes for numerical relativity. Illustrative
examples are provided by considering various slicings of Schwarzschild and Kerr
spacetimes.

transversely polarized cross sections are large. We trace these large
enhancements to soft gluon emission near partonic threshold, and we suggest
that with a physically-motivated cut-off enhancements beyond lowest order are
moderated relative to resummed perturbation theory, but still significant. The
unpolarized dilepton cross section for the GSI kinematics may therefore provide
information on the relation of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics in
hadronic scattering. The spin asymmetry turns out to be rather robust,
relatively insensitive to higher orders, resummation, and the cut-offs.

general gauge (singular) theory, and, in particular, to relate the structure of
gauge transformations with the constraint structure of a theory in the
Hamiltonian formulation. We demonstrate that the symmetry structure of a theory
action can be completely revealed by solving the so-called symmetry equation.
We develop a corresponding constructive procedure of solving the symmetry
equation with the help of a special orthogonal basis for the constraints. Thus,
we succeed in describing all the gauge transformations of a given action. We
find the gauge charge as a decomposition in the orthogonal constraint basis.
Thus, we establish a relation between the constraint structure of a theory and
the structure of its gauge transformations. In particular, we demonstrate that,
in the general case, the gauge charge cannot be constructed with the help of
some complete set of first-class constraints alone, because the charge
decomposition also contains second-class constraints. The above-mentioned
procedure of solving the symmetry equation allows us to describe the structure
of an arbitrary symmetry for a general singular action. Finally, using the
revealed structure of an arbitrary gauge symmetry, we give a rigorous proof of
the equivalence of two definitions of physicality condition in gauge theories:
one of them states that physical functions are gauge-invariant on the
extremals, and the other requires that physical functions commute with FCC (the
Dirac conjecture).

natural number n, a certain polynomial in the coefficients of the Conway
polynomial is a primitive integer-valued degree n Vassiliev invariant, but that
modulo 2, it becomes degree n-1. The conjecture then naturally suggests itself
that these primitive invariants are congruent to integer-valued degree n-1
invariants. In this note, the consequences of this conjecture are explored.
Under an additional assumption, it is shown that this conjecture implies that
the Conway polynomial of an amphicheiral knot has the property that
C(z)C(iz)C(z^2) is a perfect square inside the ring of power series with
integer coefficients, or, equivalently, the image of C(z)C(iz)C(z^2) is a
perfect square inside the ring of polynomials with Z_4 coefficients. In fact,
it is probably the case that the Conway polynomial of an amphicheiral knot
always can be written as f(z)f(-z) for some polynomial f(z) with integer
coefficients, and this actually implies the above ""perfect squares"" conditions.
Indeed, by work of Kawauchi and Hartley, this is known for all negative
amphicheiral knots and for all strongly positive amphicheiral knots. In general
it remains unsolved, and this paper can be seen as some evidence that it is
indeed true in general. [Added 2/22/12: Of note is the recent paper
arXiv:1106.5634v1 [math.GT] by Ermotti, Hongler and Weber, which finds a
counterexample to the conjecture that all Conway polynomials of amphicheiral
knots are of the form f(z)f(-z). Intriguingly, their main example still
satisfies C(z)C(iz)C(z^2)=f(z)^2 for a power series f(z), making the main
conjecture of the present paper that much more compelling, in the author's
opinion.]

to molecular biology are rigorous estimates of the mutation rates of polymerase
chain reactions from uniform samples of the population after the reaction.
First, we consider nonhomogeneous processes, which are more adapted to real
reactions. Second, recalling that the first moment estimator is analytically
known only in the infinite population limit, we provide rigorous confidence
intervals for this estimator that are valid for any finite population. Our
bounds are explicit, nonasymptotic and valid for a wide class of nonhomogeneous
branching Markov processes that we describe in detail. In the setting of
polymerase chain reactions, our results imply that enlarging the size of the
sample becomes useless for surprisingly small sizes. Establishing confidence
intervals requires precise estimates of the second moment of random samples.
The proof of these estimates is more involved than the proofs that allowed us,
in a previous paper, to deal with the first moment. On the other hand, our
method uses various, seemingly new, monotonicity properties of the harmonic
moments of sums of exchangeable random variables.

testing nonparametric hypotheses about nonparametric functions. The likelihood
ratio statistics are constructed based on the assumption that the distributions
of stochastic errors are in a certain parametric family. We extend their work
to the case where the error distribution is completely unspecified via newly
proposed sieve empirical likelihood ratio (SELR) tests. The approach is also
applied to test conditional estimating equations on the distributions of
stochastic errors. It is shown that the proposed SELR statistics follow
asymptotically rescaled \chi^2-distributions, with the scale constants and the
degrees of freedom being independent of the nuisance parameters. This
demonstrates that the Wilks phenomenon observed in Fan, Zhang and Zhang [Ann.
Statist. 29 (2001) 153-193] continues to hold under more relaxed models and a
larger class of techniques. The asymptotic power of the proposed test is also
derived, which achieves the optimal rate for nonparametric hypothesis testing.
The proposed approach has two advantages over the generalized likelihood ratio
method: it requires one only to specify some conditional estimating equations
rather than the entire distribution of the stochastic error, and the procedure
adapts automatically to the unknown error distribution including
heteroscedasticity. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate our proposed
procedure empirically.

of modes of a bootstrap version of a standard kernel density estimator. We
argue that the simplest form of that method suffers from the same difficulties
that inhibit level accuracy of Silverman's bandwidth-based test for modality:
the conditional distribution of the bootstrap form of a density estimator is
not a good approximation to the actual distribution of the estimator. This
difficulty is less pronounced if the density estimator is oversmoothed, but the
problem of selecting the extent of oversmoothing is inherently difficult. It is
shown that the optimal bandwidth, in the sense of producing optimally high
sensitivity, depends on the widths of putative bumps in the unknown density and
is exactly as difficult to determine as those bumps are to detect. We also
develop a second approach to ascribing a probability to shape, using Muller and
Sawitzki's notion of excess mass. In contrast to the context just discussed, it
is shown that the bootstrap distribution of empirical excess mass is a
relatively good approximation to its true distribution. This leads to empirical
approximations to the likelihoods of different levels of ``modal sharpness,''
or ``delineation,'' of modes of a density. The technique is illustrated
numerically.

monotone nonincreasing in the bandwidth if the kernel is a Gaussian density.
There is numerical evidence of nonmonotonicity in the case of some non-Gaussian
kernels, but little additional information is available. The present paper
provides theoretical and numerical descriptions of the extent to which the
number of modes is a nonmonotone function of bandwidth in the case of general
compactly supported densities. Our results address popular kernels used in
practice, for example, the Epanechnikov, biweight and triweight kernels, and
show that in such cases nonmonotonicity is present with strictly positive
probability for all sample sizes n\geq3. In the Epanechnikov and biweight cases
the probability of nonmonotonicity equals 1 for all n\geq2. Nevertheless, in
spite of the prevalence of lack of monotonicity revealed by these results, it
is shown that the notion of a critical bandwidth (the smallest bandwidth above
which the number of modes is guaranteed to be monotone) is still well defined.
Moreover, just as in the Gaussian case, the critical bandwidth is of the same
size as the bandwidth that minimises mean squared error of the density
estimator. These theoretical results, and new numerical evidence, show that the
main effects of nonmonotonicity occur for relatively small bandwidths, and have
negligible impact on many aspects of bump hunting.

moment map mu for this action, and in particular prove that its regular level
sets are connected. This result is as an infinite-dimensional analogue of a
theorem of Atiyah that states that the preimage of a moment map for a
Hamiltonian torus action on a compact symplectic manifold is connected. In the
finite-dimensional case, this connectivity result is used to prove that the
image of the moment map for a compact Hamiltonian T-space is convex. Thus our
theorem can also be viewed as a companion result to a theorem of Atiyah and
Pressley, which states that the image mu(Omega(G)) is convex. We also show that
for the energy functional E, which is the moment map for the S^1 rotation
action, each non-empty preimage is connected.

DNA molecule.
  This is a DNA chain in which all the base pairs are identical and there
exists an interface such that the base pairs dipole moments at each side are
oriented in opposite directions.
  The Hamiltonian of the Peyrard--Bishop model is augmented with a term that
includes the dipole--dipole coupling between base pairs. Numerical simulations
show the existence of two dynamical regimes. If the translational kinetic
energy of a moving breather launched towards the interface is below a critical
value, it is trapped in a region around the interface collecting vibrational
energy. For an energy larger than the critical value, the breather is
transmitted and continues travelling along the double strand with lower
velocity. Reflection phenomena never occur.
  The same study has been carried out when a single dipole is oriented in
opposite direction to the other ones.
  When moving breathers collide with the single inverted dipole, the same
effects appear. These results emphasize the importance of this simple type of
local inhomogeneity as it creates a mechanism for the trapping of energy.
  Finally, the simulations show that, under favorable conditions, several
launched moving breathers can be trapped successively at the interface region
producing an accumulation of vibrational energy. Moreover, an additional
colliding moving breather can produce a saturation of energy and a moving
breather with all the accumulated energy is transmitted to the chain.

recursive growth is reported. First, the chemical abundances measured over many
cells are found to obey a log-normal distribution and second, the relationship
between the average and standard deviation of the abundances is found to be
linear. The ubiquity of the laws is explored both theoretically and
experimentally. First by means of a model with a catalytic reaction network,
the laws are shown to appear near the critical state with efficient
self-reproduction. Second by measuring distributions of fluorescent proteins in
bacteria cells the ubiquity of log-normal distribution of protein abundances is
confirmed. Relevance of these findings to cellular function and biological
plasticity is briefly discussed.

sensitivity to noise generally increase with the number of photons in the
state. The entanglement-sensitivity tradeoff is investigated for a particular
set of states, multi-dimensional entangled coherent states. Those states
possess an arbitrarily large amount of entanglement $E$ provided the number of
photons is at least of order $2^{2E}$. We calculate how fast that entanglement
decays due to photon absorption losses and how much entanglement is left. We
find that for very small losses the amount of entanglement lost is equal to
$2/\log(2)\approx 2.89$ ebits per absorbed photon, irrespective of the amount
of pure-state entanglement $E$ one started with. In contrast, for larger losses
it tends to be the remaining amount of entanglement that is independent of $E$.
This may provide a useful strategy for creating states with a fixed amount of
entanglement.

linear system using ``functional methods'' (as opposed to discrete time
approaches). The Gaussian phase space path integral is formally given by a
determinant built from a first-order differential operator with coherent state
boundary conditions. We show how this determinant can be expressed in terms of
the symplectic transformation generated by the (in general, time-dependent)
quadratic Hamiltonian for the system. We briefly discuss the conditions under
which the coherent state path integral for a linear system actually exists. A
necessary -- but not sufficient -- condition for existence of the path integral
is that the symplectic transformation generated by the Hamiltonian is
(unitarily) implementable on the Fock space for the system.

extending that of traditional mathematical statistics. The basic setting is a
set $\mathcal{A}$ of incompatible experiments, and a transformation group $G$
on the cartesian product $\Pi$ of the parameter spaces of these experiments.
The set of possible parameters is constrained to lie in a subspace of $\Pi$, an
orbit or a set of orbits of $G$. Each possible model is then connected to a
parametric Hilbert space. The spaces of different experiments are linked
unitarily, thus defining a common Hilbert space $\mathbf{H}$. A state is
equivalent to a question together with an answer: the choice of an experiment
$a\in\mathcal{A}$ plus a value for the corresponding parameter. Finally,
probabilities are introduced through Born's formula, which is derived from a
recent version of Gleason's theorem. This then leads to the usual formalism of
elementary quantum mechanics in important special cases. The theory is
illustrated by the example of a quantum particle with spin.

law is violated for Fermions. The relation between the entanglement entropy and
the structure of the Fermi surface is discussed, and it is proven, that the
