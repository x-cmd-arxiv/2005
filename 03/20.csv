irregular galaxy NGC 2366, using Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images obtained
with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches
down to I~26.0 mag. It reveals not only a young population of blue
main-sequence stars (age <30 Myr) but also an intermediate-age population of
blue and red supergiants (20 Myr<age<100 Myr), and an older evolved populations
of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (age >100 Myr) and red giant branch
(RGB) stars (age >1 Gyr). The measured magnitude I=23.65+/-0.10 mag of the RGB
tip results in a distance modulus m-M=27.67+/-0.10, which corresponds to a
distance of 3.42+/-0.15 Mpc, in agreement with previous distance
determinations. The youngest stars are associated with the bright complex of
HII regions NGC 2363=Mrk 71 in the southwest extremity of the galaxy. As a
consequence of the diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles, the
older the stellar population is, the smoother and more extended is its spatial
distribution. An underlying population of older stars is found throughout the
body of NGC 2366. The most notable feature of this older population is the
presence of numerous relatively bright AGB stars. The number ratio of AGB to
RGB stars and the average absolute brightness of AGB stars in NGC 2366 are
appreciably higher than in the BCD VII Zw 403, indicating a younger age of the
AGB stars in NGC 2366. In addition to the present burst of age <100 Myr, there
has been strong star formation activity in the past of NGC 2366, from ~100 Myr
to <3 Gyr ago.

able to find nearly all of the collectively jammed states at each system size.
We decompose the probability $P(\phi)$ for obtaining a collectively jammed

the density of CJ packing fractions $\rho(\phi)$, which only depends on
geometry and 2) the frequency distribution $\beta(\phi)$, which depends on the
particular algorithm used to create them. We find that the function
$\rho(\phi)$ is sharply peaked and that $\beta(\phi)$ depends exponentially on
$\phi$. We predict that in the infinite system-size limit the behavior of
$P(\phi)$ in these systems is controlled by the density of CJ packing
fractions--not the frequency distribution. These results suggest that the
location of the peak in $P(\phi)$ when $N \to \infty$ can be used as a

Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ have been investigated in a wide microwave

parallel to the $ab$ plane of the single crystal. In sharp contrast to the case
for magnetic fields parallel to the c axis or tilted from the $ab$ plane, it

energy and possess two distinctly different magnetic field dependences. One
always lies higher in energy than the other and has a shallow minimum at about
0.8 kOe, then increases linearly with magnetic field. On the other hand,
another mode begins to appear only in a magnetic field (from a few kOe and
higher) and has a weakly decreasing tendency with increasing magnetic field. By
comparing with a recent theoretical model the higher energy mode can naturally
be attributed to the Josephson plasma resonance mode propagating along the

the lower frequency mode is assigned to the novel phase collective mode of the

availability of hard satisfiable instances. A plausible source of such
instances consists of random k-SAT formulas whose clauses are chosen uniformly
from among all clauses satisfying some randomly chosen truth assignment A.
Unfortunately, instances generated in this manner tend to be relatively easy
and can be solved efficiently by practical heuristics. Roughly speaking, as the
formula's density increases, for a number of different algorithms, A acts as a
stronger and stronger attractor. Motivated by recent results on the geometry of
the space of satisfying truth assignments of random k-SAT and NAE-k-SAT
formulas, we introduce a simple twist on this basic model, which appears to
dramatically increase its hardness. Namely, in addition to forbidding the
clauses violated by the hidden assignment A, we also forbid the clauses
violated by its complement, so that both A and complement of A are satisfying.
It appears that under this ""symmetrization'' the effects of the two attractors
largely cancel out, making it much harder for algorithms to find any truth
assignment. We give theoretical and experimental evidence supporting this
assertion.

to simulate dissipation effects due to the transfer of photons and/or neutrinos
within the matter configuration, we introduce the flux factor, the variable
Eddington factor and a closure relation between them. Rotation in General
Relativity is considered in the slow rotation approximation, i.e. tangential
velocity of every fluid element is much less than the speed of light and the
centrifugal forces are little compared with the gravitational ones. Solutions
are properly matched, up to the first order in the Kerr parameter, to the
exterior Kerr-Vaidya metric and the evolution of the physical variables are
obtained inside the matter configuration. To illustrate the method we work out
three models with different equations of state and several closure relations.
We have found that, for the closure relations considered, the matching
conditions implies that a total diffusion regime can not be attained at the
surface of the configuration. It has also been obtained that the eccentricity
at the surface of radiating configurations is greater for models near the
diffusion approximation than for those in the free streaming out limit. At
least for the static ``seed'' equations of state considered, the simulation we
performed show that these models have differential rotation and that the more
diffusive the model is, the slower it rotates.

subgroup of the group O(n,1)^X acts as the group of multiplicators. Measure \nu
is sigma-finite and invariant under the action current group O(n-1)^X. Ther
case of n=2 (SL(2,R^X)) was considered before in the series of papers starting
from the article Vershik-Gel'fand-Graev (1973).

and circulating strains. The measure correlates well with efficacies of the
H3N2 influenza A component of the annual vaccine between 1971 and 2004, as do
results of a theory of the immune response to influenza following vaccination.
This new measure of antigenic distance is correlated with vaccine efficacy to a
greater degree than are current state-of-the-art phylogenetic sequence analyzes
or ferret antisera inhibition assays. We suggest that this new measure of
antigenic distance be used in the design of the annual influenza vaccine and in
the interpretation of vaccine efficacy monitoring.

$\hat{\boldmath$\alpha$}, \hat\beta$ have space factors, respectively $f$ and
$f_1$, dependent on the particle's space coordinates. The $f$ function deforms
Heisenberg algebra for the coordinates and momenta operators, the function
$f_1$ being treated as a dependence of the particle mass on its position. The
properties of these functions in the transition to the Schr\""odinger equation
are discussed. The exact solution of the Dirac equation for the particle motion
in the Coulomnb field with a linear dependence of the $f$ function on the
distance $r$ to the force centre and the inverse dependence on $r$ for the
$f_1$ function has been found.
