Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Galaxy MCG-6-30-15, based on 8 years of frequent
observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Combined with short
timescale XMM-Newton observations, we derive the powerspectral density (PSD)
covering 6 decades from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-2} Hz. As with NGC4051, another NLS1,
the PSD of MCG-6-30-15 is a close analogue of the PSD of a Galactic Black Hole
X-ray binary system (GBH) in a `high' rather than a `low' state. Like high
state GBHs, its PSD is better fitted by a smoothly bending rather than sharply
breaking powerlaw model and the break frequency is 7.6^{+10}_{-3} x 10^{-5} Hz.
Assuming linear scaling of break frequency with mass, we estimate the black
hole (BH) mass in MCG-6-30-15 to be ~2.9^{+1.8}_{-1.6} X 10^{6} solar masses.
We also derive the BH mass using a variety of new optical observations and find
a value between 3.6 and 6 x 10^{6} solar masses, consistent with the mass
derived from the PSD. Combining these data with revised reverberation masses
for other AGN we update the BH mass/break timescale diagram. The observations
are consistent with NLS1s having shorter break timescales, for a given mass,
than broad line AGN, probably reflecting a higher accretion rate. However the
data are also consistent with all of the X-ray bright AGN being high state
objects. This result may simply be a selection effect, based on their selection
from X-ray all sky catalogues, and their consequent typically high X-ray/radio
ratios, which indicate high state systems.

set of objects over the UDF which fulfill the photometric conditions for being
passively evolving galaxies at z>1.4. Low-resolution spectra of these objects
have been extracted from the HST+ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the
GRAPES project. Redshift for the 7 galaxies have been identified based on the
UV feature at rest frame 2640<lambda<2850 AA. This feature is mainly due to a
combination of FeII, MgI and MgII absorptions which are characteristic of
stellar populations dominated by stars older than about 0.5 Gyr. The redshift
identification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further
supported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy
distribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST+ACS/NICMOS imaging revealing compact
morphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive
stellar masses of 10^{11}Msun or larger and ages of about 1 Gyr. Their space
density at < z >=1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2--3 smaller than that
of their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massive
and old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. Much smaller
effective radii are derived for some of the objects compared to local massive
ellipticals, which may be due to morphological K corrections, evolution, or the
presence of a central point-like source. Nuclear activity is indeed present in
a subset of the galaxies, as revealed by them being hard X-ray sources, hinting
to AGN activity having played a role in discontinuing star formation.

97048 where it is marginally resolved. We compare the observed spatial
distribution of the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH feature and the adjacent continuum to the
predictions of a disk model that includes transiently heated small grains and
PAHs in addition to large grains in thermal equilibrium \cite[]{habart2004a}.
The model predicts that, as observed, the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission feature is
significantly broader than that of the adjacent continuum and that about 50% of
its integrated intensity comes from a radius $R<$ 30 AU. We find that the
predicted brightness profiles reproduce very well the observed ones. This
proves beyond doubt that the energetic 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission feature takes
its origin in the inner disk regions.

available over the HDF North, the HDF South NICMOS parallel, and the ACS HUDF.

sources could not be determined from the data. The number appears consistent
with the expected contamination from low-z interlopers. Analysis of the stacked

true redshifts, the actual number of z~10 sources must be <=3. To assess the
significance of these results, two lower redshift samples (a z~3.8 B-dropout

of this probe (0.3 L*) there has been evolution from z~3.8 and possibly from

within Galactic longitudes 75 to 146 degrees and latitudes -3 to +5 degrees. We
identify HISA as spatially and spectrally confined dark HI features and extract
it from the surrounding HI emission in the arcminute-resolution Canadian
Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). We compile a catalog of the most significant
features in our survey and compare our detections against those in the
literature. Within the parameters of our search, we find nearly all previously
detected features and identify many new ones. The CGPS shows HISA in much
greater detail than any prior survey and allows both new and
previously-discovered features to be placed into the larger context of Galactic
structure. In space and radial velocity, faint HISA is detected virtually
everywhere that the HI emission background is sufficiently bright. This ambient
HISA population may arise from small turbulent fluctuations of temperature and
velocity in the neutral interstellar medium. By contrast, stronger HISA is
organized into discrete complexes, many of which follow a longitude-velocity
distribution that suggests they have been made visible by the velocity reversal
of the Perseus arm's spiral density wave. The cold HI revealed in this way may
have recently passed through the spiral shock and be on its way to forming
molecules and, eventually, new stars. This paper is the second in a series
examining HISA at high angular resolution. A companion paper (Paper III)
describes our HISA search and extraction algorithms in detail.

polarization related to density perturbations to the curl mode, during the
propagation of photons through the large scale structure. Either high
resolution CMB anisotropy observations or 21 cm fluctuations at redshifts 30
and higher can be used to delens polarization data and to separate
gravitational-wave polarization signature from that of cosmic-shear related
signal. Separations based on proposed lensing reconstruction techniques for
reasonable future experiments allow the possibility to probe inflationary
energy scales down to 10^15 GeV. Beyond CMB polarization, at frequencies
between 0.01 Hz to 1 Hz, space-based laser interferometers can also be used to
probe the inflationary gravitational wave background. The confusion here is
related to the removal of merging neutron star binaries at cosmological
distances. Given the low merger rate and the rapid evolution of the
gravitational wave frequency across this band, reliable removal techniques can
be constructed. We discuss issues related to joint constraints that can be
placed on the inflationary models based on CMB polarization information and

the unabsorbed HI emission brightness. The reliability and completeness of our
HISA detection scheme have been tested extensively with model data. We detect
most features over a wide range of sizes, linewidths, amplitudes, and
background levels, with poor detection only where the absorption brightness
temperature amplitude is weak, the absorption scale approaches that of the

distinguished reliably from emission gaps. False detection rates are very low

changes by the user. It provides a new derived data type that holds the value

reduced memory usage and a substantially increased performance gain over other
available tools with operator overloading. This gain is especially pronounced

system's crosscutting concerns in order to improve its key quality attributes,
such as evolvability and reusability. Consequently, the adoption of
aspect-oriented techniques in existing (legacy) software systems is of interest
to remediate software aging. The refactoring of existing systems to employ
aspect-orientation will be considerably eased by a systematic approach that
will ensure a safe and consistent migration.
  In this paper, we propose a refactoring and testing strategy that supports
such an approach and consider issues of behavior conservation and (incremental)
integration of the aspect-oriented solution with the original system. The
strategy is applied to the JHotDraw open source project and illustrated on a
group of selected concerns. Finally, we abstract from the case study and
present a number of generic refactorings which contribute to an incremental
aspect-oriented refactoring process and associate particular types of
crosscutting concerns to the model and features of the employed aspect
language. The contributions of this paper are both in the area of supporting
migration towards aspect-oriented solutions and supporting the development of
aspect languages that are better suited for such migrations.

greater than the wavelength lambda, we find that the cross section approaches

oscillations around the classical limit whose precise form depends on the
particle mass. These oscillations give quantum violations of the equivalence

acceleration of $a_P = (8.74 \pm 1.33)\times 10^{-8}$ cm/s$^2$ which is now
commonly known as the Pioneer anomaly. Here we discuss the Pioneer anomaly and
present the next steps towards understanding of its origin. They are: 1)
Analysis of the entire set of existing Pioneer 10 and 11 data, obtained from
launch to the last telemetry received from Pioneer 10, on 27 April 2002, when
it was at a heliocentric distance of 80 AU. This data could yield critical new
information about the anomaly. If the anomaly is confirmed, 2) Development of
an instrumental package to be operated on a deep space mission to provide an
independent confirmation on the anomaly. If further confirmed, 3) Development
of a deep-space experiment to explore the Pioneer anomaly in a dedicated
mission with an accuracy for acceleration resolution at the level of $10^{-10}$
cm/s$^2$ in the extremely low frequency range. In Appendices we give a summary
of the Pioneer anomaly's characteristics, outline in more detail the steps
needed to perform an analysis of the entire Pioneer data set, and also discuss

Teitelboim. Our definition disagrees with the one obtained from the
``counterterm subtraction method,'' but the difference is found to consist only
of a ``constant offset'' that is determined entirely in terms of the boundary
metric. We finally discuss and justify our boundary conditions by a linear
perturbation analysis, and we comment on generalizations of our boundary
conditions, as well as inclusion of matter fields.

arise as the integrability conditions of Killing spinor equations. The Killing
spinor equations of a background become a linear system for the fluxes,
geometry and spacetime derivatives of the functions that determine the spinors.
The solution of the linear system expresses the fluxes in terms of the geometry
and specifies the restrictions on the geometry of spacetime for all
supersymmetric backgrounds. We also show that the minimum number of field
equations that is needed for a supersymmetric configuration to be a solution of
eleven-dimensional supergravity can be found by solving a linear system. The
linear systems of the Killing spinor equations and their integrability
conditions are given in both a timelike and a null spinor basis. We illustrate
the construction with examples.

field has a tendency to become quasi two-dimensional, i.e. uniform in the
direction of the magnetic field, except in thin so-called Hartmann boundary
layers. The condition for this tendency is that of a strong magnetic field,
corresponding to large values of the dimensionless Hartmann number (Ha >> 1).
This is analogous to the case of low Ekman number rotating flows, with Ekman
layers replacing Hartmann layers. This has been at the origin of the
homogeneous model for flows in a rotating frame of reference, with its rich
structure: geostrophic contours and shear layers of Stewartson, Munk and
Stommel. In magnetohydrodynamics, the characteristic surfaces introduced by
Kulikovskii play a role similar to the role of the geostrophic contours.
However, a general theory for quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics is
lacking. In this paper, a model is proposed which provides a general framework
for quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flows. Not only can this model
account for otherwise disconnected past results, but it is also used to predict
a new type of shear layer, of typical thickness Ha^{-1/4}.

metallic broadside coupled (BC-) split ring resonators (SRRs), or BC-SRRs.
Power coming from a point-like source located in front of the lens is focused
into a receiver located in free space behind the device. This focus is clearly
removed from the back side of the lens, and has a size which is an order of
magnitude smaller than the free space wavelength of the incoming radiation. The
imaging properties of the device mainly relies on the excitation of
magnetoinductive surface waves on the BC-SRR arrays. By simply scaling the
BC-SRRs size, as well as the arrays periodicity, the frequency of operation of
the device can be tuned over a wide frequency range. Thus the proposed design
is potentially useful for many applications ranging from megahertzs to
terahertzs.

is not restricted by this approximation. It allows us in particular to treat
configurations closer to the actual experimental ones, where the crystal length
is comparable to the Rayleigh length of the cavity mode. We use this method in
the case of the confocal OPO, where the thin crystal approximation predicts
perfect squeezing on any area of the transverse plane, whatever its size and

the minimum size of a detector on which perfect squeezing can be observed, and
which gives therefore a limit to the improvement of optical resolution that can
be obtained using such devices.
