disturbing the temperature structure of the halo and transporting metals out

of chemical elements (both in gas and in dust) relative to hydrogen has been a
subject of much discussion in the past decade. While historically the Sun has
been taken as the reference standard, it has recently been suggested that the
interstellar abundances might be better represented by those of B stars
(because of their young ages) which are just ~60--70% of the widely adopted
solar values (``subsolar''). On the other hand, the most recent estimates of
the solar carbon and oxygen abundances are also close to those of B stars. If
the interstellar abundances are indeed ``subsolar'' like B stars or the
newly-determined solar C,O values, there might be a lack of raw material to
form the dust to account for the interstellar extinction. In literature it has
been argued that this problem could be solved if interstellar grains have a
fluffy, porous structure since fluffy grains are more effective in absorbing
and scattering optical and ultraviolet starlight than compact grains (on a per
unit mass basis). However, we show in this work that, using the Kramers-Kronig
relation, fluffy dust is not able to overcome the abundance shortage problem. A
likely solution is that the abundances of refractory elements in stellar
photospheres may under-represent the composition of the interstellar material
from which stars are formed, resulting either from the possible underestimation
of the degree of heavy-element settling in stellar atmospheres, or from the
incomplete incorporation of heavy elements in stars during the star formation
process.

arcsec CO and RC data available, the CO and RC emission is as tightly
correlated as its global value; the radially averaged correlation is nearly
linear, extends over four order of magnitude and holds down to the smallest
linear resolution of the observations, which is ~100 pc. We define qco as the
log of the ratio of the CO to RC flux as a way to characterize the CO-RC
correlation. Combining 6 arcsec pixel-by-pixel comparisons across all sources
yields an average small-scale correlation of qco = 1.1 +/- 0.28; that is, the
spatially resolved correlation has a dispersion that is less than a factor of
2. There are however systematic variations in the CO/RC ratio; the strongest
organized structures in qco tend to be found along spiral arms and on size
scales much larger than the resolution of the observations. We do not measure
any systematic trend in CO/RC ratio as a function of radius in galaxies. The
constancy of the CO/RC ratio stands in contrast to the previously measured
decrease in the FIR/RC ratio as a function of radius in galaxies. We suggest
that the excellent correlation between the CO, RC and FIR emission in galaxies
is a consequence of regulation by hydrostatic pressure; this model links all
three emissions without invoking an explicit dependence on a star formation
scenario.

of population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.
Three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately
20pc, and have V-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. These objects,
which we consider to be UCDs, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical
galaxies in Virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities and
colors. These UCDs are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations of
galaxies more closely than those of Galactic globular clusters. There appears
to be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of about
two million solar masses. If the UCDs are gravitationally bound, then we
suggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental property
distinguishing globular clusters from UCDs. More than half of the UCD
candidates uncovered in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey are associated with a
single galaxy -- M87 -- which suggests that proximity to the Virgo center may
be of critical importance for the formation of these objects. These results
show that distinguishing bonafide UCDs from bright globular clusters requires a
careful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,
particularly their mass-to-light ratios. (ABRIDGED)

CXOGC J174540.0-290031. In this paper, we report the detailed analysis of X-ray
and infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. Chandra
bservations detect the source at a flux of F_X = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8
keV). After accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and in
material local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only L_X
= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 keV; D=8 kpc). However, the diffuse X-ray emission near the
source also brightened by a factor of 2. The enhanced diffuse X-ray emission
lies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infrared
images. We interpret the X-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,
and determine that the peak luminosity of CXOGC J174540.0-290031 was >2e36
erg/s. We suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the fact
that the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion disk
intercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. We compare the
inferred peak X-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. The ratio of the X-ray
to radio luminosities, L_X/L_R<1e4, is considerably smaller than in other known
LMXBs (> 1e5). This is probably because the jets are radiating with unusually
high efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellar
medium. This hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared images
of the surrounding dust. Finally, we find that the minimum power required to
produce the jet, L_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak X-ray
luminosity. This is the most direct evidence yet obtained that LMXBs accreting
at low rates release about half of their energy as jets.

agree with those at longer wavelengths that show a brighter flux ~7 days after

brightenings were detected in the sub-millimeter light curve. However, the 850
micron light curve may have had a drop <~ 16 days after the burst. The peak of
the afterglow emission was at ~90 GHz in the days before the break in the light
curve. A simple modeling is consistent with the spectral indices remaining the

wavelengths at later times and the flux at the peak falling. No significant

therefore be very useful. Seager and Mallen-Ornelas (2003) demonstrated that it

photometric characteristics of the transits. However, these techniques are
critically dependent on the shape of the transit, characterization of which
requires very high precision photometry of a sort that is atypical for
candidates identified from transit searches. We present a method relying only
on transit duration, depth, and period, which require much less precise
photometry to determine accurately. The numerical tool we derive, the exoplanet
diagnostic \eta, is intended to identify the subset of candidates from a
transit search that is most likely to contain exoplanets, and thus most worthy
of subsequent follow-up studies. The effectiveness of the diagnostic is
demonstrated with its success in separating modeled exoplanetary transits and

for distributed learning are presented. The models differ from classical works
in statistical pattern recognition by allocating observations of an independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling process amongst members of a
network of simple learning agents. The agents are limited in their ability to
communicate to a central fusion center and thus, the amount of information
available for use in classification or regression is constrained. For several
basic communication models in both the binary classification and regression
frameworks, we question the existence of agent decision rules and fusion rules
that result in a universally consistent ensemble. The answers to this question
present new issues to consider with regard to universal consistency. Insofar as
these models present a useful picture of distributed scenarios, this paper
addresses the issue of whether or not the guarantees provided by Stone's
Theorem in centralized environments hold in distributed settings.

parameter $q_0$ measured by comoving observers using local covariant Taylor

indicates that second order corrections to $q_0$ are present, but shows that if
$q_0$ is negative then its magnitude is constrained to be less than or of the
order of the square of the peculiar velocity on Hubble scales today. We argue

cosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost
exactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many

String Theory. This requires in general complicated resummations, but some
simpler cases can be identified. This is true, in principle, for models with
fluxes, where tadpoles can be perturbatively small, and for the one-loop
threshold corrections, that in a large class of models (without rotated branes)
remain finite even in the presence of tadpoles. The contents of the Thesis

G-space is equivariantly formal. Under these conditions, the forgetful map
K_{G}^{*}(M) \to K^{*}(M) is surjective, and thus every complex vector bundle
admits a stable equivariant structure. Furthermore, by considering complex line
bundles, we show that every integral cohomology class in H^{2}(M;\Z) admits an
equivariant extension in H_{G}^{2}(M;\Z).

family includes the original \alpha = 1/4, c_2 = 3/2 solution discovered by P.
Forgacs, Z. Horvath, and L. Palla, and our approach is modeled on that of their
1981 paper. Our primary tool is the ansatz due to Corrigan, Fairlie, Wilczek,
and 't Hooft that constructs a self-dual Yang-Mills connection using a positive
real-valued harmonic super-potential. Here we reformulate this harmonic
function ansatz in terms of quaternionic notation, and we show that it arises
naturally from the Levi-Civita connection of a conformally Euclidean metric.
  To simplify the construction, we introduce an SO(3)-action on S^4, and we
show by dimensional reduction that the symmetric self-duality equation on S^4
is equivalent to the vortex equations over hyperbolic space H^2. We thus obtain
a similar harmonic function ansatz for hyperbolic vortices, which we also
derive using conformal transformations of H^2. Using this ansatz, we construct
the vortex equivalents of the symmetric 't Hooft instantons, and we prove using
the equivariant ADHM construction that they provide a complete description of
all hyperbolic vortices. We also analyze when two vortices constructed by this
ansatz are gauge equivalent, obtaining the surprising result that two such
vortices are completely determined by the gauge transformation between them.

systematically evaluated using the Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation
(QRPA) and Renormalized QRPA (RQRPA). The experimental $2\nu\beta\beta$-decay
rate is used to adjust the most relevant parameter, the strength of the
particle-particle interaction. New results confirm that with such procedure the
$M^{0\nu}$ values become essentially independent on the size of the
single-particle basis. Furthermore, the matrix elements are shown to be also
rather stable with respect to the possible quenching of the axial vector
strength parametrized by reducing the coupling constant $g_A$, as well as to
the uncertainties of parameters describing the short range nucleon
correlations. Theoretical arguments in favor of the adopted way of determining
the interaction parameters are presented. Furthermore, a discussion of other
implicit and explicit parameters, inherent to the QRPA method, is presented.
Comparison is made of the ways these factors are chosen by different authors.
It is suggested that most of the spread among the published $0\nu\beta\beta$
decay nuclear matrix elements can be ascribed to these choices.
