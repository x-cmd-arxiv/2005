scattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around HD 141569A. We
explore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag from
the gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating and
maintaining these structures. We use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetric
model to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that a
broad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. This model
also suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as the
observed dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistent
with submillimeter mass measurements. We model in two dimensions the effects of
a fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,
coplanar orbit. We track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,
planetesimals, and dust. We conclude that the surface density distribution
reflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. Our most
viable model features a disk of initial radius 400 AU, a gas mass of 50
M_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within
4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. The model reproduces some features of HD
141569A's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it does
not reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor the
observed clearing in the inner disk. For the latter, we consider the effect of
a 5 M_Jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of HD

smooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then the
difference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold =
(F1-F2)/(F1+F2) \approx 0. Violations of this ""fold relation"" in observed
lenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than
the separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it
to be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which
Rfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the
distance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the
caustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is
impossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous
or not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that
can be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between
the two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. We analyze the
generic and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the

small-scale structure. The fold and cusp relations do not reveal the nature of

formation and already host massive black holes [>10^(8) M(Sun)], there must
have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range
  ~10^(6)-10^(8) M(Sun)]. The likely signature of this earlier stage is
simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z>1; >8

the z_phot > 2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies.
The restframe optical morphology of the z_phot > 2 galaxies is quite different
from the restframe UV morphology: all the galaxies have red central components
which dominate in the NICMOS H_{160}-band images, and distinct off-center blue
features which show up in (and often dominate) the ACS images. The mean
measured effective radius of the z_phot > 2 galaxies is <r_e> =1.9+/-1.4 kpc,
similar (within the errors) to the mean size of LBGs at similar redshifts. All
the DRGs are resolved in the ACS images, while four are resolved in the NICMOS

AGN. The diverse restframe optical and UV morphological properties of DRGs
derived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations, consisting of
both evolved populations that dominate the mass and the restframe optical
light, and younger populations, which show up as patches of star formation in
the restframe UV light; in many ways resembling the properties of normal local
galaxies. This interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband SEDs, which

is consistent with simple self-similar predictions, in which the properties of
clusters reflect the properties of the universe at their redshift of
observation. When the systematic effect of assuming isothermality on the
derived masses of the high-redshift clusters is taken into account, the
high-redshift M-T and Mgas-T relations are also consistent with self-similar
evolution. Under the assumption that the model of self-similar evolution is
correct and that the local systems formed via a single spherical collapse, the
high-redshift L-T relation is consistent with the high-z clusters having formed
at a significantly higher redshift than the local systems. The data are also
consistent with the more realistic scenario of clusters forming via the
continuous accretion of material. The slope of the L-T relation at
high-redshift (B=3.29+/-0.38) is consistent with the local relation, and
significantly steeper then the self-similar prediction of B=2. This suggests
that the non-gravitational processes causing the steepening occurred at z>1 or
in the early stages of the clusters' formation, prior to their observation. The
properties of the intra-cluster medium at high-redshift are found to be similar

amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system.
This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e. the observation of
photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths
(in units of relative flux) are 0.00066 +/- 0.00013 at 4.5um and 0.00225 +/-
0.00036 at 8.0um. These estimates provide the first observational constraints
on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet
emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of T_p=1060 +/- 50
K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium
with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo
of A = 0.31 +/- 0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of
stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to
atmospheric models of these objects. We compare our data to a
previously-published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts
prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon
monoxide. Based on the time of secondary eclipse, we present an upper limit on

particular emphasis on the double pulsar system J0737-3039. Special
relativistic aberration due to the orbital motion of pulsar changes both the
longitude and colatitude of the emission direction with respect to the pulsar
spin axis. The former gives rise to a shift of the arrival time of the pulse
centroid (this is the conventional ``longitudinal'' aberration delay), the
latter results in a distortion (contraction or dilation) of the pulse profile
on the orbital timescale. The amplitude of pulse distortion depends inversely
on the variation of polarization position angle across the pulse. For small
angle between the pulsar magnetic and spin axes, as inferred for PSR
J0737-3039A from polarimetric observations, the pulse distortion is significant
(\sim 1%) and the associated ``latitudinal'' aberration delay is much larger
than the longitudinal one. By monitoring the arrival time of separate pulse
components as a function of pulsar orbital phase, the latitudinal aberration
delay may be easily measured with the current timing precision, thus
constraining the spin geometry of the system. The latitudinal delay can also be
detected by monitoring system's orbital parameters on the geodetic precession
timescale. Because of the near edge-on orbital orientation of the PSR
J0737-3039 system, general relativistic bending of pulsar A's radio beam near
its superior conjunction also introduces spin-dependent time delays of similar
order of magnitude as the aberration delays. In addition, light bending splits
the pulse profile into two variable components, corresponding to two
gravitationally lensed images of the source. Detection of lensing effects is
challenging, but may be possible with existing technology.

scales with luminosity and metallicty in the ways predicted by
radiatively-driven wind theory. (3) A comparison of the masses derived from

significant discrepancy for stars hotter than 45000, although good agreement is
found for cooler stars. (4) For the hottest O stars (O2-3.5) neither the

effect of viscous evolution, photoevaporation and the differential radial
motion of dust grains and gas. For T Tauri disks, the lifetimes of dust disks
that are mainly composed of millimeter sized grains are always shorter than the
gas disks' lifetimes, and become similar only when the grains are fluffy
(density < 0.1 g cm^{-3}). If grain growth during the classical T Tauri phase
produces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete onto
the star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas disk
and the star evolves to the weak line T Tauri phase. In the weak line phase,
only dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (> 10 AU), without strong signs
of gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust. For Herbig
AeBe stars, the strong photoevaporation clears the inner disks in 10^6 yr,
before the dust grains in the outer disk migrate to the inner region. In this
case, the grains left behind in the outer gas disk accumulate at the disk inner
edge (at 10-100 AU from the star). The dust grains remain there even after the
entire gas disk has been photoevaporated, and form a gas-poor dust ring similar
to that observed around HR 4796A. Hence, depending on the strength of the
stellar ionizing flux, our model predicts opposite types of products around
young stars. For low mass stars with a low photoevaporation rate, dust-poor gas
disks with an inner hole would form, whereas for high mass stars with a high
photoevaporation rate, gas-poor dust rings would form. This prediction should
be examined by observations of gas and dust around weak line T Tauri stars and
evolved Herbig AeBe stars.

definitively assigns this source to the intermediate polar class of magnetic
cataclysmic variables. The lack of orbital sidebands in the X-rays indicates
that the X-ray period is the spin period of the accreting white dwarf.
Simultaneous ultraviolet and optical B-band photometry acquired with the
XMM-Newton Optical Monitor and coordinated optical UBVRI photometric data
acquired at the Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma) show that the optical pulse
is in phase with the X-rays and hence originates in the magnetically confined
accretion flow. The lack of ultraviolet spin modulation suggests that
accretion-induced heating on the white dwarf surface is not important in this
source. Spectral analyses of XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS spectra show that HT Cam
has a multi-temperature spectrum and, contrary to most intermediate polars, it
does not suffer from strong absorption. With its 86min orbital period, HT Cam
is then the third confirmed system of this class below the 2-3hr period gap

spectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 10^6 to
9 10^6 K. The nature (thermal vs non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum
is not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high
temperature of the plasma (~ 2.3 10^7 to 4.6 10^7 K) would be typical of what
should be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period
binary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the
combined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more
distant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is
non-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal
variability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an
eclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system. The overall X-ray luminosity points to a
significant X-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due to
colliding winds. Considering HD167971 along with several recent X-ray and radio
observations, we propose that the simultaneous observation of non-thermal
radiation in the X-ray (below 10.0 keV) and radio domains appears rather
unlikely. Our investigation of our XMM-Newton data of NGC6604 reveals a rather

for magnetic field induced vortices in 2D superconducting networks. Two
different dynamical rules are introduced to investigate driven diffusive steady
states far from equilibrium as a function of temperature and driving force. The
resulting steady states differ dramatically depending on which dynamical rule
is used. We show that the commonly used driven diffusive Metropolis Monte Carlo
dynamics contains unphysical intrinsic randomness that destroys the spatial
ordering present in equilibrium (the vortex lattice) over most of the driven
phase diagram. A continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) is then developed, which
results in spatially ordered driven states at low temperature in finite sized
systems. We show that CTMC is the natural discretization of continuum Langevin
dynamics, and argue that it gives the correct physical behavior when the
discrete grid represents the minima of a periodic potential. We use detailed
finite size scaling methods to analyze the spatial structure of the steady
states. We find that finite size effects can be subtle and that very long
simulation times can be needed to arrive at the correct steady state. For
particles moving on a triangular grid, we find that the ordered moving state is
a transversely pinned smectic that becomes unstable to an anisotropic liquid on
sufficiently large length scales. For particles moving on a square grid, the
moving state is a similar smectic at large drives, but we find evidence for a
possible moving solid at lower drives. We find that the driven liquid on the
square grid has long range hexatic order, and we explain this as a specifically
non-equilibrium effect. We show that, in the liquid, fluctuations are diffusive
in both the transverse and longitudinal directions.

between macroscopic bodies is developed. Unlike the mean vdW force that is
determined by all quantum states that contribute to the optical absorption, the
energies of those excitations of the interacting bodies that contribute
effectively to the vdW force noise are thermal energies. Contrary to the mean
vdW force the vdW force noise drops with decreasing temperature. Due to these
differences the main mechanism of the mean vdW force and that of the vdW force
noise may be different, e.g., the mean vdW force is determined by electronic
xcitations, the force noise by the random lattice or impurity dynamics. Since
the vdW force is linear in the fields squared the dependence of the vdW force
noise correlation function on time difference is determined not by one but by
two frequencies: the spectral density depends not only on the frequency of its
measurement but also on the integral over the second frequency. The dependence
of its integrand on this frequency and emperature is quantum-like even at small
measurement frequency, and such may be the behavior of the vdW noise. In the
case of interacting metals the vdW force noise is enhanced by dc voltage
applied across these metals. This additional noise is proportional to the
voltage squared and to the spectral density of the random electric field at the
frequency of noise measurement. The theory is in qualitative agreement with
experiments.

stabilizes both the ordered (body-centered-cubic) phase and the glassy state

along an easy or a hard axis. In the latter case, the in-plane reorientation of
the magnetization is shown to be continuous at T=0, in agreement with free spin
wave theory, and discontinuous at finite temperature $T>0$, in contrast with
the prediction of mean field theory. The discontinuity in the orientation angle
creates a jump in the magnon energy gap, and it is the reason why, for $T>0$,
the energy does not go to zero at the reorientation field. Above the Curie
temperature $T_C$, the magnon energy gap $E_0(H)$ vanishes for H=0 both in the
easy and in the hard case. As $H$ is increased, the gap is found to increase
almost linearly with $H$, but with different slopes depending on the field
orientation. In particular, the slope is smaller when $H$ is along the hard
axis. Such a magnetic anisotropy of the spin-wave energies is shown to persist
well above $T_C$ ($T \approx 1.2 T_C$).

junctions consist of two metal electrodes separated by a nanometer-thick
ferroelectric barrier. The current-voltage characteristics of FTJs are analyzed
under the assumption that the direct electron tunneling represents the dominant
conduction mechanism. First, the influence of converse piezoelectric effect
inherent in ferroelectric materials on the tunnel current is described. The
calculations show that the lattice strains of piezoelectric origin modify the
current-voltage relationship owing to strain-induced changes of the barrier
thickness, electron effective mass, and position of the conduction-band edge.
Remarkably, the conductance minimum becomes shifted from zero voltage due to
the piezoelectric effect, and a strain-related resistive switching takes place
after the polarization reversal in a ferroelectric barrier. Second, we analyze
the influence of the internal electric field arising due to imperfect screening
of polarization charges by electrons in metal electrodes. It is shown that, for
asymmetric FTJs, this depolarizing-field effect also leads to a considerable
change of the barrier resistance after the polarization reversal. However, the
symmetry of the resulting current-voltage loop is different from that
characteristic of the strain-related resistive switching. The crossover from
one to another type of the hysteretic curve, which accompanies the increase of
FTJ asymmetry, is described taking into account both the strain and
depolarizing-field effects. It is noted that asymmetric FTJs with dissimilar
top and bottom electrodes are preferable for the non-volatile memory
applications because of a larger resistance on/off ratio.

influences the scaling and geometrical properties of the network. In particular
the average distance between nodes is smaller for causal networks than for
corresponding homogeneous networks. We explain the origin of this effect and
illustrate it using as an example a solvable model of random trees. We also
discuss the issue of stability of the scale-free node degree distribution. We
show that a surplus of links may lead to the emergence of a singular node with
the degree proportional to the total number of links. This effect is closely
related to the backgammon condensation known from the balls-in-boxes model.

parity effect on persistent currents in superconducting nanorings interrupted

else has a sufficiently small low-energy density of states, and thus is away
from a quantum phase transition. This continuation takes local operators into
local operators, while approximately preserving the ground state expectation
values. We apply this continuation to the problem of gauge theories coupled to

identify confinement. We also apply the continuation to local bosonic models
with emergent gauge theories. We show that local gauge invariance is
topological and cannot be broken by any local perturbations in the bosonic

into a directed graph: graph's nodes substitute decision and action points;
graph's directed edges substitute action arrows.
  The number of independent paths equals easy-to-compute cyclomatic complexity
of the graph. Association of a vector to each path creates a path vector space.
Independence of the paths is equivalent to linear independence of the vectors.
It is sufficient to test any base of the path space to complete the procedure.

introducing some shortcut in order to make the presentation elementary. The

to describe their world lines (Rindler's hyperbolae) with respect to the FFRS,

that the some results of General Relativity (GR) can be obtained in terms of

selfconsistently in the plane of temperature and quark chemical potential. Both
strong and intermediate diquark coupling strengths are considered. We show that

relevant for compact star evolution, i.e., below T ~ 50 MeV. The stability and
stucture of isothermal quark star configurations are evaluated. For
intermediate coupling, quark stars are composed of a mixed phase of normal (NQ)
and two-flavor superconducting (2SC) quark matter up to a maximum mass of 1.21
M_sun. At higher central densities, a phase transition to the three-flavor
color flavor locked (CFL) phase occurs and the configurations become unstable.
For the strong diquark coupling we find stable stars in the 2SC phase, with
masses up to 1.326 M_sun. A second family of more compact configurations
(twins) with a CFL quark matter core and a 2SC shell is also found to be
stable. The twins have masses in the range 1.301 ... 1.326 M_sun. We consider
also hot isothermal configurations at temperature T=40 MeV. When the hot
maximum mass configuration cools down, due to emission of photons and
neutrinos, a mass defect of 0.1 M_sun occurs and two final state configurations
are possible.

`no-lose' theorem for Higgs discovery at the LHC that applies if Higgs bosons
do not decay to other Higgs bosons - namely, with L=300 fb^-1, there is always
one or more `standard' Higgs detection channel with at least a 5 sigma signal.
However, we provide examples of no-Higgs-to-Higgs cases for which all the
standard signals are no larger than 7 sigma implying that if the available L is
smaller or the simulations performed by ATLAS and CMS turn out to be overly
optimistic, all standard Higgs signals could fall below 5 sigma even in the
no-Higgs-to-Higgs part of NMSSM parameter space. In the vast bulk of NMSSM
parameter space, there will be Higgs-to-Higgs decays. We show that when such
decays are present it is possible for all the standard detection channels to
have very small significance. In most such cases, the only strongly produced
Higgs boson is one with fairly SM-like couplings that decays to two lighter
Higgs bosons (either a pair of the lightest CP-even Higgs bosons, or, in the
largest part of parameter space, a pair of the lightest CP-odd Higgs bosons). A
number of representative bench-mark scenarios of this type are delineated in

group with an extra U(1) factor is presented for the Standard Model as well as
for the MSSM. The extra gauge boson gets massive through a Stueckelberg type
coupling to a pseudo-scalar, instead of a Higgs effect. This new massive
neutral gauge boson Z' has vector and axial vector couplings uniquely different
from those of conventional extra abelian gauge bosons, such as appear e.g. in
GUT models. The extended MSSM furthermore contains two extra neutralinos and
one extra neutral CP-even scalar, the latter with a mass larger than that of
the Z'. One interesting scenario that emerges is an LSP that is dominantly
composed out of the new neutralinos, leading to a possible new superweak
candidate for dark matter. We investigate signatures of the Stueckelberg
extension at a linear collider and discuss techniques for the detection of the
expected sharp Z' resonance. It turns out that the substantially modified
forward-backward asymmetry around the Z' pole provides an important signal.

with this specific regularization, we obtain a time interval of existence which

relaxation of, the rank of A. This yields an asymptotically optimal guarantee
in an algorithm for computing low-rank approximations of A. We also prove
asymptotically optimal estimates on the spectral norm and the cut-norm of
random submatrices of A. The result for the cut-norm yields a slight
improvement on the best known sample complexity for an approximation algorithm
for MAX-2CSP problems. We use methods of Probability in Banach spaces, in

high dimensional data, and the concise description of its underlying geometry
and density. In the analysis of large scale simulations of complex dynamical
systems, where the notion of time evolution comes into play, important problems
are the identification of slow variables and dynamically meaningful reaction
coordinates that capture the long time evolution of the system. In this paper
we provide a unifying view of these apparently different tasks, by considering
a family of {\em diffusion maps}, defined as the embedding of complex (high
dimensional) data onto a low dimensional Euclidian space, via the eigenvectors
of suitably defined random walks defined on the given datasets. Assuming that
the data is randomly sampled from an underlying general probability
distribution $p(\x)=e^{-U(\x)}$, we show that as the number of samples goes to
infinity, the eigenvectors of each diffusion map converge to the eigenfunctions
of a corresponding differential operator defined on the support of the
probability distribution. Different normalizations of the Markov chain on the
graph lead to different limiting differential operators. One normalization
gives the Fokker-Planck operators with the same potential U(x), best suited for
the study of stochastic differential equations as well as for clustering.
Another normalization gives the Laplace-Beltrami (heat) operator on the
manifold in which the data resides, best suited for the analysis of the
geometry of the dataset, regardless of its possibly non-uniform density.

In this paper we consider dynamic importance sampling in the setting of
uniformly recurrent Markov chains. By ``dynamic'' we mean that in the course of
a single simulation, the change of measure can depend on the outcome of the
simulation up till that time. Based on a control-theoretic approach to large
deviations, the existence of asymptotically optimal dynamic schemes is
demonstrated in great generality. The implementation of the dynamic schemes is
carried out with the help of a limiting Bellman equation. Numerical examples

present a new machine-learning method, critical random networks (CRNs), for
predicting one-dimensional structures, and apply it, with position-specific
scoring matrices, to the prediction of secondary structures (SS), contact
numbers (CN), and residue-wise contact orders (RWCO). The present method
achieves, on average, $Q_3$ accuracy of 77.8% for SS, correlation coefficients

prediction is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, and that of the CN
prediction is a significant improvement over previous methods. We give a
detailed formulation of critical random networks-based prediction scheme, and
examine the context-dependence of prediction accuracies. In order to study the
nonlinear and multi-body effects, we compare the CRNs-based method with a
purely linear method based on position-specific scoring matrices. Although not
superior to the CRNs-based method, the surprisingly good accuracy achieved by
the linear method highlights the difficulty in extracting structural features
of higher order from amino acid sequence beyond that provided by the
position-specific scoring matrices.

rapid development during the last few years. Initial motivation for playing
games, in the quantum world, comes from the possibility of re-formulating
quantum communication protocols, and algorithms, in terms of games between
quantum and classical players. The possibility led to the view that quantum
games have a potential to provide helpful insight into working of quantum
algorithms, and even in finding new ones. This thesis analyzes and compares
some interesting games when played classically and quantum mechanically. A
large part of the thesis concerns investigations into a refinement notion of
the Nash equilibrium concept. The refinement, called an evolutionarily stable
strategy (ESS), was originally introduced in 1970s by mathematical biologists
to model an evolving population using techniques borrowed from game theory.
Analysis is developed around a situation when quantization changes ESSs without
affecting corresponding Nash equilibria. Effects of quantization on
solution-concepts other than Nash equilibrium are presented and discussed. For
this purpose the notions of value of coalition, backwards-induction outcome,
and subgame-perfect outcome are selected. Repeated games are known to have
different information structure than one-shot games. Investigation is presented
into a possible way where quantization changes the outcome of a repeated game.
Lastly, two new suggestions are put forward to play quantum versions of
classical matrix games. The first one uses the association of De Broglie's
waves, with travelling material objects, as a resource for playing a quantum
game. The second suggestion concerns an EPR type setting exploiting directly
the correlations in Bell's inequalities to play a bi-matrix game.
