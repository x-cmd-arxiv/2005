theories `a la Ginzburg-Landau. In this approach, the WMAP statement excluding
the pure phi^4 potential implies the presence of an inflaton mass term at the
scale m ~ 10^{13}GeV.Chaotic, new and hybrid inflation models are studied in an
unified manner.In all cases the inflaton potential takes the form V(phi)=m^2
M_{Pl}^2 v(phi/M_{Pl}), where all coefficients in v(varphi) are of order one.If
such potential corresponds to supersymmetry breaking, the susy scale is sqrt{m
M_{Pl}}~10^{16}GeV which coincides with the GUT scale. For red tilted spectrum
new inflation turns to be favoured while for blue tilted spectrum, hybrid
inflation turns to be the best choice.In both cases, we find an analytic
formula relating the inflaton mass with r (tensor/scalar ratio) and the scalar
spectral index ns: 10^6 m/M_{Pl} = 127 sqrt{r|1-n_s|} where the numerical
coefficient follows from the WMAP amplitude. We review quantum phenomena during
inflation which contribute to relevant observables in the CMB anisotropies and
polarization and we focus on inflaton decay.The deviation from the scale
invariant power spectrum is measured by a small parameter Delta.Delta regulates
the infrared divergences too.In slow roll inflation, Delta is a simple function
of the slow roll parameters. The quantum fluctuations can selfdecay in the
inflationary expansion through processes forbidden in Minkowski. We compute the
self-decay of the inflaton quantum fluctuations during slow roll:superhorizon
fluctuations decay as eta^{Gamma} in conformal time where the new scaling
dimension Gamma is expressed in terms of the amplitude, n_s and r. we discuss
the implications for scalar and tensor perturbations as well as for non
gaussianities.

it. Our approach is based on a Monte Carlo code to simulate the stellar
dynamics of spherical star clusters using a very large number of particles (a

and gravothermal collapse. Previous work established the conditions for this to
happen before the massive stars evolve off the main sequence (MS). In this and
a companion paper, we investigate the next stage by implementing direct
collisions between stars. Using a Monte Carlo stellar dynamics code, we follow
the core collapse and subsequent collisional phase in more than 100 models with
varying cluster mass, size, and initial concentration. Collisions are treated
either as ideal, ``sticky-sphere'' mergers or using realistic prescriptions
derived from 3-D hydrodynamics computations. In all cases for which the core
collapse happens in less than the MS lifetime of massive stars (~3 Myr), we
obtain the growth of a single very massive star (VMS, Mstar =~ 400-4000 Msun)
through a runaway sequence of mergers. Mass loss from collisions, even for
velocity dispersions as high as sigma1D ~ 1000 km/s, does not prevent the
runaway. The region of cluster parameter space leading to runaway is even more
extended than predicted in previous work because, in clusters with sigma1D >
300 km/s, collisions accelerate (and, in extreme cases, drive) core collapse.
Although the VMS grows rapidly to > 1000 Msun in models exhibiting runaway, we
cannot predict accurately its final mass. This is because the termination of
the runaway process must eventually be determined by a complex interplay
between stellar dynamics, hydrodynamics, and the stellar evolution of the VMS.

The X-ray nebula is affected mostly by the complex interstellar medium around
the nova and has not developed a regular shell with bulk of emission coming
from the southwestern quadrant. The part of the bright zone that is co-spatial
with the brightest non-thermal radio emission region, is found to be a source
of non-thermal X-ray emission with a power law photon index of
2.3$^{+1.5}_{-0.9}$ and alpha=0.68^${+0.03}_{-0.15}$ at about a flux of
1.7x10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. There are strong indications for nonlinear
diffusive shock acceleration occurring in the forward shock/transition zone
with an upper limit on the non-thermal X-ray flux of 1.0\times 10^{-14} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}.The total X-ray spectrum of has two components of emission. The
component dominant below 2 keV is most likely a non-equilibrium ionization
thermal plasma of kT_s=0.1-0.3 keV with an X-ray flux of 1.6x10^{-11} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}. There is also a higher temperature, kT_s=0.5-2.6 keV, embedded,
N_H=(4.0-22.0)x10^{22} cm^{-2}, emission component prominent above 2 keV. The
unabsorbed X-ray flux from this component is 1.5x10^{-10} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
The X-ray emitting plasma is of solar composition except for enhancement in the
elemental abundances (mean abundances over the remnant)of Ne/Ne$_{\odot}$ and
N/N$_{\odot}$ in a range 13-21 and 1-5, respectively. A distinct emission line
of neon, He-like Ne IX, is detected which reveals a distribution of several
emission knots/blobs and shows a cone-like structure with wings extending

with hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers to calculate the effects
of dust in such systems. The simulations are in good agreement with
observations of dust absorption in starburst galaxies, and the dust has a
profound effect on their appearance. The dust attenuation increases with
luminosity such that at peak luminosities ~90% of the bolometric luminosity is
absorbed by dust. In general, the detailed appearance of the merging event
depends on the stage of the merger and the geometry of the encounter. The
fraction of bolometric energy absorbed by the dust, however, is a robust
quantity that can be predicted from the intrinsic properties bolometric
luminosity, baryonic mass, star-formation rate, and metallicity of the system.
This paper presents fitting formulae, valid over a wide range of masses and
metallicities, from which the absorbed fraction of luminosity (and consequently
also the infrared dust luminosity) can be predicted. The attenuation of the
luminosity at specific wavelengths can also be predicted, albeit with a larger
scatter due to the variation with viewing angle. These formulae for dust
attenuation appear to be valid for both isolated and interacting galaxies, are
consistent with earlier studies, and would be suitable for inclusion in
theoretical models, e.g. semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

efficiency at about 5 to 10 %, consistent with observations. We also propose
that unbound clouds can act as a mechanism for forming OB associations. The

which showed that the different characteristics of nova outbursts can be
reproduced by varying the values of three basic and independent parameters: the
white dwarf mass-M_{WD}, the temperature of its isothermal core-T_{WD} and the
mass transfer rate-Mdot. Apart from being the largest computational classical
novae parameter-space survey, we show here that the parameter space is
constrained by several analytical considerations and find its limiting
surfaces. Consequently, we extend the grid of multicycle nova evolution models
presented in Paper I almost to its limits, adding multicycle nova outburst
calculations for a considerable number of new parameter combinations. In
particular, the extended parameter pace that produces nova eruptions includes
low mass transfer rates down to 5e-13 Msun/yr, and more models for low T_{WD}.
Resulting characteristics of these runs are added to the former parameter
combination results, to provide a full grid spanning the entire parameter space
for Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. The full grid covers the entire range of
observed nova characteristics, even those of peculiar objects, which have not
been numerically reproduced until now. Most remarkably, runs for very low Mdot
lead to very high values for some characteristics, such as outburst amplitude

from the RHESSI and Phoenix-2 instruments. The radio events under consideration
are predominantly classified as type III bursts, decimetric pulsations and
patches. The RHESSI data are demodulated using special techniques appropriate
for a Phoenix-2 temporal resolution of 0.1s. The absolute timing accuracy of
the two instruments is found to be about 170 ms, and much better on the
average. It is found that type III radio groups often coincide with enhanced
HXR emission, but only a relatively small fraction ($\sim$ 20%) of the groups
show close correlation on time scales $<$ 1s. If structures correlate, the HXRs
precede the type III emissions in a majority of cases, and by 0.69$\pm$0.19 s
on the average. Reversed drift type III bursts are also delayed, but
high-frequency and harmonic emission is retarded less. The decimetric
pulsations and patches (DCIM) have a larger scatter of delays, but do not have
a statistically significant sign or an average different from zero. The time
delay does not show a center-to-limb variation excluding simple propagation
effects. The delay by scattering near the source region is suggested to be the
most efficient process on the average for delaying type III radio emission.

background in 1D. Two aspects of this problem are considered: the design of the
detector and the filtering of the data. Our detection scheme is based on local
maxima and it takes into account not only the amplitude but also the curvature
of the maxima. A Neyman-Pearson test is used to define the region of
acceptance, that is given by a sufficient linear detector that is independent
on the amplitude distribution of the sources. We study how detection can be
enhanced by means of linear filters with a scaling parameter and compare some
of them (the Mexican Hat wavelet, the matched and the scale-adaptive filters).
We introduce a new filter, that depends on two free parameters (biparametric
scale-adaptive filter). The value of these two parameters can be determined,
given the a priori pdf of the amplitudes of the sources, such that the filter
optimizes the performance of the detector in the sense that it gives the
maximum number of real detections once fixed the number density of spurious
sources. The combination of a detection scheme that includes information on the
curvature and a flexible filter that incorporates two free parameters (one of
them a scaling) improves significantly the number of detections in some
interesting cases. In particular, for the case of weak sources embedded in
white noise the improvement with respect to the standard matched filter is of
the order of 40%. Finally, an estimation of the amplitude of the source is
introduced and it is proven that such an estimator is unbiased and it has
maximum efficiency. We perform numerical simulations to test these theoretical
ideas and conclude that the results of the simulations agree with the
analytical ones.

  Astrophysics and Cosmology",,"10.1155/ASP.2005.2426",,"astro-ph",,"  This article considers the detection of point sources in two dimensional
astronomical images. The detection scheme we propose is based on peak
statistics. We discuss the example of the detection of far galaxies in Cosmic
Microwave Background experiments throughout the paper, although the method we
present is totally general and can be used in many other fields of data
analysis. We assume sources with a Gaussian profile --that is a fair
approximation of the profile of a point source convolved with the detector beam
in microwave experiments-- on a background modeled by a homogeneous and
isotropic Gaussian random field characterized by a scale-free power spectrum.
Point sources are enhanced with respect to the background by means of linear
filters. After filtering, we identify local maxima and apply our detection
scheme, a Neyman-Pearson detector that defines our region of acceptance based
on the a priori pdf of the sources and the ratio of number densities. We study
the different performances of some linear filters that have been used in this
context in the literature: the Mexican Hat wavelet, the matched filter and the
scale-adaptive filter. We consider as well an extension to two dimensions of
the biparametric scale adaptive filter (BSAF). The BSAF depends on two
parameters which are determined by maximizing the number density of real
detections while fixing the number density of spurious detections. For our
detection criterion the BSAF outperforms the other filters in the interesting
case of white noise.

electron gas in a one-dimensional continuous ring containing a single $\delta$
barrier. We calculate the persistent current as a function of the ring
circumference, magnetic flux threading the ring, barrier strength, etc. We
compare our results with the results of correlated models like the Luttinger
liquid model and the Hubbard model solved by means of the renormalization
group. A good agreement is found. First, the persistent current decays with the
increasing ring circumference ($L$) faster than $L^{-1}$ and eventually like
$L^{-\alpha-1}$, where $\alpha>0$ depends only on the electron-electron
interaction. Second, the persistent current is a sine-shaped function of
magnetic flux. This sine-like dependence and in particular the universal power
law $L^{-\alpha-1}$ have sofar been believed to arise only in the correlated
many-body models. Observation of these features within the Hartree-Fock model
is a surprising result.

  available at http://optics.unige.ch/dook/Mg-Ni-H.html",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The Mg-Ni-H switchable mirror system shows a spectacular composition
dependence in the hydrogenated state. The optical transmission of a
hydrogenated Mg-Ni-H gradient film displays a stripe-like pattern that consists
of alternating regions of high and low transmission. This behavior is peculiar
as the composite Mg-Ni-H phase diagram only predicts a gradual change between
MgH2 and Mg2NiH4 which can not account for the observed composition dependence.
In order to understand the observed transmission pattern, the Mg-Ni-H system
has been investigated optically, electrically, structurally and morphologically
in the metallic and hydrogenated state. As-deposited, metallic, Mg-Ni
composition gradient thin films contain the Mg2Ni and MgNi2 phases for
well-defined composition regions. In the hydrogenated state, vibrational
spectroscopy shows the composition dependence of semiconducting Mg2NiH4 which
is formed from metallic Mg2Ni. On exposure to hydrogen, physical properties
change as well near the equiatomic composition and the composition of MgNi2,
pointing to possible hydride formation. The strong composition dependence of
the Mg-Ni-H system, expressed in the observed transmission, can eventually be
understood from the distribution of Mg2NiH4 and the occurrence of MgH2 for
higher Mg contents.

of a periodic elliptic equation (or a system) on an abelian cover of a compact
Riemannian manifold and the structure of the dispersion relation for this
equation at the edges of the spectrum. Here one says that the Liouville theorem
holds if the space of solutions of any given polynomial growth is finite
dimensional. The necessary and sufficient condition for a Liouville type
theorem to hold is that the real Fermi surface of the elliptic operator
consists of finitely many points (modulo the reciprocal lattice). Thus, such a
theorem generically is expected to hold at the edges of the spectrum. The
precise description of the spaces of polynomially growing solutions depends
upon a `homogenized' constant coefficient operator determined by the analytic
structure of the dispersion relation. In most cases, simple explicit formulas
are found for the dimensions of the spaces of polynomially growing solutions in
terms of the dispersion curves. The role of the base of the covering (in
particular its dimension) is rather limited, while the deck group is of the
most importance.
  The results are also established for overdetermined elliptic systems, which
in particular leads to Liouville theorems for polynomially growing holomorphic
functions on abelian coverings of compact analytic manifolds.
  Analogous theorems hold for abelian coverings of compact combinatorial or
quantum graphs.

of writhe as the average number of signed self-crossings of the ribbon axis
curve. Using the formalism we develop, we also construct a geometrically
natural ribbon on any closed space curve - the `writhe framing' ribbon. By
definition, the twist of this ribbon compensates its writhe, so its linking

"q-bio/0503011","Nicola Pugno","N. M. Pugno","On the Statistical Law of Life",,,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  In this paper we derive a statistical law of Life. It governs the probability
of death, or complementary of survival, of the living organisms. We have
deduced such a law coupling the widely used Weibull statistics, developed for
describing the distribution of the strength of solids, with the universal model
for ontogenetic growth only recently proposed by West and co-authors. The main
idea presented in this paper is that cracks can propagate in solids and cause
their failure as sick cells in living organisms can cause their death. Making a
rough analogy, living organisms are found to behave as growing mechanical
components under cyclic, i.e., fatigue, loadings and composed by a dynamic
evolutionary material that, as an ineluctable fate, deteriorates. The
implications on biological scaling laws are discussed. As an example of
application, we apply such a statistical law to large data collections on human
deaths due to cancer of various types recorded in Italy: a relevant agreement
is observed.

cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+) are stretched on hydrophobic surfaces, and
directly observed by fluorescence microscopy. The results indicate that when
these cations are added into the DNA solution, the fluorescence intensities of
the stained DNA are reduced differently. The monovalent cations (Na+, K+)
inhibit binding of histone to DNA. The divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+)
enhance significantly the binding of histone to DNA and the binding of the
DNA-histone complex to the hydrophobic surface. Mn2+ also induces condensation
and aggregation of the DNA-histone complex.

thick parallel plates made of real metal. The usual description of the
zero-point vacuum oscillations on the background of the frequency-dependent
dielectric permittivity is shown to be in contradiction with thermodynamics.
Instead, the Lifshitz formula for the Casimir free energy should be
reformulated in terms of the reflection coefficients containing the surface
impedance instead of the dielectric permittivity. This approach is presently
confirmed experimentally by precision measurements of the van der Waals and
Casimir forces in micromechanical systems and it is in agreement with
thermodynamics.

It is shown that control pulses designed for heteronucleus spins can be
translated to pulses for homonucleus spins by simply replacing hard pulses by
soft pulses with properly chosen pulse width. To demonstrate the validity of
our Hamiltonian, we conducted several experiments employing cytosine as a
homonucleus molecule. All the experimental results demonstrate that our
Hamiltonian accurately describes the dynamics of the spins, while the
conventional Hamiltonian fails. Finally we use our Hamiltonian for precise
control of field inhomogeneity compensation with a pair of $\pi$-pulses.

of years, biological evolution has experimented with a wide range of physical
systems for acquiring, processing and communicating information. We are now in

zero one-way capacity, in particular, regions of symmetric extendibility for

schemes, this mechanism can yield a homogeneous conditional phase shift of pi
even for weakly focused single-photon pulses, thereby allowing a deterministic
realization of the photonic phase gate.
