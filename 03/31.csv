consistent with observations and fall in the expected region of the

different from the Minkowski space-time result.Superhorizon scalar field
fluctuations grow for late times eta -> 0^- as |\eta|^{-1+Delta-d_} where d_ is
a novel quantum correction to the scaling exponent related to the self decay of
superhorizon inflaton fluctuations eta is the conformal time. We generalize
this to the case of the inflaton interacting with a light scalar field. These

significant and comparable power on multiple timescales, which is unlikely. A
sinusoidal fit yields a period of P=(10.273 +/- 0.002) hours and semi-amplitude
of A=(1.1 +/- 0.1)%. There are additional acceptable fits with flanking periods

Eulerian simulations that include the effects of galactic winds, driven
primarily by supernova explosions. Galactic winds produce expanding bubbles of
shock-heated gas within ~0.5 comoving Mpc/h of luminous galaxies in the
simulation, which have space density similar to that of observed Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs). However, most of the low-density intergalactic gas that
determines the observed properties of the Ly-alpha forest is unaffected by
winds. The impact of winds on the Ly-alpha optical depth near galaxies is less
dramatic than their impact on gas temperature because winds heat only a small
fraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies.
Hence, Ly-alpha absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out over
the same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas. In general, Ly-alpha
absorption is expected to be stronger than average near galaxies because of the
high gas density. Winds result in a modest reduction of this expected increase
of Ly-alpha absorption. Our predictions can be compared to future observations
to detect the wind effects and infer their strength, although with the caveat
that the results are still dependent on the correspondence of simulated
galaxies and observed LBGs. We find that wind effects in our simulations are
not strong enough to reproduce the high Ly-alpha transmission within 0.5 Mpc/h
comoving of galaxies that has been suggested by recent observations; powerful
galactic explosions or ejecta with hyper-escape velocities would be required,
but these are unlikely to be produced by ordinary star formation and supernovae
alone

traced by the Eddington luminosity ratio, seems to play an important secondary

of the interstellar medium and modelled star formation in quiescent and burst
modes. We have explored two triggers for starbursts: strong shocks and high gas
density, allowing for the possibility that stars in the burst may form with a
top-heavy initial mass function. We find that the final morphology of the

Starting from identical initial conditions, galaxies spanning the wide range of
Hubble types, with B-band disc-to-total luminosity ratios ranging from 0.25 to
0.9, can form in the same dark matter halo. Models in which starbursts are
induced by high gas density (qualitatively similar to models in which feedback
is produced by AGN) generate energetic winds and result in galaxies with an
early-type morphology. Models in which the starbursts are induced by strong
shocks lead to extended discs. In this case, the feedback associated with the
bursts suppresses the collapse of baryons in small halos, helping to create a
reservoir of hot gas that is available for cooling after $z = 1$, following the
bulk of the dynamical activity that builds up the halo. This gas then cools to
form a large, young stellar disc.

70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7), have at least one emission
line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s or are unambiguously broad absorption line
quasars, are fainter than i = 15.0, and have highly reliable redshifts. The
area covered by the catalog is 4188 sq. deg. The quasar redshifts range from
0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.47; the high-redshift sample includes
520 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 17 are at redshifts
greater than five. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to
better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based
photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology
and selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray
emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area
surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800--9200A
at a spectral resolution about 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the
public database using the information provided in the catalog. A total of
44,221 objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS; 28,400 of the SDSS
discoveries are reported here for the first time.

K-band luminosity (a proxy for stellar mass). Despite this range in fundamental
parameters, we find that the properties of the diffuse X-ray emission are very
similar in all three classes of starburst galaxies. The spectrum of the diffuse
emission is well fit by thermal emission from gas with kT ~ 0.25 to 0.8 keV and
with several-times-solar abundance ratios of alpha elements to Fe. The ratio of
the thermal X-ray to far-infrared luminosity is roughly constant, as is the
characteristic surface brightness of the diffuse X-ray emission. The size of
the diffuse X-ray source increases systematically with both far-infrared and

between the regions of hot gas probed by the diffuse X-ray emission and the

for the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*),
for the first time we calculate the emergent spectra from 3D MHD flows in a
wide range of wavelengths (from radio to X-ray) by solving the 3D radiative
transfer equations. We use the simulation data by Kato, Mineshige, and Shibata
(2004) and perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, in which
synchrotron emission/absorption, free-free emission/absorption, and
Compton/inverse Compton scattering are taken into account. We assume two
temperature plasmas and calculate electron temperatures by solving the electron
energy equation. Only thermal electrons are considered. It is found that the 3D
MHD flow generally over-produces X-rays by means of bremsstrahlung radiation
from the regions at large radii. A flatter density profile, r^{-a} with a<1,
than that of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), r^{-3/2}, is the
main reason for this. If we restrict the size of the emission region to be as
small as 10r_s, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, the MHD model can
reproduce the basic features of the observed SED of Sgr A* during its flaring
state. Yet, the spectrum in the quiescent state remains to be understood. We
also calculate the time-dependent spectral changes, finding that the fluxes
fluctuate in a wide range of the frequency and the flux at each wavelength does
not always vary coherently.

planetary systems. However, it was believed that the interpretation of the
signals and the characterization of the detected multiple-planet systems would
be difficult due to the complexity of the magnification pattern in the central
region combined with the large number of lensing parameters required to model
multiple-planet systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that in many cases the
central planetary perturbations induced by multiple planets can be well
approximated by the superposition of the single planetary perturbations where
the individual planet-primary pairs act as independent binary lens systems
(binary superposition). The validity of the binary-superposition approximation
implies that the analysis of perturbations induced by multiple planets can be
greatly simplified because the anomalies produced by the individual planet
components can be investigated separately by using relatively much simpler
single-planetary analysis, and thus enables better characterization of these
systems.

compare the magnitude of the afterglow with a those of a compilation of

the spectra of extreme island state neutron stars and low/hard state black
holes are known to be indistinguishable, while the power spectra from these

that this is inconsistent with the observations that the radio powers of

lensing, X-rays and stellar dynamics. We perform a thorough elliptical lens
modelling using arcs in the range 20<R<100kpc and weak lensing (100<R<1000kpc).
We confirm that the dark matter distribution is consistent with an NFW profile
with high concentration $c=11.7\pm0.6$. We further analyse the stellar
kinematics data of Sand etal(2004) with a detailed modelling of the los
velocity distribution of stars in the cD galaxy and quantify the small bias due
to non-Gaussianity of the LOSVD. After correction, the NFW lens model is still
unable to properly fit kinematical data and is twice as massive as suggested by
X-rays (Allen etal2001). The discrepancy between projected and tridimensional
mass estimates is studied by assuming prolate (triaxial) halos with the major
axis oriented toward the line-of-sight. This model well explains the high

sequences of models that cover a substantial fraction of the parameter space
and a longer integration time. We also included a turbulent pressure term and
found that this physical mechanism plays a crucial role in the pulsation
characteristics of the models by removing the sharp discontinuities along the
light and the velocity curves showed by models that do not account for
turbulent pressure. Finally, we investigated the vibrational and the
pulsational stability of completely convective models. We consider as the most
important finding of the present work the identification of a well-defined
region in the parameter space where they approach limit-cycle stability.
Several numerical experiments performed by adopting different values of the
adiabatic exponent and of the shell thickness indicate that the coupling
between pulsation and convection is the key driving mechanism for LPVs, a
finding supported by recent theoretical predictions.

radiative transfer simulations in the optical (Xilouris et al. 1999). We find
that the submm emission predicted by our model cannot account for the observed

scenario (Popescu et al. 2000), additional dust (to that derived from the
optical, and associated with young stars) is embedded in the galaxy in the form
of a thin disk and gives rise to additional submm emission. The other scenario
investigates whether the average submm emissivity of the dust grains is higher
than the values widely used in Galactic environments. In this case, the dust
mass is equal to that derived from the optical observations, and the submm
emissivity is treated as a free parameter calculated by fitting our model to
the observed SED. We find the submm emissivity value to be ~3 times that often
used for our Galaxy. While both scenarios reproduce the observed 850 micron
surface brightness, the extra embedded dust model is not supported by the near

the intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity as a fraction $\lambda$ of the Eddington

found that the black hole masses range between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and
$10^{9}M_{\odot}$ when $\lambda$ = 0.1 and 1.0 are adopted. Since this method

also be used for central black hole mass determination of high redshift

first consider the isotropic case (a magnetic molecule with a ground state of
spin $S$ well separated from the excited levels and also the general isotropic
Heisenberg Hamiltonian where all energy levels are relevant) and then we
include small off-diagonal terms in the spin Hamiltonian to take into account
the Landau-Zener-St\""{u}ckelberg (LZS) effect. In the first case, and for an

convenient set of equations that take into account the combined effects of LZS
and thermal transitions. In particular, these equations explain the deviation
from exact magnetization reversal at $B\approx 0$ observed in \{V$_6$\}. They
also account for the small magnetization plateaus (``magnetic Foehn effect''),

that the zero-field resistivity $\rho_{c}$ changes linearly with temperature
and extrapolates nearly to zero at 0 K, indicative of non-Fermi-liquid (nFL)
behavior associated with a quantum critical point (QCP). The longitudinal
magnetoresistance (LMR) of CeCoIn$_{5}$ for fields applied parallel to the
c-axis is negative and scales as $B/(T+T^{*})$ between 50 and 100 K, revealing
the presence of a single-impurity Kondo energy scale $T^{*} \sim 2$ K.
Beginning at 16 K a small positive LMR feature is evident for fields less than
3 tesla that grows in magnitude with decreasing temperature. For higher fields
the LMR is negative and increases in magnitude with decreasing temperature.
This sizable negative magnetoresistance scales as $B{^2}/T$ from 2.6 K to
roughly 8 K, and it arises from an extrapolated residual resistivity that
becomes negative and grows quadratically with field in the nFL temperature
regime. Applying a magnetic field along the c-axis with B $>$ B$_{c2}$ restores
Fermi-liquid behavior in $\rho_{c}(T)$ at $T$ less than 130 mK. Analysis of the

of CeCoIn$_{5}$ exhibits features typical for a heavy fermion system, low-$T$

Kondo interactions that are influenced by the underlying complex electronic
structure intrinsic to the anisotropic CeCoIn$_{5}$ crystal structure.

materials with broadly distributed microscopic heterogeneities, the fracture
strength distribution corresponding to the peak load of the material response
does not follow the commonly used Weibull and (modified) Gumbel distributions.
Instead, a {\it lognormal} distribution describes more adequately the fracture
strengths corresponding to the peak load of the response. Lognormal
distribution arises naturally as a consequence of multiplicative nature of
large number of random distributions representing the stress scale factors
necessary to break the subsequent ""primary"" bond (by definition, an increase in
applied stress is required to break a ""primary"" bond) leading up to the peak
load. Numerical simulations based on two-dimensional triangular and diamond
lattice topologies with increasing system sizes substantiate that a {\it
lognormal} distribution represents an excellent fit for the fracture strength
distribution at the peak load. The second significant result of the present
study is that, in materials with broadly distributed microscopic
heterogeneities, the mean fracture strength of the lattice system behaves as
$\mu_f = \frac{\mu_f^\star}{(Log L)^\psi} + \frac{c}{L}$, and scales as $\mu_f
\approx \frac{1}{(Log L)^\psi}$ as the lattice system size, $L$, approaches
infinity.

upon including quenched disorder in the model and breaking the homogeneous

the nodal regions are caused by d-wave superconducting clusters. Studying the
density of states (DOS), a pseudogap is observed, caused by the mixture of the
gapped antiferromagnetic state and a d-wave superconductor. The local DOS can
be interpreted using a mixed-phase picture, similarly as observed in tunneling

of compounds. Thus one is led naturally to examine the effect of the change of
tetragonality and the axial oxygen position on the electronic structure [i.e.
XANES spectrum]. We study this effect in two ways. At a given temperature we
vary the tetragonality and the axial oxygen position and quantify it in terms

increases almost monotonically with temperature from 12 K to 570 K without

stimulated discharge current (TSDC) experiments, the sample is out of
equilibrium during most of the discharge ramp. Not surprisingly, the capability
of these models to represent the data points at temperatures well below the
glass transition temperature is very poor. To overcome this limitation, we have
used the Tool--Narayanaswamy-Moynihan (TNM) model, that takes into account the
structural state of the system, to modelize TSDC data. Although it is mostly
applied to calorimetric and volumetric experiments we show how it can be
employed on dielectric data. The numerical results support the applicability of
the model and suggest how the dielectric and the structural relaxation times
may be related. The TNM model turns out to be physically sound since the
modelization of dielectric data gives also a reasonable structural kinetics of
the system. The qualitative differences between the TNM model and the
equilibrium models for different TSDC experiments is discussed. Experimental
data coming from TSDC experiments where the thermal history of the sample is
changed do not provide additional evidence but nevertheless are compatible with
the parameter values that were obtained in the fits to the TNM model.

extracted. Both a recently developed numerical method to solve inverse integral
transforms and the proposed empirical scaled permittivity expression are
employed to estimate the spectral density function of the
Landau-Lifshitz/Looyenga expression. In the simulations the concentration q of
the inclusions phase are varied. The estimated spectral functions for the
mixtures with different inclusion concentration compositions show similar
spectral density functions, composed of couple of bell-shaped distributions,
with coinciding peak locations. We think therefore that the coincidence is an
absolute illustration of a self-similar fractal nature of mixture topology
(structure) for the considered Landau-Lifshitz/Looyenga expression.
Consequently, the spectra are not altered significantly with increased filler
concentration level--exhibit a self-similar spectral density functions for
different concentration levels. We conclude that the Landau-Lifshitz/Looyenga

metal-insulator transition of a two-band Hubbard model in the limit of infinite

quenching of the charge degrees of freedom, in which the narrower band
undergoes a Mott transition before the wider one, both in the presence and in
the absence of a Hund's exchange coupling. However, this scenario is not fully
confirmed by the dynamical mean-field theory calculation, which shows that,
although the quasiparticle residue of the narrower band is zero within our
numerical accuracy, low-energy spectral weight still exists inside the
Mott-Hubbard gap, concentrated into two peaks symmetric around the chemical
potential. This spectral weight vanishes only when the wider band ceases to
conduct too. Although our results are compatible with several scenarios, e.g.,
a narrow gap semiconductor or a semimetal, we argue that the most plausible one
is that the two peaks coexist with a narrow resonance tied at the chemical
potential, with a spectral weight below our numerical accuracy. This
quasiparticle resonance is expected to vanish when the wider band undergoes the

matter slightly modifying the formula developed by Haensel and Potekhin. We
adopt the SLy and FPS EOSs for which the maximum allowed ADM mass of cold and
spherical neutron stars (NSs) is ~ 2.04Mo and 1.80Mo, respectively. Simulations
are performed for BNSs of the total ADM mass in the range between 2.4Mo and
2.8Mo with the rest-mass ratio Q_M to be in the range 0.9 < Q_M < 1. It is
found that if the total ADM mass of the system is larger than a threshold
M_{thr}, a black hole (BH) is promptly formed in the merger irrespective of the
mass ratios. In the other case, the outcome is a hypermassive NS of a large
ellipticity, which results from the large adiabatic index of the realistic EOSs
adopted. The value of M_{thr} depends on the EOS: ~ 2.7Mo and ~ 2.5Mo for the
SLy and FPS EOSs, respectively. Gravitational waves are computed in terms of a
gauge-invariant wave extraction technique. In the formation of the hypermassive
NS, quasiperiodic gravitational waves of a large amplitude and of frequency
between 3 and 4 kHz are emitted. The estimated emission time scale is < 100 ms,
after which the hypermassive NS collapses to a BH. Because of the long emission
time, the effective amplitude may be large enough to be detected by advanced
laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors if the distance to the
source is smaller than ~ 100 Mpc.

provide the most general solutions for U(1)' charges by taking into account all
constraints from gauge invariance and anomaly cancellation. We analyze various

using a high energy approximation of the distorted waves and phase shifts due
to Lenz and Rosenfelder. This approximation has been used in the separation of
longitudinal and transverse structure functions in a number of (e,e')
experiments including the newly published 208Pb(e,e') data from Saclay. We find
that the assumptions used by Traini and others are not valid for typical (e,e')
experiments on medium and heavy nuclei, and hence the extracted structure
functions based on this formalism are not reliable. We describe an improved
approximation which is also based on the high energy approximation of Lenz and
Rosenfelder and the analyses of Knoll and compare our results to the Saclay
data. At each step of our analyses we compare our approximate results to the
exact distorted wave results and can therefore quantify the errors made by our
approximations. We find that for light nuclei, we can get an excellent
treatment of Coulomb distortion effects on (e,e') reactions just by using a
good approximation to the distorted waves, but for medium and heavy nuclei
simple additional ad hoc factors need to be included. We describe an explicit

is introduced. Alongside with two baryon-rich fluids, the new model considers
time-delayed evolution of a third, baryon-free (i.e. with zero net baryonic
charge) fluid of newly produced particles. Its evolution is delayed due to a
formation time, during which the baryon-free fluid neither thermalizes nor
interacts with the baryon-rich fluids. After the formation it starts to
interact with the baryon-rich fluids and quickly gets thermalized. Within this
model with pure hadronic equation of state, a systematic analysis of various
observables at incident energies between few and about 160A GeV has been done
as well as comparison with results of transport models. We have succeeded to
reasonably reproduce a great body of experimental data in the incident energy
range of E_{lab} = (1-160)A GeV. The list includes proton and pion rapidity
distributions, proton transverse-mass spectra, rapidity distributions of Lambda
and antiLambda hyperons, elliptic flow of protons and pions (with the exception
of proton v2 at 40A GeV), multiplicities of pions, positive kaons, phi-mesons,
hyperons and antihyperons, including multi-strange particles. This agreement is
achieved on the expense of substantial enhancement of the interflow friction as
compared to that estimated proceeding from hadronic free cross sections.
However, we have also found out certain problems. The calculated yield of K^-
is approximately by a factor of 1.5 higher than that in the experiment. We have
also failed to describe directed transverse flow of protons and pion at E_{lab}
> 40A GeV. This failure apparently indicates that the used EoS is too hard and
thereby leaves room for a phase transition.

then ultimately to semiconducting. We show that applying stress can alter the
carrier concentration as well as mobility of the holes and electrons in the
majority spin channel. In addition, we found that the exchange parameters
depend strongly on lattice constant, thus the Curie temperature of this system
can be enhanced by applying stress or doping impurities.

that zero-dimensional quantum codes can be represented as self-dual additive

such codes with high minimum distance can be described as nested regular graphs
having minimum regular vertex degree and containing long cycles. Two graphs
correspond to equivalent quantum codes if they are related by a sequence of

thus classify all inequivalent self-dual additive codes over GF(4) of length up
to 12, where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known. We show
that these codes can be interpreted as quadratic Boolean functions, and we
define non-quadratic quantum codes, corresponding to Boolean functions of
higher degree. We look at various cryptographic properties of Boolean
functions, in particular the propagation criteria. The new aperiodic
propagation criterion (APC) and the APC distance are then defined. We show that
the distance of a zero-dimensional quantum code is equal to the APC distance of
the corresponding Boolean function. Orbits of Boolean functions with respect to
the {I,H,N}^n transform set are generated. We also study the peak-to-average
power ratio with respect to the {I,H,N}^n transform set (PAR_IHN), and prove
that PAR_IHN of a quadratic Boolean function is related to the size of the
maximum independent set over the corresponding orbit of graphs. A construction
