uneclipsed hard X-ray flux ratio of \sim 4 is discovered. The 18-60 keV X-ray
eclipse is found to be in phase with optical and near infrared eclipses. The
orbital eclipse observed by INTEGRAL in May 2003 is at least two times deeper
and apparently wider than in soft X-ray band. The broadband X-ray spectrum
2-100 keV simultaneously detected by RXTE/INTEGRAL in March 2004 can be
described by bremsstrahlung emission from optically thin thermal plasma with
kT\sim 30 keV. The optical spectroscopy with the 6-m SAO BTA telescope
confirmed the optical companion to be an A5-A7 supergiant. For the first time,
spectorscopic indications of a strong heating effect in the optical star
atmosphere are found. The measurements of absorption lines which are presumably
formed in the non-illuminated side of the supergiant yield its radial velocity
semi-amplitude K_v=132\pm 9 km/s. The analysis of the observed hard X-ray light
curve and the eclipse duration, combined with spectroscopically found optical
star radial velocity corrected for the strong heating effect, allows us to
model SS433 as a massive X-ray binary. Assuming that the hard X-ray source in
SS433 is eclipsed by the donor star that exactly fills its Roche lobe, the
masses of the optical and compact components in SS433 are suggested to be
M_v\approx 30 M_\odot and M_x\approx 9M_\odot, respectively. This provides
further evidence that SS433 is a massive binary system with supercritical
accretion onto a black hole.

Galactic Center within several arc-minutes around Sgr A* is the first
model-independent evidence of existence of high energy particle accelerator(s)
in the central 10 pc region of our Galaxy. This is an extraordinary site that
harbours many remarkable objects with the compact radio source Sgr A* - a
hypothetical super-massive black hole (SMBH) - in the dynamical center of the
Galaxy. Here we explore the possible direct and indirect links of the reported
TeV emission to the SMBH. We show that at least three $\gamma$-ray production
scenarios that take place close to the event horizon of the SMBH can explain
the reported TeV fluxes. An alternative (or additional) channel of TeV
radiation is related to the run-away protons accelerated in Sgr A*.
Quasi-continuous injection of relativistic protons into the surrounding dense
gas environment initiates detectable high energy gamma-ray emission. The
absolute flux and the energy spectrum of this radiation component strongly
depend on the history of particle injection and the character of diffusion of
protons during the last 10^5 years. For a reasonable combination of a few model
parameters, one can explain the detected gamma-ray flux solely by this diffuse

void formation. Since the process of void formation is non-linear, a fully
relativistic model, which simulates the evolution of voids from the moment of
the last scattering until the present instant, is presented. It is found that
in order to obtain a model of a void which evolves from $\delta_0 = - 10^{-5}$
at the last scattering moment to the present day $\delta = - 0.94$, the
existence of radiation must be taken into account. The ratio of radiation
energy density to matter energy density in CDM models at the moment of last
scattering is 1/5. This paper proves that such a value of radiation energy
density cannot be neglected and influences the first stages of void evolution.
Namely, it is important to the process of structure formation and hence
significantly influences the dynamics of the Universe in the first millions of
years after the last scattering.
  From the fact that the evolution of voids proceeds differently in various
cosmological background models we use the process of void formation to put some
limits on values of cosmological parameters. We find that the model with
$\Omega_{mat} \approx 0.3$ fits the observational data best.

observations and the WMAP data, looks preposterously complex, -- but only at
the first glance. In fact, its structure proves to be simple and regular. An
analysis in terms of the Friedmann integral enables to recognize a remarkably
simple time-independent covariant robust recipe of the cosmic mix: the
numerical values of the Friedmann integral for vacuum, dark matter, baryons and
radiation are approximately identical. The identity may be treated as a
symmetry relation that unifies cosmic energies into a regular set, a quartet,
with the Friedmann integral as its common genuine time-independent physical
parameter. Such cosmic internal (non-geometrical) symmetry exists whenever
cosmic energies themselves exist in nature. It is most natural for a finite
Universe suggested by the WMAP data. A link to fundamental theory may be found
under the assumption about a special significance of the electroweak energy
scale in both particle physics and cosmology. A freeze-out model developed on
this basis demonstrates that the physical nature of new symmetry might be due
to the interplay between electroweak physics and gravity at the cosmic age of a
few picoseconds. The big `hierarchy number' of particle physics represents the
interplay in the model. This number quantifies the Friedmann integral and gives
also a measure to some other basic cosmological figures and phenomena
associated with new symmetry. In this way, cosmic internal symmetry provides a
common ground for better understanding of old and recent problems that
otherwise seem unrelated; the coincidence of the observed cosmic densities, the
flatness of the co-moving space, the initial perturbations and their amplitude,
the cosmic entropy are among them.

six clusters of galaxies inside the redshift range 0.78 < z < 1.27. For each
cluster, we used imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to determine
morphological types by both an automated technique and from visual inspection.
We performed simulations to determine the accuracy of the automated
classifications and found a success rate of ~75% at m(L*) or brighter
magnitudes for most of our HST imaging data with the fraction of late--type
galaxies identified as early--type galaxies to be ~10% at m(L*) to ~20% at
m(L*)+2. From ground based optical and near-infrared imaging, we measured the
zero-point and scatter in the color--magnitude relation of the early-type
populations, which when combined with Stanford et al. (1998), yields a sample
of cluster early--type galaxies that span a lookback time of 9 gigayears from
the present. We see the colors of the early--type cluster members become bluer
with increasing redshift. We fit a set of models to the change in the color as
a function of redshift with the best fitting values ranging from a formation
redshift of 3^+2_-1 to 5_-3. The large scatter in resulting formation epochs,
which depends on the details of the models used, implies that we can conclude
that the oldest stars in the elliptical galaxies appear to have formed at
redshifts of z>3. We find possible evolution in the scatter of the colors, with
some high redshift clusters showing scatter as small as the Coma cluster but
others showing much larger scatter. Those clusters with a small scatter imply
either a formation redshift of at least z ~ 3 or a smaller spread in the range
of formation redshifts at lower redshifts, assuming a Gaussian distribution of
star-formation around the mean epoch.

serious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. To help resolve these
issues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmological
formation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standard
model based on dissipational collapse.In this picture, large gaseous disks may
be produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that are
gas-dominated, i.e. M_gas/(M_gas +M_star > 0.5 at the height of the merger.
Pressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium
prevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if
enough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk
galaxy. We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how
supernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,
progenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact the
formation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum
through mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the
merger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star
formation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are
gas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergers
typically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (>80%). We also show that
the formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is not
restricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. We suggest that the
hierarchical nature of the LCDM cosmology and the physics of the interstellar
gas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentum
of disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.

echelle spectroscopy; subsequent integral field spectroscopy was obtained with
the Gemini/GMOS IFU. The counter-rotating region has a peak rotation velocity
of 21 km/s as compared to the main galaxy's rotation speed of greater than 45
km/s in the opposite direction. The counter-rotating region extends to a radius
of 4'' (0.6 kpc), slightly smaller than the half-light radius of the galaxy
which is 5.3'' (0.8 kpc) and is confined to a disk whose scale height is less
than 0.8'' (0.1 kpc). We compute an age and metallicity of the inner
counter-rotating region of 3 +/- 0.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] = 0.2 +/- 0.2 dex, based on
Lick absorption-line indices. The lack of other large galaxies in this region
limits possible scenarios for the formation of the counter-rotating core. We
discuss several scenarios and favor one in which NGC 770 accreted a small
gas-rich dwarf galaxy during a very minor merging event. If this scenario is
correct, it represents one of the few known examples of merging between two
dwarf-sized galaxies.

observations of stellar H I Lyman-alpha emission lines, our primary purpose
being to look for new detections of Lyman-alpha absorption from the outer
heliosphere, and to also search for analogous absorption from the astrospheres
surrounding the observed stars. The astrospheric absorption is of particular
interest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are
otherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Lyman-alpha spectra in the
archive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS
spectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, Xi Boo, 61
Vir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70

number of heliospheric and astrospheric detections. When combined with previous
results, 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10 pc yield detections of astrospheric
absorption. This high detection fraction implies that most of the ISM within 10
pc must be at least partially neutral, since the presence of H I within the ISM
surrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection. In
contrast, the detection percentage is only 9.7% (3 out of 31) for stars beyond
10 pc. Our Lyman-alpha analyses provide measurements of ISM H I and D I column

  http://jstarck.free.fr/HC04.pdf",,"10.1155/ASP.2005.2470",,"astro-ph",,"  Currently, it appears that the best method for non-Gaussianity detection in
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) consists in calculating the kurtosis of
the wavelet coefficients. We know that wavelet-kurtosis outperforms other
methods such as the bispectrum, the genus, ridgelet-kurtosis and
curvelet-kurtosis on an empirical basis, but relatively few studies have
compared other transform-based statistics, such as extreme values, or more
recent tools such as Higher Criticism (HC), or proposed `best possible' choices
for such statistics.
  In this paper we consider two models for transform-domain coefficients: (a) a
power-law model, which seems suited to the wavelet coefficients of simulated
cosmic strings; and (b) a sparse mixture model, which seems suitable for the
curvelet coefficients of filamentary structure. For model (a), if power-law
behavior holds with finite 8-th moment, excess kurtosis is an asymptotically
optimal detector, but if the 8-th moment is not finite, a test based on extreme
values is asymptotically optimal. For model (b), if the transform coefficients
are very sparse, a recent test, Higher Criticism, is an optimal detector, but
if they are dense, kurtosis is an optimal detector. Empirical wavelet
coefficients of simulated cosmic strings have power-law character, infinite
8-th moment, while curvelet coefficients of the simulated cosmic strings are
not very sparse. In all cases, excess kurtosis seems to be an effective test in
moderate-resolution imagery.

the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) science team with the basic
ideas of estimation theory in order to see if the limited Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data is being optimally utilized. The WMAP estimator is based
on the implicit assumption that the CMB bispectrum, the harmonic transform of
the three-point correlation function, contains all of the primordial
non-Gaussianity information in a CMB map. We first demonstrate that the
Signal-to-Noise (S/N) of an estimator based on CMB three-point correlation
functions is significantly larger than the S/N of any estimator based on
higher-order correlation functions; justifying our choice to focus on the
three-point correlation function. We then conclude that the estimator based on
the three-point correlation function, which was used by WMAP, is optimal,
meaning it saturates the Cramer-Rao Inequality when the underlying CMB map is
nearly Gaussian. We quantify this restriction by demonstrating that the
suboptimal character of our estimator is proportonal to the square of the
fiducial non-Gaussianity, which is already constrained to be extremely small,
so we can consider the WMAP estimator to be optimal in practice. Our
conclusions do not depend on the form of the primordial bispectrum, only on the
observationally established weak levels of primordial non-Gaussianity.

damped oscillation with a period of around 750 s, an exponential damping time
of around 2000 s, and an initial, relative peak-to-peak amplitude of around

primordial power spectrum due to collisional damping and free-streaming of
WIMPy CDM and show that free-streaming leads to a CDM power spectrum with a
sharp cut-off at about $10^{-6} M_\odot$. We also calculate the transfer
function for the growth of the inhomogeneities in the linear regime, taking
into account the suppression in the growth of the CDM density contrast after
matter-radiation equality due to baryons and show that our analytic results are
in good agreement with numerical calculations. Combining the transfer function
with the damping of the primordial fluctuations we produce a WMAP normalized
primordial CDM power spectrum, which can serve as an input for high resolution
CDM simulations. We find that the smallest inhomogeneities typically have
co-moving radius of about 1 pc and enter the non-linear regime at a redshift of
$60 \pm 20$. We study the effect of scale dependence of the primordial power
spectrum on these numbers and also use the spherical collapse model to make
simple estimates of the properties of the first generation of WIMP halos to

modelled to arise from relativistic electrons in an emission region occupied by

magnetic fields embedded in ionised gases tend to form flux ropes interspersed
with regions of much lower magnetic field strengths. Here we develop a full
description of the evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic
electrons in a plasma divided into two distinct regions with different
strengths of the magnetic field. Electrons are able to continuously leak from
the low-field region into the high-field region. The model becomes fully
analytic for physically reasonable assumptions. We show that such a leaky box
model produces two distinct breaks in the electron energy distributions which
give rise to three breaks in the resulting synchrotron spectrum. The spectral
slopes in between the breaks are in general not constant and thus allow for
significant curvature of the spectrum. These spectra are consistent with
spatially resolved observations of the radio spectra of the lobes of radio
galaxies. The exact form of the spectra depends on the adopted diffusion rate.
The leaky box model significantly extends the time over which synchrotron
emission can be detected at a given frequency compared to the usually assumed
case of homogeneous magnetic fields. The spectral ages inferred for the
electron population from standard techniques for the leaky box model are
considerably younger than their real age.

We study easy-plane triangular antiferromagnets using a dual vortex approach,
fermionizing the vortices with a Chern-Simons field. Herein we develop this
technique for integer-spin systems which generically exhibit a simple
paramagnetic phase as well as magnetically-ordered phases with coplanar and
collinear spin order. Within the fermionized-vortex approach, we derive a
low-energy effective theory containing Dirac fermions with two flavors
minimally coupled to a U(1) and a Chern-Simons gauge field. At criticality we
argue that the Chern-Simons gauge field can be subsumed into the U(1) gauge
field, and up to irrelevant interactions one arrives at quantum electrodynamics
in (2+1) dimensions (QED3). Moreover, we conjecture that critical QED3 with
full SU(2) flavor symmetry describes the O(4) multicritical point of the spin
model where the paramagnet and two magnetically-ordered phases merge. The
remarkable implication is that QED3 with flavor SU(2) symmetry is dual to
ordinary critical Phi^4 field theory with O(4) symmetry. This leads to a number
of unexpected, verifiable predictions for QED3. A connection of our
fermionized-vortex approach with the dipole interpretation of the nu=1/2
fractional quantum Hall state is also demonstrated. The approach introduced in

several methods of producing oxalate precursors for subsequent thermal
decomposition to BaZrO3 with a view to producing high quality BaZrO3 ceramics.
The most favourable system used barium acetate, ammonium oxalate and zirconium
oxychloride, which unlike other previously reported oxalate processes allowed
near stoichiometric precipitation without requiring a large excess of Ba
reagents, elevated precipitation temperatures or slow addition of reagents.
Precise control over precipitate stoichiometry was achieved by variation of the
solution Ba:[Zr+Hf] mole ratio without requiring accurate control over oxalate
addition. XRF, XRD, N2 BET adsorption, DTA/TGA and TEM analysis showed this
process to be capable of producing BaZrO3 powders suitable for ceramics
applications. The phase purity, particle size and surface areas of BaZrO3
powders produced by calcination of these precursors can be adjusted by
variation of stoichiometry and calcination temperature. Crucibles formed from

fact that a sample with a local nuclear spin polarization can act as a source
of energy and that this energy is well above the nuclear Zeeman splitting is
explained by a simple model which takes into account the effect of a local
Overhauser shift on the edge state reconstruction.

most well-studied problems in data mining. One obstacle that limits the
practical usage of frequent pattern mining is the extremely large number of
patterns generated. Such a large size of the output collection makes it
difficult for users to understand and use in practice. Even restricting the
output to the border of the frequent itemset collection does not help much in
alleviating the problem. In this paper we address the issue of overwhelmingly
large output size by introducing and studying the following problem: mining
top-k approximate frequent patterns. The union of the power sets of these k
sets should satisfy the following conditions: (1) including itemsets with
larger support as many as possible and (2) including itemsets with smaller
support as less as possible. An integrated objective function is designed to
combine these two objectives. Consequently, we derive the upper bounds on
objective function and present an approximate branch-and-bound method for
finding the feasible solution. We give empirical evidence showing that our
formulation and approximation methods work well in practice.

on the brane are obtained by assuming the existence of a conformal Killing

terms of the Bessel functions. The behavior of the basic physical parameters
describing the non-local effects generated by the gravitational field of the
bulk (dark radiation and dark pressure) is also considered in detail, and the
equation of state satisfied at infinity by these quantities is derived. As a
physical application of the obtained solutions we consider the behavior of the
angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable circular orbit. The
tangential velocity of the particle is a monotonically increasing function of
the radial distance and, in the limit of large values of the radial coordinate,
tends to a constant value, which is independent on the parameters describing

hydrogen clouds at large distances from the galactic center, which is usually
explained by postulating the existence of the dark matter.

processes that operate in the presence of the gravitationally excited MHD waves

influenced by the presence of Lovelock higher-curvature terms in the action of

general grounds, e.g., from string theory and are often used in the literature
to model modifications to the Einstein-Hilbert action arising from quantum
and/or stringy corrections. While adding the invariant which is quadratic in
the curvature leads to quantitative modifications in black hole properties,
cubic and higher invariants are found to produce significant qualitative
changes, e.g., classically stable black holes. We use these higher-order
curvature terms to construct a toy model of the black hole production cross
section threshold. For reasonable parameter values we demonstrate that detailed

Phys. 47 (2006), no. 5, 20 pp.","10.1063/1.2196750",,"math.DS math-ph math.CA math.MP",,"  We develop a Hilbert space framework for a number of general multi-scale
problems from dynamics. The aim is to identify a spectral theory for a class of
systems based on iterations of a non-invertible endomorphism.
  We are motivated by the more familiar approach to wavelet theory which starts
with the two-to-one endomorphism $r: z \mapsto z^2$ in the one-torus $\bt$, a
wavelet filter, and an associated transfer operator. This leads to a scaling
function and a corresponding closed subspace $V_0$ in the Hilbert space
$L^2(\br)$. Using the dyadic scaling on the line $\br$, one has a nested family
of closed subspaces $V_n$, $n \in \bz$, with trivial intersection, and with
dense union in $L^2(\br)$. More generally, we achieve the same outcome, but in
different Hilbert spaces, for a class of non-linear problems. In fact, we see
that the geometry of scales of subspaces in Hilbert space is ubiquitous in the
analysis of multiscale problems, e.g., martingales, complex iteration dynamical
systems, graph-iterated function systems of affine type, and subshifts in
symbolic dynamics. We develop a general framework for these examples which
starts with a fixed endomorphism $r$ (i.e., generalizing $r(z) = z^2$) in a
compact metric space $X$. It is assumed that $r : X\to X$ is onto, and
finite-to-one.

to describe three-body systems with nonstatic pairwise interactions and
non-nucleonic degrees of freedom. Precise variational calculations of $3N$
bound states are carried out in the dressed-bag model including the new scalar
three-body force. The unified coupling constants and form factors for $2N$ and
$3N$ force operators are used in the present approach, in a sharp contrast to
conventional meson-exchange models. It is shown that this three-body force
gives at least half the $3N$ total binding energy, while the weight of
non-nucleonic components in the $^3$H and $^3$He wavefunctions can exceed 10%.
The new force model provides a very good description of $3N$ bound states with
a reasonable magnitude of the $\sigma NN$ coupling constant. A new Coulomb $3N$
force between the third nucleon and dibaryon is found to be very important for
a correct description of the Coulomb energy and r.m.s. charge radius in $^3$He.

recently introduced by Menezes and Barabasi. It is based on the observation
that for the activity f_i(t) of the constituents there is a power law
relationship between the standard deviation and the mean value: sigma_i ~
<f_i>^alpha. For stock market trading activity (traded value), good scaling
over 5 orders of magnitude with the exponent alpha = 0.72 was observed. The
origin of this non-trivial scaling can be traced back to a proportionality
between the rate of trades <N> and their mean sizes <V>. One finds <V> ~
<N>^0.69 for the ~1000 largest companies of New York Stock Exchange. Model

novel diagnostic of turbulence which emphasizes the more laminar regions [1-4].
Using Taylor's frozen field hypothesis, we investigate the statistical
properties of the exit distances of empirical 3D fully developed turbulence. We
find that the probability density functions of exit distances at different
velocity thresholds can be approximated by stretched exponentials with
exponents varying with the velocity thresholds below a critical threshold. We
show that the inverse structure functions exhibit clear extended
self-similarity (ESS). The ESS exponents \xi(p,2) for small p (p<3.5) are well
captured by the prediction of \xi(p,2)= p/2 obtained by assuming a universal
distribution of the exit distances, while the observed deviations for large p's
characterize the dependence of these distributions on the velocity thresholds.
By applying a box-counting multifractal analysis of the natural measure
constructed on the time series of exit distances, we demonstrate the existence
of a genuine multifractality, endowed in addition with negative dimensions.
Performing the same analysis of reshuffled time series with otherwise identical
statistical properties for which multifractality is absent, we show that
multifractality can be traced back to non-trivial dependence in the time series
of exit times, suggesting a non-trivial organization of weakly-turbulent
regions.

Chapter focuses on the experimental measurements of this van der Waals
interaction, reviewing various recent techniques, and insists upon optical
techniques, and notably selective reflection spectroscopy which is particularly
well-suited when excited atoms are considered. A review of various experiments
illustrates the specific effects associated with a resonant coupling between
the atomic excitation and surface modes, from van der Waals repulsion to
surface-induced resonant transfer, and with anisotropy effects, including
metastability transfer induced by a quadrupole contribution in the interaction.
The effects of a thermal excitation of the surface -with a possible remote
energy transfer to an atom-, and of interaction with nanobodies -which are
intrinsically non planar- are notably discussed among the prospects.
