regions, elongated and aligned with the radio jet axis. The aim of this series
of papers is to separately investigate the effects of radio power and redshift
on the alignment effect, together with other radio galaxy properties. In this
second paper, we present a deeper analysis of the morphological properties of
these systems, including both the host galaxies and their surrounding aligned
emission. The host galaxies of our 6C subsample are well described as de
Vaucouleurs ellipticals, with typical scale sizes of ~10kpc. This is comparable
to the host galaxies of low-z radio sources of similar powers, and also the
more powerful 3CR sources at the same redshift. The contribution of nuclear
point source emission is also comparable, regardless of radio power. The 6C
alignment effect is remarkably similar to that seen around more powerful 3CR
sources at the same redshift in terms of extent and degree of alignment with
the radio source axis, although it is generally less luminous. The bright,
knotty features observed in the case of the z~1 3CR sources are far less
frequent in our 6C subsample; neither do we observe such strong evidence for
evolution in the strength of the alignment effect with radio source size/age.
However, we do find a very strong link between the most extreme alignment
effects and emission line region properties indicative of shocks, regardless of
source size/age or power. In general, the 6C alignment effect is still
considerably stronger than that seen around lower redshift galaxies of similar
radio powers. (abridged)

gravitational potential to the present time. In describing the initial spatial
distribution, the Gould Belt, with an enhanced neutron star formation rate, is
taken into account. Different models for the initial period distribution are
considered. The star ellipticity, measuring the amount of deformation, is drawn
from an exponential distribution. We estimate the detectability of the emitted
gravitational signals by the first and planned second generation of
interferometric detectors. Results are parametrized by the fraction of the
whole galactic neutron star population made of this kind of sources. Some
possible mechanisms, which would make possible the existence of such a

an impressive record of obtaining high time resolution observations, usually it
is achieved in quite narrow fields-of-view. Consequently, the dynamic radio sky
is poorly sampled, in contrast to the situation in the X- and gamma-ray bands
in which wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources. Here we
report a new transient source, GCRT J1745-3009, detected in 2002 during a
moderately wide-field radio transient monitoring program of the Galactic center

known for any other class of radio transient. If located in or near the GC, its
brightness temperature (~10^16 K) and the implied energy density within GCRT

<L_CO> = (3.8 +- 2.0) x 10^10 K km/s pc^2. Using a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor
appropriate for starburst galaxies, this corresponds to a molecular gas mass
<M(H_2)> = (3.0 +- 1.6) x 10^10 Msun within a ~2kpc radius, about four times
greater than the most luminous local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)
but comparable to that of the most extreme high-redshift radio galaxies and
QSOs. The median CO fwhm linewidth is broad, <fwhm> = 780 +- 320 km/s, and the
SMGs often have double peaked line profiles, indicative of either a merger or a
disk. From their median gas reservoirs (~3 x 10^10 Msun) and star-formation
rates (>700 Msun/yr) we estimate a lower limit on the typical gas-depletion
time scale of >40Myr in SMGs. This is marginally below the typical age expected
for the starbursts in SMGs, and suggests that negative feedback processes may
play an important role in prolonging the gas consumption time scale. We find a
statistically-significant correlation between the far-infrared and CO
luminosities of the SMGs which extends the observed correlation for local
ULIRGs to higher luminosities and higher redshifts. [ABRIDGED]

free-free absorption from thermal ionized gas along the line of sight. For the
first time, our data reveal the spatially resolved morphology of the low
frequency free-free absorption with a resolution of ~70 arcsec. Contrary to the
expectation that such absorption arises from unrelated low density HII regions

SNR/molecular cloud shock boundaries due to ionized gas created from the
passage of a J-type shock with a speed of ~100 km/s. This makes only the second

absorption and an absence of [OII 3727] emission -- the defining
characteristics of the``E+A'' spectral signature, indicative of an abrupt halt
to a recent episode of quite vigorous star formation. We have used our spectral
data to determine the radial variation in the strength of Hdelta absorption in
these galaxies and hence map out the distribution of this recently formed
stellar population. Such information provides important clues as to what
physical event might have been responsible for this quite dramatic change in
star formation activity in these galaxies' recent past. We find a diversity of
behaviour amongst these galaxies in terms of the radial variation in Hdelta
absorption: Four galaxies show little Hdelta absorption across their entire
extent; it would appear they were misidentified as E+A galaxies in the earlier
integrated spectroscopic studies. The remainder show strong Hdelta absorption,
with a gradient that is either negative (Hdelta equivalent width decreasing
with radius), flat, or positive. By comparing with numerical simulations we
suggest that the first of these different types of radial behaviour provides
evidence for a merger/interaction origin, whereas the latter two types of
behaviour are more consistent with the truncation of star formation in normal
disk galaxies. It would seem therefore that more than one physical mechanism is
responsible for E+A formation in the same environment.

to study the relative motion of the PDR with respect to the molecular cloud and

damped afterwards. The disc changes its morphology from circular to eccentric
with the development of the spiral wave, and then from eccentric to circular
with the decay of the wave during one orbital period. It turns out that the
inward propagation of the spiral wave significantly enhances the mass-accretion

circumstantial evidence that an accretion disc is present in Be/X-ray binaries.

very successful in reproducing laboratory measurements of the scattering angle

still active about 4 x 10^8 yr ago. Key abundance-related results are: (1) We
identify ancient stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.5 dex by a well-defined horizontal
branch (HB). (2) We find a prominent RGB/ faint-AGB clump/ bump- like feature
with the same mean V-band magnitude as the HB, within uncertainties; from a
comparison with theory, ancient stars have [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 dex, with a higher
abundance level for intermediate-age stars. (3) From colour information we
infer that the median [Fe/H] > -1.11 +/- 0.08 dex for ancient stars. For NGC
205, we record (m-M)o = 24.76 +/- 0.1 mag, based on the RGB I-band tip
magnitude method. We find that stars were probably still forming less than 3 x
10^8 yr ago, which is compatible with star formation triggered by an
interaction with M31. Key abundance-related results are: (1) The RGB/ faint-AGB
is significantly skewed to redder values than that of a control field in the
outskirts of M31; it probably results from a relatively narrow metallicity and
or age range for a significant fraction of the dwarf's stars. (2) For ancient
stars we infer from colour information that the median [Fe/H] > -1.06+/-0.04
dex. We briefly compare the stellar populations of NGC 205, NGC 185 and NGC
147.

of the class of X-ray Transients, where long periods of quiescence enable
spectroscopic studies of the faint donor stars. On the other hand, neutron star
binaries are mostly found in persistent binaries, where reprocessed light from

in an exponential potential; $(b)$ Assume that the mass of dark matter
particles depends on a power law function of the scalar field and meanwhile the

constraining fluxes associated with a proximate unidentified EGRET source 3EG
J1714-3857. HESS has now seen this source in the TeV band. The complex
environment of the remnant renders modeling of its broadband spectrum sensitive
to assumptions concerning the nature and parameters of the circumremnant

multiwavelength spectral predictions from this source, using a non-linear model
of diffusive particle acceleration at the shocked shell. The magnetic field
strength, shell size and degree of particle cross-field diffusion act as

modeling of the extant data constrains these variables, and the potential
impact of the recent HESS detection on such parameters is addressed. Putative
pion decay signals in hard gamma-rays resulting from hadronic interactions in
dense molecular clouds are briefly discussed; the requisite suppression of the

potential bounds on the diffusive distance from the shell to the proximate

construct initial data for numerical relativity. This metric is obtained by
asymptotically matching a post-Newtonian metric for a binary system to a
perturbed Schwarzschild metric for each hole. In the inner zone near each hole,
the metric is given by the Schwarzschild solution plus a quadrupolar
perturbation corresponding to an external tidal gravitational field. In the
near zone, well outside each black hole but less than a reduced wavelength from
the center of mass of the binary, the metric is given by a post-Newtonian
expansion including the lowest-order deviations from flat spacetime. When the
near zone overlaps each inner zone in a buffer zone, the post-Newtonian and
perturbed Schwarzschild metrics can be asymptotically matched to each other. By
demanding matching (over a 4-volume in the buffer zone) rather than patching
(choosing a particular 2-surface in the buffer zone), we guarantee that the
errors are small in all zones. The resulting piecewise metric is made formally
$C^\infty$ with smooth transition functions so as to obtain the finite
extrinsic curvature of a 3-slice. In addition to the metric and extrinsic
curvature, we present explicit results for the lapse and the shift, which can
be used as initial data for numerical simulations. This initial data is not
accurate all the way to the asymptotically flat ends inside each hole, and
therefore must be used with evolution codes which employ black hole excision
rather than puncture methods. This paper lays the foundations of a method that
can be sraightforwardly iterated to obtain initial data to higher perturbative
order.

due to the dynamical breaking of diffeomorphism invariance in the early

consider nonlinear realizations of the group of analytical diffeomorphisms

gravitational fields, such as the affine connection, metric and coordinates,
can all be interpreted as Goldstone fields of the diffeomorphism group. We then
construct a Higgs mechanism for gravity in which an affine spacetime evolves
into a Riemannian one by the condensation of a metric. The symmetry breaking
potential is identical to that of hybrid inflation but with the non-inflaton
scalar extended to a symmetric second rank tensor. This tensor is required for
the realization of the metric as a Higgs field. We finally comment on the role
of Goldstone coordinates as a dynamical fluid of reference.

manifold M. Extending to formal linear combinations x=Sum_i(a_i M_i) yields a
sesquilinear pairing p=<,> with values in (formal linear combinations of)
closed manifolds. Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) represents this
universal pairing p onto a finite dimensional quotient pairing q with values in
C which in physically motivated cases is positive definite. To see if such a
""unitary"" TQFT can potentially detect any nontrivial x, we ask if <x,x> is
non-zero whenever x is non-zero. If this is the case, we call the pairing p
positive. The question arises for each dimension d=0,1,2,.... We find p(d)
positive for d=0,1, and 2 and not positive for d=4. We conjecture that p(3) is
also positive. Similar questions may be phrased for (manifold, submanifold)
pairs and manifolds with other additional structure. The results in dimension 4
imply that unitary TQFTs cannot distinguish homotopy equivalent simply
connected 4-manifolds, nor can they distinguish smoothly s-cobordant
4-manifolds. This may illuminate the difficulties that have been met by several
authors in their attempts to formulate unitary TQFTs for d=3+1. There is a
further physical implication of this paper. Whereas 3-dimensional Chern-Simons
theory appears to be well-encoded within 2-dimensional quantum physics, eg in
the fractional quantum Hall effect, Donaldson-Seiberg-Witten theory cannot be
captured by a 3-dimensional quantum system. The positivity of the physical
Hilbert spaces means they cannot see null vectors of the universal pairing;
such vectors must map to zero.

  the likelihoods",,,,"math.ST math.PR q-fin.ST stat.TH",,"  In a series of recent papers Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard introduce an
attractive class of continuous time stochastic volatility models for financial

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck(OU) processes. This models are known to be substantially
more flexible than Gaussian based models. One current problem of this approach
is the unavailability of a tractable exact analysis of likelihood based
stochastic volatility models for the returns of log prices of stocks.
  With this point in mind, the likelihood models of Barndorff-Nielsen and
Shephard are viewed as members of a much larger class of models. That is
likelihoods based on n conditionally independent Normal random variables whose
mean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a common
unobserved Poisson random measure. The analysis of these models is facilitated
by applying the methods in James (2005, 2002), in particular an Esscher type
transform of Poisson random measures; in conjunction with a special case of the
Weber-Sonine formula. It is shown that the marginal likelihood may be expressed
in terms of a multidimensional Fourier-cosine transform. This yields tractable
forms of the likelihood and also allows a full Bayesian posterior analysis of
the integrated volatility process. A general formula for the posterior density
of the log price given the observed data is derived, which could potentially
have applications to option pricing. We extend the models to include leverage
effects in section 5. It is shown that inference does not necessarily require
simulation of random measures. Rather, classical numerical integration can be
used in the most general cases.

  Volatility Likelihood Models",,,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH",,"  This paper discusses and analyzes a class of likelihood models which are
based on two distributional innovations in financial models for stock returns.
That is, the notion that the marginal distribution of aggregate returns of
log-stock prices are well approximated by generalized hyperbolic distributions,
and that volatility clustering can be handled by specifying the integrated
volatility as a random process such as that proposed in a recent series of
papers by Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS). The BNS models produce
likelihoods for aggregate returns which can be viewed as a subclass of latent
regression models where one has n conditionally independent Normal random
variables whose mean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a
common unobserved Poisson random measure. James (2005b) recently obtains an
exact analysis for such models yielding expressions of the likelihood in terms
of quite tractable Fourier-Cosine integrals. Here, our idea is to analyze a
class of likelihoods, which can be used for similar purposes, but where the
latent regression models are based on n conditionally independent models with
distributions belonging to a subclass of the generalized hyperbolic
distributions and whose corresponding parameters are representable as linear
functionals of a common unobserved Poisson random measure. Our models are
perhaps most closely related to the Normal inverse Gaussian/GARCH/A-PARCH
models of Brandorff-Nielsen (1997) and Jensen and Lunde (2001), where in our
case the GARCH component is replaced by quantities such as INT-OU processes. It
is seen that, importantly, such likelihood models exhibit quite different
features structurally. One nice feature of the model is that it allows for more
flexibility in terms of modelling of external regression parameters.

dynamical behavior in nematic liquid crystal films has allowed to identify most
notably some behavior which was recognized as gluing bifurcations leading to
chaos. This analysis of the data used a comparison with a model for the
transition to chaos via gluing bifurcations in optically excited nematic liquid
crystals previously proposed by G. Demeter and L. Kramer. The model of these
last authors, proposed about twenty years before, does not have the central
symmetry which one would expect for minimal dimensional models for chaos in
nematics in view of the time series. What we show here is that the simplest
truncated normal forms for gluing, with the appropriate symmetry and minimal
dimension, do exhibit time signals that are embarrassingly similar to the ones
found using the above mentioned experimental settings. The gluing bifurcation
scenario itself is only visible in limited parameter ranges and substantial
aspect of the chaos that can be observed is due to other factors. First, out of
the immediate neighborhood of the homoclinic curve, nonlinearity can produce
expansion leading to chaos when combined with the recurrence induced by the
homoclinic behavior. Also, pairs of symmetric homoclinic orbits create extreme
sensitivity to noise, so that when the noiseless approach contains a rich
behavior, minute noise can transform the complex damping into sustained chaos.
Leonid Shil'nikov taught us that combining global considerations and local
spectral analysis near critical points is crucial to understand the
phenomenology associated to homoclinic bifurcations. Here this helps us
construct a phenomenological approach to modeling experiments in nonlinear
dissipative contexts.

and to consider the T=0 $2n-2p$ ($\alpha$-like) correlations as the fundamental
concept, instead of the symmetry energy.
  Subsequently, the symmetry energy is described on the basis of the
$\alpha$-like superfluidity caused by the T=0 $2n-2p$ correlations, in parallel
with the pairing energy described on the basis of the pairing superfluidity.
This re-explanation gives useful insight for understanding the nuclear mass
formula. The origin of the Wigner energy is also explained in an interacting
boson model for the Cooper pairs in the $\alpha$-like superfluid vacuum. Adding
a correction term due to the T=0 $2n-2p$ correlations, which determines the T=0
base level for nuclear masses, can improve the mass formulas in practice.

This theory has exibited, along more than one century, great success in the
treatment of systems where short spatio/temporal correlations dominate. There
are, however, anomalous natural and artificial systems that violate the basic
requirements for its applicability. Different physical entropies, other than
the standard one, appear to be necessary in order to satisfactorily deal with
such anomalies. One of such entropies is $S_q \equiv k (1-\int dx
[f(x)]^q)/(1-q)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$), where the entropic index $q$ is a real
parameter. It has been proposed as the basis for a generalization, referred to
as {\it nonextensive statistical mechanics}, of the $BG$ theory. $S_q$ shares
with $S_{BG}$ four remarkable properties, namely {\it concavity} ($\forall
q>0$), {\it Lesche-stability} ($\forall q>0$), {\it finiteness of the entropy
production per unit time} ($q \in \Re$), and {\it additivity} (for at least a
compact support of $q$ including $q=1$). The simultaneous validity of these
properties suggests that $S_q$ is appropriate for bridging, at a macroscopic
level, with classical thermodynamics itself. In the same natural way that
exponential probability functions arise in the standard context,power-law
tailed distributions, even with exponents {\it out} of the L\'evy range, arise
in the nonextensive framework. In this review, we intend to show that many
processes of interest in economy, for which fat-tailed probability functions

mechanisms that underly the nonextensive theory.

are all small, the average winnings per agent exceed those obtained for either
(1) a pure population where all agents have equal memory-length, or (2) a mixed
population comprising sub-populations of equal-memory agents with each
sub-population having a different memory-length. Agents who consistently play
strategies of a given memory-length, are found to win more on average --
switching between strategies with different memory lengths incurs an effective
penalty, while switching between strategies of equal memory does not. Agents
employing short-memory strategies can outperform agents using long-memory
strategies, even in the regime where an equal-memory system would have favored
the use of long-memory strategies. Using the many-body `Crowd-Anticrowd'

  We compare the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans
with those of closely related species to elucidate the recent evolutionary
history of their respective protein interaction networks. Interaction and
expression data are studied in the light of a detailed phylogenetic analysis.
The underlying network structure is incorporated explicitly into the
statistical analysis.
  The increased phylogenetic resolution, paired with high-quality interaction
data, allows us to resolve the way in which protein interaction network
structure and abundance of proteins affect the evolutionary rate. We find that
expression levels are better predictors of the evolutionary rate than a
protein's connectivity. Detailed analysis of the two organisms also shows that
the evolutionary rates of interacting proteins are not sufficiently similar to
be mutually predictive.
  It appears that meaningful inferences about the evolution of protein
interaction networks require comparative analysis of reasonably closely related
species. The signature of protein evolution is shaped by a protein's abundance
in the organism and its function and the biological process it is involved in.
Its position in the interaction networks and its connectivity may modulate this
but they appear to have only minor influence on a protein's evolutionary rate.

preliminary requisite of quantum computation is the implementation of
controlled logic gates by controlled dynamics of qubits. In controlled

phase, depending on the state of other qubits. If the evolution is geometric,
then the phase acquired depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and
is robust against certain types of errors. This phenomenon leads to an
inherently fault-tolerant quantum computation.

non-Hermitian Witten's hierarchy of solvable Hamiltonians and construct its
first supersymmetric (SUSY) partner in closed form.

allow one to prepare pure superposition states of atoms, using the coherent
population trapping effect. These $m$$-$$m$ states are prepared in the system
of Zeeman substates of the ground-state hyperfine levels with arbitrary angular
momenta $F_1$ and $F_2$. It is established that, in general case $m\ne 0$, the
use of waves with elliptical polarizations ($\epsilon_1$$\perp$$\epsilon_2$
field configuration for alkali metal atoms) is necessary for the pure state
preparation. We analytically show an unique advantage of the D1 line of alkali
metal atoms, which consists in the possibility to generate pure $m$$-$$m$
states even in the absence of spectral resolution of the excited-state
hyperfine levels, contrary to the D2 line.

and a cavity wall are performed in the separation region from 3 nm to 150 nm.
The cases of metastable He${}^{\ast}$ and Na atoms near the metal,
semiconductor or dielectric walls are considered. Different approximations to
the description of wall material and atomic dynamic polarizability are
carefully compared. The smooth transition to the Casimir-Polder interaction is
verified. It is shown that to obtain accurate results for the atom-wall van der
Waals interaction at shortest separations with an error less than 1% one should
use the complete optical tabulated data for the complex refraction index of the
wall material and the accurate dynamic polarizability of an atom. The obtained
results may be useful for the theoretical interpretation of recent experiments
on quantum reflection and Bose-Einstein condensation of ultracold atoms on or
near surfaces of different nature.
