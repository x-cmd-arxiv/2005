of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) and the spectral power law index of
several Black Hole (BH) candidate sources when seen in the low/hard state, the
steep power-law (soft) state, and in transition between these states. In the
soft state these index-QPO frequency correlations show a saturation of the
photon index about 2.7 at high values of the low frequency. This saturation
effect was previously identified as a black hole signature. In this paper we
argue that this saturation does not occur, at least for one neutron star (NS)
source 4U 1728-34, for which the index monotonically increases with the low
frequency to the values of 6 and higher. We base this conclusion on our
analysis about 1.5 Msec of RXTE archival data for 4U 1728-34. We reveal the
spectral evolution of the Comptonized blackbody spectra when the source
transitions from the hard to soft states. The hard state spectrum is a typical
thermal Comptonization spectrum of the soft photons which originate in the disk
and the NS outer photospheric layers. The hard state photon index is about 2.
The soft state spectrum consists of two blackbody components which are only
slightly Comptonized. Thus we can claim (as expected from theory) that in NS
sources thermal equilibrium is established for the soft state. To the contrary
in BH sources, the equilibrium is never established due to the presence of the
BH horizon. The emergent BH spectrum, even in the high/soft state, has a power
law component. We also show that the presence of Fe K_alpha emission-line
strengths, QPOs, and the link between them does not depend on radio flux in 4U
1728-34.

direct observation of the birthplaces of open clusters of stars in the galactic
disk as a function of their age. Our measurement does not depend on any
specific model of the spiral structure, like the existence of a given number of
spiral arms, or the presence of a bar in the central regions. This study became
possible due to the recent completion of a large database on open clusters by
our group. The birthplaces of the clusters are determined by two methods, one
that assumes that the orbits are circular, and the other by integrating the
orbits in the Galactic potential for a time equal to the age of the clusters.
We selected in the database a sample of 212 clusters for which proper motions,
radial velocities, distances and ages are available, or of 612 clusters that
have ages and distances available. We tested different assumptions concerning
the rotation curve and the radius $R_0$ of the solar orbit. Our results confirm
that a dominant fraction of the open clusters are formed in spiral arms, and
that the spiral arms rotate like a rigid body, as predicted by the classical
theory of spiral waves. We find that the corotation radius $R_c$ is close to
the solar galactic orbit ($R_c/R_0 = 1.08 \pm 0.08$). This proximity has many
potentially interesting consequences, like a better preservation of life on the
Earth, and a new understanding of the history of star formation in the solar
neighborhood, and of the evolution of the abundance of elements in the galactic

purpose. This filter is combined with the standard Johnson-Kron-Cousins B, V,
and I bandpasses to constitute the uBVI photometric system.
  Model stellar atmospheres are used to calibrate color-color diagrams for the
uBVI system in terms of the fundamental stellar parameters of effective
temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. The u-B index is very sensitive
to log g, but also to [Fe/H]. It is shown that an analog of the Str\""omgren c_1
index, defined as (u-B)-(B-V), is much less metallicity dependent, but still
sensitive to log g. The effect of interstellar reddening on u-B is determined
through synthetic photometric calculations, and practical advice is given on
dealing with flat fields, atmospheric extinction, the red leak in the u filter,
and photometric reductions.
  The uBVI system offers a wide range of applicability in detecting stars of
high luminosity in both young (yellow supergiants) and old (post-AGB stars)
populations, using stars of both types as standard candles to measure
extragalactic distances with high efficiency, and in exploring the horizontal
branch in globular clusters. In many stellar applications, it can profitably
replace the classical uBVI system.

lines but without any [OII] nor H$\alpha$ emission lines. The existence of
strong Balmer absorption lines indicates that E+A galaxies have experienced
starburst within recent one Gyr. However, the lack of [OII] and H$\alpha$
emission lines indicates that E+A galaxies do not have any on-going star
formation. Therefore, E+A galaxies are interpreted as a post-starburst galaxy.
For many years, however, it has been a mystery why E+A galaxies started
starburst and why they quenched the star formation abruptly.
  Using one of the largest samples of 266 E+A galaxies carefully selected from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2, we have investigated the
environment of E+A galaxies from 50 kpc to 8 Mpc scale, i.e., from a typical
distance to satellite galaxies to the scale of large scale structures. We found
that E+A galaxies have excess of local galaxy density only at a scale of $<100$
kpc (with a two $\sigma$ significance), but not at the cluster scale ($\sim$1.5
Mpc) nor in the scale of large scale structure ($\sim$8 Mpc). These results
indicate that E+A galaxies are not created by the physical mechanisms
associated with galaxy clusters or the large scale structure, but are likely to
be created by the dynamical interaction with closely accompanying galaxies at a
$<$100 kpc scale. The claim is also supported by the morphology of E+A
galaxies. We have found that almost all E+A galaxies have a bright compact
core, and that $\sim$30% of E+A galaxies have dynamically disturbed signatures
or the tidal tails, being quite suggestive of morphological appearance of
merger/interaction remnants.

However, it has been difficult to identify the origin of the cluster galaxy
evolution. Here we show that gravitational interaction/friction between
galaxies is the statistically dominant physical mechanism responsible for the
cluster galaxy evolution, and that the well-favored ram-pressure stripping by
the cluster gas is not statistically driving the cluster galaxy evolution.
  We have constructed the largest composite cluster with 14548 member galaxies
out of 335 clusters with ~>300 km/s carefully selected from the SDSS. By
measuring velocity dispersions of various subsamples of galaxies in this
composite cluster, we found that bright cluster galaxies (Mz<-23) have
significantly smaller velocity dispersion than faint galaxies (Mz>-23). We
interpret this as direct evidence of the dynamical interaction/friction between
cluster galaxies, where massive galaxies lose their velocity through the energy
equipartition during the dynamical interaction/friction with less massive
galaxies. We also found that star-forming late-type galaxies have a larger
velocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies. This is inconsistent with
the ram-pressure stripping model; since the ram-pressure is proportional to
sigma v^2 (i.e., stronger for galaxies with high velocity), the ram-pressure
stripping cannot explain the observed trends of passive (evolved) galaxies
having low velocity rather than high velocity. On the other hand, the result is
again consistent with the dynamical galaxy-galaxy interaction/friction, where
more evolved (passive) galaxies lose their velocity through dynamical
interaction/friction.

period and contain spikes of light with the 8-day period; maxima do not show
this short period. The system typically shows maxima to be redder than minima.

star peers through the three equi- spaced separations between the four sectors
producing the 8-day period. The remainder of the disk contains hydrogen in
emission making maxima appear redder. A companion star of lower mass in an
inclined and highly eccentric orbit produces an impulsive perturbation near its

100 Mpc (co-moving) deep spanning the redshift range 2.9<z<3.4 based on
Bayesian photometric redshifts that include the I magnitude as a prior. The
slice width (100 Mpc) corresponds to the photometric redshift accuracy
(\Delta_z\sim 0.15).
  We used mock catalogs from the GIF2 cosmological simulations to show that
this redshift resolution is sufficient to statistically differentiate the high
density regions from the low density regions using $\Sigma_5$, the projected
density to the 5th nearest neighbor. These mock catalogs have a redshift depth
of 100 Mpc, similar to our slice width.
  The large area of the MOSAIC images, 40x40 Mpc (co-moving) per field, allows
us to measure the SFR from the dust-corrected UV continuum as a function of
$\Sigma_5$. In contrast to low-redshift galaxies, we find that the SFR (or UV
luminosity) of LBGs at z=3 shows no detectable dependence on environment over 2
orders of magnitude in density.
  To test the significance of our result, we use Monte Carlo simulations (from
the mock catalogs) and the same projected density estimators we applied to our
data. We find that we can reject the steep z=0 SFR-density at the 5-$\sigma$
level. We conclude that the SFR-density at z=3 must be at least 3.6 times
flatter than it is locally, i.e. the SFR of LBGs is significantly less
dependent on environment than the SFR of local star-forming galaxies. We find

properties (ages, metallicities and $\alpha$-element enhancements) and allowed
a comparison with the parameters determined for a sample of galaxies in lower
density environments, studied by Gonz\'alez (1993). The stellar population
parameters were derived by comparison to single stellar population models of
Thomas et al. (2003) and to a new set of SSP models for the indices Mg$_2$,
Fe5270 and Fe5335 based on synthetic spetra. These models, based on an update
version of the fitting functions presented in Barbuy et al. (2003), are fully

values for the metallicities and [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, (2) the majority of the
galaxies in compact groups seem to be old (median age of 14 Gyr for eight
galaxies for which ages could be derived), in agreement with recent work by
Proctor et al. (2004). These findings support two possible scenarios: compact
groups are either young systems whose members have recently assembled and had
not enough time to experience any merging yet or, instead, they are old systems

$\Omega=1$. This is exactly what is considered in inflationary scenario to

real systems as diverse as the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the Internet, energy
landscapes, biological and social networks
\cite{ab-review,mendes,vespignani,newman,amaral}. A large number of real
networks are called ``scale-free'' because they show a power-law distribution
of the number of links per node \cite{ab-review,barabasi1999,faloutsos}.
However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not {\it length-scale}
invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the ``small-world''
property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases
exponentially with the ``diameter'' of the network
\cite{erdos,bollobas,milgram,watts}, rather than the power-law relation
expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel
approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is
indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a
renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing
nodes within a given ""size"". Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation
between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box
defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which
are shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction
networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in
complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse
networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together
previously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with
renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.

building accurate network models and designing efficient algorithms for
Internet applications. Yet, obtaining its graph structure is a surprisingly
difficult task, as edges cannot be explicitly queried. Instead, empirical
studies rely on traceroutes to build what are essentially single-source,
all-destinations, shortest-path trees. These trees only sample a fraction of
the network's edges, and a recent paper by Lakhina et al. found empirically
that the resuting sample is intrinsically biased. For instance, the observed
degree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even when
the underlying degree distribution is Poisson.
  In this paper, we study the bias of traceroute sampling systematically, and,
for a very general class of underlying degree distributions, calculate the
likely observed distributions explicitly. To do this, we use a continuous-time
realization of the process of exposing the BFS tree of a random graph with a
given degree distribution, calculate the expected degree distribution of the
tree, and show that it is sharply concentrated. As example applications of our
machinery, we show how traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributions
in both delta-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs. Thus, our work
puts the observations of Lakhina et al. on a rigorous footing, and extends them
to nearly arbitrary degree distributions.

popularity significantly influence the ranking of search results by modern
search engines. The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with
quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly.
Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for
newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits and/or in-links.
Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search
engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few
results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively ``shut out,'' and
it can take a very long time before they become popular.
  We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem: the introduction of
a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so
offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much
randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence
there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages
and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this
tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic
objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We
show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.

the gravitational collapse of uniformly rotating neutron stars to black holes
in fully three-dimensional simulations. The initial stellar models are
relativistic polytropes which are dynamically unstable and with angular
velocities ranging from slow rotation to the mass-shedding limit. An essential
aspect of these simulations is the use of progressive mesh-refinement
techniques which allow to move the outer boundaries of the computational domain
to regions where gravitational radiation attains its asymptotic form. The
waveforms have been extracted using a gauge-invariant approach in which the
numerical spacetime is matched with the non-spherical perturbations of a
Schwarzschild spacetime. Overall, the results indicate that the waveforms have
features related to the properties of the initial stellar models (in terms of
their w-mode oscillations) and of the newly produced rotating black holes (in
terms of their quasi-normal modes). While our waveforms are in good qualitative
agreement with those computed by Stark and Piran in two-dimensional
simulations, our amplitudes are about one order of magnitude smaller and this
difference is mostly likely due to our less severe pressure reduction. For a
neutron star rotating uniformly near mass-shedding and collapsing at 10 kpc,
the signal-to-noise ratio computed uniquely from the burst is S/N ~ 0.25, but

the contrary, due to this effect, the description of solar neutrino data
worsens for large absolute mass. As a consequence a lower bound on the level of
degeneracy can be derived from the combined analysis of the solar and KamLAND

Condensate dynamics, characterized by the energy density scaling like $\epsilon

of the quark-gluon plasma with $\epsilon \sim 1/\tau^{4/3}$ (or higher power of
$1/\tau$ for the boost non-invariant case). We argue that, at any order of the
perturbative expansion in the QCD coupling constant, the gluon field generated
in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision leads to energy density scaling as
$\epsilon \sim 1/\tau$ for late times $\tau \gg 1/Q_s$. Therefore it is likely
that thermalization and hydrodynamic description of the gluon system produced
in heavy ion collisions can not result from perturbative QCD diagrams at these
late times. At earlier times with $\tau \sim 1/Q_s$ the subleading corrections
to $\epsilon$ in $1/\tau$ expansion (terms scaling like $\sim
1/\tau^{1+\Delta}$ with $\Delta >0$) may become important possibly leading to
hydrodynamic-like behavior of the gluon system. Still, we show that such
corrections do not contribute to the particle production cross section, and are
likely to be irrelevant for physical observables. We generalize our results by
including massless quarks into the system. Thus, it appears that the apparent
thermalization of quarks and gluons, leading to success of Bjorken
hydrodynamics in describing heavy ion collisions at RHIC, can only be
attributed to the non-perturbative QCD effects.

reinforces these results. Several classes of noncommutative inflationary models

regimes. Finally, we establish dual relations between inflationary,
cyclic/ekpyrotic and phantom cosmologies, as well as between scalar-driven and
tachyon-driven cosmologies. The exact dualities relating the four-dimensional

suggested by the index theorem, contrary to previous examples of BPS solitons.
We investigate BPS wall solutions in an explicit example of M using Abelian
gauge theory. Its Higgs branch turns out to contain several special Lagrangian
submanifolds including M. We show that the total moduli space of BPS walls is
the union of these submanifolds. We also find interesting dynamics between BPS
walls as a byproduct of the analysis. Namely, mutual repulsion and attraction
between BPS walls sometimes forbid a movement of a wall and lock it in a
certain position; we also find that a pair of walls can transmute to another
pair of walls with different tension after they pass through.

If $H\subset G$ is a connected, $\theta$-stable, semisimple subgroup, for each

$j_g \colon S(H,g)\to S$ induced by the map $H({\Bbb A})\to G({\Bbb A}),

$S(H,g)$ are compact. Then, for each positive integer $k$, the map $j_g$
induces a restriction map $$R_g \colon H^{k}(S, {\Bbb C})\to H^{k}(S(H,g),
{\Bbb C}).$$ In this paper we focus on symmetric spaces associated to the
unitary and orthogonal groups, namely $O(p,q)$ and $U(p,q)$, and give explicit
criterions for the injectivity of the product of the maps $R_g$ (for $g$
running through $G({\Bbb Q})$) when restricted to the strongly primitive (in

  The results we obtain fit into a larger conjectural picture that we describe
and which bare a strong analogy with the classical Lefschetz Theorems. This may
sound quite surprising that such an analogy still exists in the case of the
real arithmetic manifolds. We finally derive some applications concerning the
non vanishing of some cohomology classes in arithmetic manifolds.

digital signal or image) from incomplete and contaminated observations y = A
x_0 + e; A is a n by m matrix with far fewer rows than columns (n << m) and e
is an error term. Is it possible to recover x_0 accurately based on the data y?
  To recover x_0, we consider the solution x* to the l1-regularization problem
min \|x\|_1 subject to \|Ax-y\|_2 <= epsilon, where epsilon is the size of the
error term e. We show that if A obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with
unit-normed columns) and if the vector x_0 is sufficiently sparse, then the
solution is within the noise level \|x* - x_0\|_2 \le C epsilon.
  As a first example, suppose that A is a Gaussian random matrix, then stable
recovery occurs for almost all such A's provided that the number of nonzeros of
x_0 is of about the same order as the number of observations. Second, suppose
one observes few Fourier samples of x_0, then stable recovery occurs for almost
any set of p coefficients provided that the number of nonzeros is of the order
of n/[\log m]^6. In the case where the error term vanishes, the recovery is of
course exact, and this work actually provides novel insights on the exact
recovery phenomenon discussed in earlier papers. The methodology also explains
why one can also very nearly recover approximately sparse signals.

classical theory in which $\cM$ is simply $\R^n$. In this note, we mainly
restrict our attention to the case that $\cM$ is a planar curve $\cC$. A
complete Hausdorff dimension theory is established for the sets $ \cC \cap
\cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2) $ and $ \cC \cap \cSM_2(\psi) $. A divergent Khintchine
type result is obtained for $\cC \cap \cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2) $; i.e. if a certain
sum diverges then the one--dimensional Lebesgue measure on $\cC$ of $\cC \cap
\cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2) $ is full. Furthermore, in the case that $\cC$ is a
rational quadric the convergent Khintchine type result is obtained for both
types of approximation. Our results for $\cC \cap \cS_2(\psi_1,\psi_2) $
naturally generalize the dimension and Lebesgue measure statements of
\cite{BDV03}. Within the multiplicative framework, our results for $ \cC \cap
\cSM_2(\psi)$ constitute the first of their type.

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen and supplemented by classical communication,
which correctly reproduces the quantum-mechanical predictions for measurements
of all products of Pauli operators on an n-qubit GHZ state (or ``cat state'').
The n-2 bits employed by our model are shown to be optimal for the allowed set
of measurements, demonstrating that the required communication overhead scales
linearly with n. We formulate a connection between the generation of the local
values utilized by our model and the stabilizer formalism, which leads us to
conjecture that a generalization of this method will shed light on the content
of the Gottesman-Knill theorem.

was developed. This system uses a commercially available 200-mm-diameter
silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) and an in-house-developed ultralow-noise
readout circuit, which are both cooled to 77 K. When the APD operates at a low
gain of about 10, it has a high-linearity response to the number of incident
photons and a low excess noise factor. The APD also has high quantum efficiency
and a dark current of less than 1 e/s at 77 K. This photodetection system will
shorten the measurement time and enable higher spatial and wavelength
resolution for near-field scanning optical microscopes.

two-mode \textit{Gaussian} squeezed vacuum states with beam splitters and
on-off type photon detectors, with which \textit{mixed non-Gaussian} states are
generally obtained in the conditional process. It is known that the
entanglement can be enhanced via this non-Gaussian operation on the two-mode
squeezed vacuum state. We show that, in the range of practical squeezing
parameters, the conditional outputs are still close to Gaussian states, but
their second order variances of quantum fluctuations and correlations are
effectively suppressed and enhanced, respectively. To investigate an
operational meaning of these states, especially entangled states, we also
evaluate the quantum dense coding scheme from the viewpoint of the mutual
information, and we show that non-Gaussian entangled state can be advantageous
compared with the original two-mode squeezed state.

complex, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. As a complex manifold, the latter
admits a continuum of nonequivalent, complex-differentiable structures that can
be placed in 1-to-1 correspondence with families of coherent states in the
Hilbert space of quantum states. The moduli space of nonbiholomorphic complex
structures on classical phase space turns out to be an infinite-dimensional
symmetric space. We argue that each choice of a complex differentiable
structure gives rise to a physically different notion of an elementary quantum.
