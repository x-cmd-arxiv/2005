transit method, will a fortiori also be able to detect the transit of
artificial planet-size objects. Multiple artificial objects would produce
lightcurves easily distinguishable from natural transits. If only one
artificial object transits, detecting its artificial nature becomes more
difficult. We discuss the case of three different objects (triangle, 2-screen,
louver-like 6-screen) and show that they have a transit lightcurve
distinguishable from the transit of natural planets, either spherical or
oblate, although an ambiguity with the transit of a ringed planet exists in
some cases. We show that transits, especially in the case of multiple
artificial objects, could be used for the emission of attention-getting
signals, with a sky coverage comparable to the laser pulse method. The large
number of expected planets (several hundreds) to be discovered by the transit
method by next space missions will allow to test these ideas.

and Kolb et al. (hep-th/0503117) that the acceleration of the universe could be
explained by large superhorizon fluctuations generated by inflation. We show
that no acceleration can be produced by this mechanism. We begin by showing how
the application of Raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies results
in several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. Next we derive an
exact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which
application of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the
exact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the
discrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the Kolb
et al. analysis. We proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation of
general relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observable
effects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. By constructing a
Riemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrared
divergence terms arise in this coordinate system. Thus any divergences found
previously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and are
unobservable. We perform an explicit analysis of the variance of the
deceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usual
coordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by Barausse et al.
and Kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in their
analysis. Finally, we argue that introducing isocurvature perturbations does
not alter our conclusion that the accelerating expansion of the universe cannot
be explained by superhorizon modes.

series of large N-body simulations of the $\Lambda$CDM and SCDM models that
have evolved 1.1 or 8.6 billion particles, are used in the study. Evolution of
the genus statistic, used as a topology measure, from redshift 8 to 0 is
accurately calculated over a wide range of smoothing scales using the
simulations. The tracers of large scale structure considered are the CDM
matter, biased peaks in the initial density field, dark halos, and `galaxies'
populating the dark halos in accordance with a Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) model.
  We have found that the effects of biasing, gravitational evolution, and
initial conditions on topology of large scale structure are all comparable. The
redshift space distortion effects are relatively small down to about 5
$h^{-1}$Mpc for all tracers except for the high threshold part of the genus
curve. The gravitational effects are found to be well-modeled by the analytic
perturbation theory when the CDM matter distribution is considered. But the
direction of gravitational evolution of topology can be even reversed for
different tracers. For example, the shift parameter of the genus curve evolves
in opposite directions for matter and HOD `galaxies' at large scales. At small
scales there are interesting deviations of the genus curve of dark halos and
`galaxies' from that of matter in our initially Gaussian simulations. The
deviations should be understood as due to combined effects of gravitational
evolution and biasing.

formed by major galaxy merging have positive radial color gradients and
negative radial H$\delta$ gradients by virtue of their central poststarburst
populations. Furthermore, we show that the projected kinematical and
spectroscopic properties of the simulated E+A galaxies can be remarkably
different for different major merger models. For example, the simulated E+A
ellipticals with kinematically decoupled cores clearly show regions of strong
H$\delta$ absorption which are very flattened, with differences in rotation and
velocity dispersion between the old and young stars. E+A ellipticals are highly
likely to show more rapid rotation and a smaller central velocity dispersion in

structural and evolutionary parameters with age and Galactocentric distance.
The main results for the present sample are: {\em (i)} cluster size correlates
both with age and Galactocentric distance; {\em (ii)} because of size and mass
scaling, core and limiting radii, and core and overall mass correlate; {\em
(iii)} massive ($\rm m\geq1 000$ \ms) and less-massive clusters follow separate
correlation paths on the plane core radius and overall mass; {\em (iv)} MF
slopes of massive clusters are restricted to a narrow range, while those of the
less-massive ones distribute over a wider range. Core and overall MF flattening
is related to the ratio ($\tau$) of age to relaxation time. For large values of
$\tau$ the effects of large-scale mass segregation and low-mass stars
evaporation can be observed in the MFs. In this sense, $\tau$ appears to
characterize the evolutionary state of the clusters. We conclude that
appreciable slope flattenings in the overall MFs of the less-massive clusters
take $\sim6$ times longer to occur than in the core, while in the massive
clusters they take a time $\sim13$ times longer. We investigate cluster
parameters equivalent to those determining the fundamental plane of

a previous paper,we obtained solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes coupled
equations, describing a trapped Fermi superfluid ga s. Using these Bogoliubov
quasi-particle excitations, we calculate the density correlation function in
the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov generalized random phase approximation (HFB-GRPA).
Previous discussions of collective modes were based on solving the T=0 equation
of motion for the superfluid in a trap, ignoring the effect of single-particle
excitations. We determine the frequencies of the quadrupole and the monopole
modes. In the crossover region, the frequencies of these two modes are shown to
be stro ngly depressed by the threshold energy of the two-particle continuum,
originating from Andreev single-particle bound states (or in-gap states)
localized at the edge of the trap. This effect becomes less important as one
enters the BEC regime, due to the absence of these low energy fermion bound
states. This suppression of collective mode frequencies by the two-particle
continuum may be a useful experimental signature of the single-particle energy
gap in the crossover region of trapped Fermi superfluids.

communities (e.g. newsgroups, BBS, forums, interest clubs), are dynamical
systems in nature. As peers get in and out of the system, the information
content made available by the prevailing membership varies continually in
amount as well as composition, which in turn affects all peers' join/leave
decisions. As a result, the dynamics of membership and information content are
strongly coupled, suggesting interesting issues about growth, sustenance and
stability.
  In this paper, we propose to study such communities with a simple statistical
model of an information sharing club. Carrying their private payloads of
information goods as potential supply to the club, peers join or leave on the
basis of whether the information they demand is currently available.
Information goods are chunked and typed, as in a file sharing system where
peers contribute different files, or a forum where messages are grouped by
topics or threads. Peers' demand and supply are then characterized by
statistical distributions over the type domain.
  This model reveals interesting critical behaviour with multiple equilibria. A
sharp growth threshold is derived: the club may grow towards a sustainable
equilibrium only if the value of an order parameter is above the threshold, or
shrink to emptiness otherwise. The order parameter is composite and comprises
the peer population size, the level of their contributed supply, the club's
efficiency in information search, the spread of supply and demand over the type
domain, as well as the goodness of match between them.

extraction of the glueball masses of 4-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory
in the Hamiltonian limit, where the temporal lattice spacing is zero. By taking
into account the renormalization of both the anisotropy and the Euclidean
coupling, we calculate the string tension and masses of the scalar, axial
vector and tensor states using standard Wilson action on increasingly
anisotropic lattices, and make an extrapolation to the Hamiltonian limit. The
results are compared with estimates from various other Hamiltonian and
Euclidean studies. We find that more accurate determination of the glueball
masses and the mass ratios has been achieved and the results are a significant
improvement upon previous Hamiltonian estimates. The continuum predictions are
then found by extrapolation of results obtained from smallest values of spatial
lattice spacing. For the lightest scalar, tensor and axial vector states we
obtain masses of $m_{0^{++}}=1654 \pm 83$ MeV, $m_{2^{++}}=2272\pm 115$ MeV and
$m_{1^{+-}}=2940\pm 165$ MeV, respectively. These are consistent with the
estimates obtained in the previous studies in the Euclidean limit. The
consistency is a clear evidence of universality between Euclidean and
Hamiltonian formulations. From the accuracy of our estimates, we conclude that
the standard Euclidean Monte Carlo method is a reliable technique for obtaining
results in the Hamiltonian version of the theory, just as in Euclidean case.

show that an obstruction to the linearizability is the cohomology class of a
Casimir 2-cocycle. This allows us to obtain a semilocal analog of the Conn
linearization theorem and to clarify examples of nonlinearizable Poisson
structures due to \cite{DW}.

with a white-noise potential in order to shed light on two issues: the rate of
spread and the singularity formation in the average sense. Our main tools are
the energy law and the variance identity. The method is completely elementary.
  For the problem of wave spread, we show that the ensemble-averaged dispersion
in the critical or defocusing case follows the cubic-in-time law while in the
supercritical and subcritical focusing cases the cubic law becomes an upper and
lower bounds respectively.
  We have also found that in the critical and supercritical focusing cases the
presence of a white-noise random potential results in different conditions for
singularity-with-positive-probability from the homogeneous case but does not
prevent singularity formation. We show that in the supercritical focusing case
the ensemble-averaged self-interaction energy and the momentum variance can
exceed any fixed level in a finite time with positive probability.

recipe by changing either the dimensions of the cake or the amount of cake
batter alters the baking time. Restricting our consideration to the genoise,
one of the basic cakes of classic French cuisine, we have obtained a
semi-empirical formula for its baking time as a function of oven temperature,
initial temperature of the cake batter, and dimensions of the unbaked cake. The
formula, which is based on the Diffusion equation, has three adjustable
parameters whose values are estimated from data obtained by baking genoises in
cylindrical pans of various diameters. The resulting formula for the baking
time exhibits the scaling behavior typical of diffusion processes, i.e. the
baking time is proportional to the (characteristic length scale)^2 of the cake.
It also takes account of evaporation of moisture at the top surface of the
cake, which appears to be a dominant factor affecting the baking time of a
cake. In solving this problem we have obtained solutions of the Diffusion
equation which are interpreted naturally and straightforwardly in the context
of heat transfer; however, when interpreted in the context of the Schrodinger
equation, they are somewhat peculiar. The solutions describe a system whose
mass assumes different values in two different regions of space. Furthermore,
the solutions exhibit characteristics similar to the evanescent modes
associated with light waves propagating in a wave guide. When we consider the
Schrodinger equation as a non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation
so that it includes a mass term, these are no longer solutions.
