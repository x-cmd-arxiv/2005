carried by fast rotation on the observed spectra of early-type stars. Stars are
assumed to be in rigid rotation and the grid of plane-parallel model
atmospheres used to represent the gravitational darkening are calculated by
means of a non-LTE approach. Attention is paid on the relation between the
apparent and parent non-rotating counterpart stellar fundamental parameters and
apparent and true vsini parameters as a function of the rotation rate
Omega/Omega_c, stellar mass and inclination angle. It is shown that omission of
gravitational darkening in the analysis of chemical abundances of CNO elements
can produce systematic overestimation or underestimation, depending on the
lines used, rotational rate and inclination angle. The proximity of Be stars to
the critical rotation is re-discussed by correcting not only the vsini of 130
Be stars, but also their effective temperature and gravity to account for
stellar rotationally induced geometrical distortion and for the concomitant
gravitational darkening effect. We concluded that the increase of the vsini
estimate is accompanied by an even higher value of the stellar equatorial
critical velocity, so that the most probable average rate of angular velocity
of Be stars attains Omega/Omega_c ~ 0.88.

(GRB) jet attributes is the prompt gamma-ray emission, in which several
intrinsic and extrinsic variables determine GRB pulse evolution. Bright,
usually complex bursts have many narrow pulses that are difficult to model due
to overlap. However, the relatively simple, long spectral lag, wide-pulse
bursts may have simpler physics and are easier to model. In this work we
analyze the temporal and spectral behavior of wide pulses in 24 long-lag
bursts, using a pulse model with two shape parameters -- width and asymmetry --
and the Band spectral model with three shape parameters. We find that pulses in
long-lag bursts are distinguished both temporally and spectrally from those in
bright bursts: the pulses in long spectral lag bursts are few in number, and ~
100 times wider (10s of seconds), have systematically lower peaks in nu*F(nu),
harder low-energy spectra and softer high-energy spectra. We find that these
five pulse descriptors are essentially uncorrelated for our long-lag sample,
suggesting that at least five parameters are needed to model burst temporal and
spectral behavior. However, pulse width is strongly correlated with spectral
lag; hence these two parameters may be viewed as mutual surrogates. We infer
that accurate formulations for estimating GRB luminosity and total energy will
depend on several gamma-ray attributes, at least for long-lag bursts. The
prevalence of long-lag bursts near the BATSE trigger threshold, their
predominantly low nF(n) spectral peaks, and relatively steep upper power-law
spectral indices indicate that Swift will detect many such bursts.

sharp contrast to the overall distributions of dark matter in the halo and of
subhalos within it which, although triaxial, are not highly aspherical. We find
that the spatial distribution of satellites is significantly different from

subhalos that had the most massive progenitors at earlier times. The elongated
disk-like structure delineated by the satellites has its long axis aligned with
the major axis of the dark matter halo. We interpret our results as reflecting
the preferential infall of satellites along the spines of a few filaments of

These ``Hdelta-strong'', or HDS, galaxies have undergone a recent and rapid

Deep and the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys to make mass-matched samples
(M*>=10^10.2 Msun), with 25 and 50,255 galaxies, respectively), we find that
the fraction of galaxies in an HDS phase has decreased from about 50% at z=1.2
to a few percent today. This decrease in fraction is due to an actual decrease
in the number density of massive HDS systems by a factor of 2-4, coupled with
an increase in the number density of massive galaxies by about 30 percent. We
show that this result depends only weakly on the threshold chosen for the
Hdelta equivalent width to define HDS systems (if greater than 4 A) and
corresponds to a (1+z)^{2.5\pm 0.7} evolution. Spectral synthesis studies of
the high-redshift population using the PEGASE code, treating Hdelta_A, EW[OII],
Dn4000, and rest-frame colors, favor models in which the Balmer absorption
features in massive Hdelta-strong systems are the echoes of intense episodes of
star-formation that faded about 1 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation. The
z=1.4-2 epoch appears to correspond to a time at which massive galaxies are in
transition from a mode of sustained star formation to a relatively quiescent
mode with weak and rare star-formation episodes. We argue that the most likely
local descendants of the distant massive HDS galaxies are passively evolving
massive galaxies in the field and small groups.

to make B and K-band mock images. Dust absorption is also included. We discuss
the advantages and drawbacks of each method, the effects of projection and
resolution, as well as the uncertainties introduced by the presence of dust.
The use of N-body simulations allows us to compare the location of Ultra
Harmonic Resonance (UHR or 4/1) and corotation (CR) with measured bar lengths.
We show that the minimum of ellipticity located just outside the bulk of the
bar is correlated with the corotation, whereas the location of the UHR can be
approximated using the phase of the fitted ellipses or the phase of the m=2
Fourier development of the surface brightness. We give evidence that the
classification of slow/fast bars, based on the ratio R = Rcr/Rbar could
increase from 1 (fast bar) to 1.4 (slow bar) just by a change of method. We
thus conclude that one has to select the right bar-length estimator depending

of solar protons between 2 and 2000 MeV from the Sun to the Earth, for several
assumptions regarding interplanetary scattering and the duration of particle
injection, and analyzing the results using the inverse velocity fit. We find
that in most cases, the onset times align close to a straight line as a
function of inverse velocity. Despite this, the estimated injection time can be
in error by several minutes. Also, the estimated path length can deviate
greatly from the actual path length along the interplanetary magnetic field.
The major difference between the estimated and actual path lengths implies that

thermally unstable helium burning. Our global result is that the new triple
alpha rate has no significant influence on such stars, but that there is a
noticable, though small, effect of the new 14N(p,gamma)15O rate, in particular
on the core helium flash and the blue loop during core helium burning in the

comprises a total of 21 (19 serendipitous + 2 target) extended X-ray sources to
the limit f(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs with a high probability (> 99.9%) of
being extended on the XMM-Newton images. Of the 21 cluster candidates 7 are
spectroscopically confirmed in the literature. Exploiting the optical data
available for these fields we discover that 68% of the X-ray cluster candidates
are associated with optical galaxy overdensities. We also attempt to constrain
the redshifts of our cluster candidates using photometric methods. We thus
construct the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of
each X-ray selected cluster candidate and search for statistically significant
redshift peaks against that of the background distribution of field galaxies.
Comparison of the photometric with spectroscopic redshift estimates for the
confirmed clusters suggest that our simple method is robust out to z~0.5. For
clusters at higher z, deeper optical data are required to estimate reliable
photometric redshifts. Finally, using the sample of the 19 serendipitous X-ray
selected cluster candidates we estimate their surface density down to
f(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs and find it to be in fair agreement with previous
and recent studies.

directional emission by a central absorber, and apply it to the pulsar
magnetosphere. The model assumes the radially extended inward radio emission
along the local direction of the magnetic field, and the pulsar as the
absorber. The geometry of the magnetic field lines of the rotating dipole is
favourable for the double eclipse events, which we identify with the double
notches observed in pulse profiles of nearby pulsars. For pulsars with large
dipole inclinations 70 <~ alpha <~ 110 deg the double notches are predicted to
occur within a narrow phase range of 20 to 30 deg before the main radio peak.
Application of the model to PSR B0950+08 establishes it as a nearly orthogonal
rotator (alpha =~ 75 deg, beta =~ -10 deg) with many pulse components naturally
interpreted in terms of the inward radio emission from a large range of
altitudes. The inward components include the intermittently strong, leading
component of the main pulse, which would traditionally have been interpeted as
a conal emission in the outward direction. The model also identifies the
magnetic field lines along which the radially extended inward radio emission
occurs in B0950+08. These have a narrow range of the footprint parameter s
close to 1.1 (closed field line region, near the last open field lines). We
describe directional characteristics of inward emission from the radially
extended region and compare them with characteristics of extended outward
emission. Our work shows that pulse profiles of at least some pulsars may be a
superposition of both inward and outward emission.

that rotating prestellar cores collapse to form rings and these rings then
fragment into protostars. We assume that each ring spawns a small number (N <=
6) of protostars, and that the condensation of the protostars is sufficiently
rapid that they can subsequently be treated as point masses. We simulate the
dynamical evolution of a ring of N stars and record the properties of the
single stars, binaries and higher multiples that form as a result of the
dissolution of the ring. The masses of the individual stars in a ring are drawn
from a log-normal distribution with dispersion \sigma. This part of the model
is perfomed for many different realizations of the ring, to obtain good
statistics. The second part of the model is to convolve the results of these
dimensionless simulations, first with the distribution of core masses, which
yields the distributions of multiplicity,mass ratio and eccentricity, as a
function of primary mass; and second with the distribution of core angular
momenta, which yields the distributions of semi-major axis and period, again as
a function of primary mass. Using the observed distribution of core masses, and
the observed distribution of core angular momenta, our model is able to
reproduce the observed IMF, the observed high multiplicity frequency of
pre-Main Sequence stars, the observed distribution of separations, and -- for
long-period systems -- the observed distributions of eccentricity and
mass-ratio, provided we invoke N = 4 or 5 and $\sigma = 0.6$. We presume that
the reduced multiplicity frequency in the field, compared with young clusters,
is the result of dynamical interactions between stars formed in different cores
but the same cluster, following ring dissolution.

this bizarre phenomenon, which requires an information transfer between the two
components, occurs by means of reversal of a direction of coherent radio
emission generated in the same emission region. This interpretation naturally
explains the lack of weak radio emission in the off-pulse regions, as well as
the problem of information transfer between emission regions associated with
the MP precursor and the IP. The reversals also imply nulling. The model has
profound physical implications: (i) the mechanism of coherent radio emission
must allow radiation into two, opposite, intermittently changing directions;
(ii) the radio waves must be able to propagate through inner regions of the
neutron star magnetosphere with strong magnetic field. Most importantly, the
model implies inward radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere.

expansion method is presented. This method, first introduced by Edwards and
Singh to estimate the size of a self-avoiding chain, is restricted to a good
solvent regime, where two-body repulsion leads to chain swelling. We extend the
variational method to a poor solvent regime where the balance between the
two-body attractive and the three-body repulsive interactions leads to
contraction of the chain to form a globule. By employing the Ginzburg
criterion, we recover the correct scaling for the $\theta$-temperature. The
introduction of the three-body interaction term in the variational scheme
recovers the correct scaling for the two important length scales in the globule
- its overall size $R$, and the thermal blob size $\xi_{T}$. Since these two
length scales follow very different statistics - Gaussian on length scales
$\xi_{T}$, and space filling on length scale $R$ - our approach extends the
validity of the uniform expansion method to non-uniform contraction rendering
it applicable to polymeric systems with attractive interactions. We present one
such application by studying the Rayleigh instability of polyelectrolyte
globules in poor solvents. At a critical fraction of charged monomers, $f_c$,
along the chain backbone, we observe a clear indication of a first-order
transition from a globular state at small $f$, to a stretched state at large
$f$; in the intermediate regime the bistable equilibrium between these two
states shows the existence of a pearl-necklace structure.

account both coherent and incoherent effects at scattering. The angular
distribution of radiation was calculated as a sum of radiation from each
electron. It is shown that there are nontrivial angular distributions of the
emitted photons, which is connected to the superposition of the coherent
scattering of electrons by atomic rows (doughnut scattering effect) and the
suppression of the radiation due to the multiple scattering effect (similar to
the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in an amorphous matter). The orientation
dependence of angular distribution of radiation is also analyzed.

contributions and from non-linear effects due to unitarisation or saturation.
It has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of these effects, as
NLO effects are most easily accounted for in momentum space while unitarisation
and saturation are easier in transverse coordinate space. An essential
component of the NLO contributions is due to energy conservation effects, and
in this paper we present a model for implementing such effects together with
saturation in Mueller's dipole evolution formalism. We find that energy
conservation severely dampens the small-x rise of the gluon density and, as a
consequence, the onset of saturation is delayed. Using a simple model for the
proton we obtain a reasonable qualitative description of the x-dependence of F2
at low Q^2 as measured at HERA even without saturation effects. We also give
qualitative descriptions of the energy dependence of the cross section for
gamma*-gamma* and gamma*-nucleus scattering.

degrees of freedom per point, and hence is diffeomorphism invariant, but not
strictly speaking topological. The result is argued to be equivalent to
Hitchin's formulation. The theory is quantized using loop quantum gravity
methods. An orthonormal basis for the diffeomorphism invariant states is given
by diffeomorphism classes of networks of two dimensional surfaces in the six
dimensional manifold. The hamiltonian constraint is polynomial and can be
regulated by methods similar to those used in LQG.
  To connect topological M theory to full M theory, a reduction from 11
dimensional supergravity to Hitchin's 7 dimensional theory is proposed. One
important conclusion is that the complex and symplectic structures represent
non-commuting degrees of freedom. This may have implications for attempts to
construct phenomenologies on Calabi-Yau compactifications.

variational problems. The discretization of the variational problems is done by
representing the solution as a suitable frame decomposition, i.e., a complete,
stable, and redundant expansion. The discretization yields an equivalent
nonlinear problem on $\ell_2(\mathcal{N})$, the space of frame coefficients.
The discrete problem is then adaptively solved using approximated nested fixed
point and Richardson type iterations. We investigate the convergence,
stability, and optimal complexity of the scheme. This constitutes a theoretical
advantage, for example, with respect to adaptive finite element schemes for
which convergence and complexity results are still hard to prove. The use of
frames is further motivated by their redundancy, which, at least numerically,
has been shown to improve the conditioning of the corresponding discretization
matrices. Frames also are usually easier to construct than Riesz bases.
Finally, we show how to apply the adaptive scheme we propose for finding an
approximation to the solution of the PDEs governing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
flows, once suitable frame expansions are constructed.

vertical cylindrical zones with ""bubble-shaped"" cross-sections, in which
acoustic body waves are supposed to reflect. The horizontal size and the shape
of the stress modified areas depend on the values of (K1+K2)/2 - with K1=SH/Sv

horizontal stress and the anisotropy of this stress. The calculation of the
velocities of the P and S double waves allows us to evaluate the radial
thicknesses of these stress modified areas. As their values are different
according to whether they result from P or S waves, we propose an explanation
based on their wavelengths. The comparisons with other works on the in situ

is ""centered"" on a fixed trajectory of a classical particle. This means that a
quantum state becomes specified by more indefinite data. The above spread
resembles, without being an exact analogy, a transfer of energy to smaller and
smaller scales observed in the hydrodynamical turbulence. There, in spite of
the presence of dissipation (in a form of kinematic viscosity), energy is still
conserved. The analogy with the information spread in classical to quantum
transition means that in this process the information is also conserved. To
illustrate that, we show (using as an example a specific case of a coherent
quantum oscillator) how the Shannon information density continuously changes in
the above transition . In a more general scheme of things, such an analogy
allows us to introduce a ""dissipative"" term (connected with the information
