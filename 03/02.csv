virial radius. Extended Press-Schechter theory correctly predicts both this
rapid growth and the substantial overabundance of massive haloes we find at
early times in regions surrounding the dominant object. Although the
large-scale structure in these regions differs dramatically from a scaled
version of its present-day counterpart, the internal structure of the dominant
object is remarkably similar. Molecular hydrogen cooling could start as early
as z~49 in this object, while cooling by atomic hydrogen becomes effective at
z~39. If the first stars formed in haloes with virial temperature ~2000, their
comoving abundance by z=49 would be similar to that of dwarf galaxies today,
while their comoving correlation length would be ~2.5Mpc/h.

"astro-ph/0503014","Jesper Gundermann","Jesper Gundermann","Predicting the CMB power spectrum for binary polyhedral spaces",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  The COBE and the first-year WMAP data both find the CMB quadrupole and
octopole to be anomalously low. Here it is shown, that a finite,
multi-connected universe may explain this anomaly, supporting earlier analyses
[5][18]. A novel technique, pioneered by [16] is used to compute the spectrum
and its variance up to k=102. Based on the properties of the Lie group of
rotations of S^3 it is shown that the spectrum and its variance may be computed
solely from the matrix elements of the group-averaging operator, for each of
the manifolds S^3/I^*, S^3/O^* and S^3/T^*. Further, it is proved that the
spectrum of the CMB may be calculated solely from the radial function, due to
the symmetry properties of the Lie-algebra, which is rigorously proven. It is
shown, that if the topology of the universe is S^3/I^* the uncertainty on the
estimates for the total energy density of the universe may be reduced by an
order of magnitude. Finally, the paper highlights how the unavailability of an
explicit probability function for the observations, given the model, is a
challenge for Monte-Carlo simulations of the binary polyhedral spaces which has
to be addressed in future work.

there seems to be a clear correlation between radio and X-ray activity, we use
an energy budget argument to show that the heating which leads to the X-ray

where there is radio activity without corresponding X-ray activity, we argue
that the radio emission is likely to arise from coherent processes involving
comparatively few particles. In one case, we are able to show from polarization
of the radio emission that this is almost certainly the case. Cases for which
X-ray activity is seen without corresponding radio activity are more difficult
to explain. We suggest that the heating particles may be accelerated to very
high energy, and the resulting synchrotron radio emission may be beamed in
directions other than the line of sight.

particle abundance and lifetime which would deplete Li7 while remaining
consistent with the abundance of Li6. However, in these regions either the D
abundance is unacceptably low or the ratio He3/D is unacceptably large. We
conclude that late particle decay is unable to explain both the discrepancy of

find slight but significant variations in the spectral shape, with values of
$\alpha_x$ ranging from $\sim 1.2-1.6$. We use VLA radio observations, as well
as HST imaging and polarimetry data, to examine the jet's broad-band spectrum
and inquire as to the nature of particle acceleration in the jet. As shown in
previous papers, a simple continuous injection model for synchrotron-emitting
knots, in which both the filling factor, $f_{acc}$, of regions within which
particles are accelerated and the energy spectrum of the injected particles are
constant, cannot account for the X-ray flux or spectrum. Instead, we propose
that $f_{acc}$ is a function of position and energy and find that in the inner
jet, $f_{acc} \propto E_\gamma^{-0.4 \pm 0.2} \propto E_e^{-0.2 \pm 0.1}$, and
in knots A and B, $f_{acc} \propto E_\gamma^{-0.7 \pm 0.2} \propto E_e^{-0.35
\pm 0.1}$, where $E_\gamma$ is the emitted photon energy and and $E_e$ is the
emitting electron energy. In this model, the index $p$ of the injected electron
energy spectrum ($n(E_{e}) \propto E_{e}^{-p}$) is $p=2.2$ at all locations in
the jet, as predicted by models of cosmic ray acceleration by ultrarelativistic
shocks. There is a strong correlation between the peaks of X-ray emission and
minima of optical percentage polarization, i.e., regions where the jet magnetic
field is not ordered. We suggest that the X-ray peaks coincide with shock waves
which accelerate the X-ray emitting electrons and cause changes in the
direction of the magnetic field; the polarization is thus small because of beam
averaging.

$\Phi$ as the perturbation Hamiltonian is believed to be the cause of Neptune
ring arcs' radial offset between theories and observations. To identify the
appropriate perturbation Hamiltonian, the energy integral in the fixed frame of
a restricted three-body system, consisting of the central, primary, and test
bodies, is reconsidered. It is shown that the perturbation energy includes the
disturbing potential $\Phi$ and the potential arising from the angular momentum
terms of the test body. Both potentials happen to be singular as the test body
goes to infinity contradicting to the perturbation nature. These two potentials
can be combined to an energy relevant disturbing potential $\Phi^{*}=\beta\Phi$
which is regular at infinity because of the cancellation of the singularities.
For circular orbits of the primary, the energy equation is conservative, and
$\Phi^{*}$ is identified as the perturbation Hamiltonian. Applying this result
to evaluate the backgrund effect of Triton to the arc-Galatea system of
Neptune, it is shown that there is a small difference
$\Delta\Phi=(\Phi^{*}-\Phi)$ which amounts to an outward radial offset of the
corotation location of Galatea by 0.3 Km. The mismatch between the pattern
speed of Galatea's corotation potential and the mean motion velocity of the
arcs could be resolved by considering the finite mass of Fraternite. However,
by using $\Phi^{*}$, Galatea's eccentricity could be reassessed in terms of the
mass of Fraternite.

systematics. We find that [Mn/H]=-1.44 and [Fe/H]=-1.52 in damped Lya system A,

we favor differential dust-depletion as the main mechanism producing the
observed abundance gradient. The transverse separation is 5 kpc at the redshift
of the absorber, which is also likely to be the lensing galaxy. The derived
abundances therefore probe two opposite sides of a single galaxy hosting both
damped Lya systems. This is the first time firm abundance constraints have been
obtained for a single damped system probed by two lines-of-sight. The
significance of this finding for the cosmic evolution of metals is discussed.

the assumption that radiation pressure on dust grains provides the dominant
vertical support against gravity. This is particularly appropriate when the
disk is optically thick to its own IR radiation, as in the central regions of
ULIRGs. Because the disk radiates at its Eddington limit, the Schmidt-law for
star formation changes in the optically-thick limit, with the star formation
rate per unit area scaling as Sigma_g/kappa, where Sigma_g is the gas surface
density and kappa is the mean opacity. We show that optically thick starburst
disks have a characteristic flux and dust effective temperature of F ~ 10^{13}
L_sun/kpc^2 and T_eff ~ 90K, respectively. We compare our predictions with
observations and find good agreement. We extend our model from many-hundred
parsec scales to sub-parsec scales and address the problem of fueling AGN. We
assume that angular momentum transport proceeds via global torques rather than
a local viscosity. We account for the radial depletion of gas due to star
formation and find a strong bifurcation between two classes of disk models: (1)
solutions with a starburst on large scales that consumes all of the gas with
little fueling of a central AGN and (2) models with an outer large-scale
starburst accompanied by a more compact starburst on 1-10 pc scales and a
bright central AGN. The luminosity of the latter models is in many cases
dominated by the AGN. We show that the vertical thickness of the starburst disk
on pc scales can approach h ~ r, perhaps accounting for the nuclear obscuration
in some Type 2 AGN. We also argue that the disk of young stars in the Galactic
Center may be the remnant of such a compact nuclear starburst.

XB is similar to flare spectra from Class I protostars in luminosity and
temperature, the light curve does not resemble the lightcurves of magnetically

because variations in X-ray count rate were not accompanied by variations in
spectral hardness. The short-term variation of XB may be caused by the partial
blocking of the X-ray plasma, while the month-long flux enhancement may be
driven by mass accretion.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature distribution, considering
Gaussian and non-Gaussian input CMB maps. First, we extract the CMB component
from simulated Planck data (in small patches of the sky) using the maximum
entropy method (MEM), Wiener filter (WF) and a method based on the subtraction
of foreground templates plus a linear combination of frequency channels (LCFC).
We then apply a wavelet-based method to study the Gaussianity of the recovered
CMB and compare it with the same analysis for the input map. When the original
CMB map is Gaussian (and assuming that point sources have been removed), we
find that none of the methods introduce non-Gaussianity (NG) in the CMB
reconstruction. On the contrary, if the input CMB map is non-Gaussian, all the
studied methods produce a reconstructed CMB with lower detections of NG than
the original map. This effect is mainly due to the presence of instrumental
noise. In this case, MEM tends to produce slightly higher non-Gaussian
detections in the reconstructed map than WF whereas the detections are lower
for the LCFC. We have also studied the effect of point sources in the MEM
reconstruction. If no attempt to remove point sources is performed, they
clearly contaminate the CMB reconstruction, introducing spurious NG. When the
brightest point sources are removed from the data using the Mexican Hat
Wavelet, the Gaussian character of the CMB is preserved. However, when
analysing larger regions of the sky, the variance of our estimators will be
appreciably reduced and, in this case, we expect the point source residuals to
introduce spurious NG in the CMB. Thus, a careful subtraction (or masking) of
point source emission is crucial when studying the Gaussianity of the CMB.

be interpreted as a positive feedback. Further, the standard stability

Radio telescope and represent the highest frequency detection done to date in
low emission areas. Because of a weaker Faraday rotation action, the high
frequency allows an estimate of the Galactic synchrotron contamination of the
Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP) that is more reliable than that
done at 1.4 GHz. We find that the angular power spectra of the E- and B-modes

E-mode spectrum is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the CMBP,
allowing a clean detection even at this frequency. The best improvement
concerns the B-mode, for which our single-dish observations provide the first
estimate of the contamination on angular scales close to the CMBP peak (about 2
degrees). We find that the CMBP B-mode should be stronger than synchrotron
contamination at 90 GHz for models with T/S > 0.01. This low level could move

frequency glitches can be attributed to various mechanisms, of which the most
efficient involve differential rotation of the neutron superfluid in the inner
layers of the (magnetically braked) solid crust of a rotating neutron star. In
such a case it is usually supposed that the stress is attributable to pinning
of superfluid vortices to crust nuclei, but it has been suggested that, even if
the pinning effect is too weak, a comparably large stress might still arise
just from the deficit of centrifugal buoyancy in the slowed down crust. The
present work is a re-examination that investigates the way such processes may
be affected by considerations that were overlooked in the previous work --
notably uncertainties about the ``effective'' masses that have to be attributed
to the ``free'' superfluid neutrons to allow for their entrainment by the ionic
crust material. Though restricted to a Newtonian formulation, this analysis
distinguishes more carefully than has been usual between true velocities, which
are contravariantly vectorial, and so called ``superfluid velocities'' that are
proportional to momenta, which are essentially covectorial, a technicality that
is important when more than one independent current is involved. The results
include a Proudman type theorem to the effect that the superfluid angular
velocity must be constant on slightly deformed Taylor cylinders in the force
free case, and it is shown how to construct a pair of integral constants of the
motion that determine the solution for the pinned case assuming beta
equilibrium.

measurements of sigma_* at high redshift are difficult, and the width of the

the utility of using sigma_[OIII] for sigma_* by examining host galaxy
magnitudes and [OIII] line widths for low redshift QSOs. For radio-quiet QSOs,
sigma_[OIII] is consistent in the mean with the value of sigma_* predicted by
the Faber-Jackson relation. For our limited range of host luminosity, scatter
obscures the expected increase of sigma_[OIII] with host luminosity. However,
for a sample of AGN covering a wide range of measured or inferred sigma_*,
there is a clear increase of sigma_[OIII] with sigma_*. Radio-loud QSOs on
average have sigma_* smaller by ~0.1 dex than radio-quiet QSOs of similar host
luminsotiy, at least for luminosities typical of PG QSOs. Star formation rates
in our low redshift QSOs are smaller than required to maintain the typical

two components, one describing the heavy electron Fermi surface, the other, a
sea of oppositely charged, spinless fermions. In the heavy electron state, this
sea of spinless fermions is completely filled and the electron Fermi surface
expands by one electron per unit cell to compensate the positively charged
background, forming a ``large'' Fermi surface. Arbitrarily weak magnetism
causes the spinless Fermi sea to annihilate with part of the Fermi sea of the
conduction electrons, leading to a small Fermi surface. Our results thus enable
us to show that the Fermi surface volume contracts from a large, to a small
volume at a quantum critical point. However, the sum rules also permit the
possible formation of a new phase, sandwiched between the antiferromagnet and
the heavy electron phase, where the charged spinless fermions develop a true
Fermi surface.

by the Se vacancy VSe in p-CuInSe2 and p-CuGaSe2. We find that VSe in the
chalcopyrite materials is amphoteric having two ""negative-U"" like transitions,
i.e. a double-donor transition e(2+/0) close to the valence band and a
double-acceptor transition e(0/2-) closer to the conduction band. We introduce
a classification scheme that distinguishes two types of defects (e.g., donors):
type-alpha, which have a defect-localized-state (DLS) in the gap, and
type-beta, which have a resonant DLS within the host bands (e.g., conduction
band). In the latter case, the introduced carriers (e.g., electrons) relax to
the band edge where they can occupy a perturbed-host-state (PHS). Type alpha is
non-conducting, whereas type beta is conducting. We identify the neutral anion
vacancy as type-alpha and the doubly positively charged vacancy as type-beta.
We suggest that illumination changes the charge state of the anion vacancy and
leads to a crossover between alpha- and beta-type behavior, resulting in
metastability and PPC. In CuInSe2, the metastable behavior of VSe is carried
over to the (VSe-VCu) complex, which we identify as the physical origin of PPC
observed experimentally. We explain previous puzzling experimental results in

and become unstable. At second order transition lines masses of certain
particles vanish. Very close to the first order transition line additional
generations of particles emerge. Strong interactions in some sectors may
generate additional bound states (like breathers) in the asymmetric charge
sector. We briefly describe the properties of various correlation functions in
different phases.

  Effectiveness of Requirements Verification and Validation","6 pages, 3 figures, published: ACM Southeast Conference, March 2005",,,,"cs.SE",,"  This paper presents a unique approach to connecting requirements engineering
(RE) activities into a process framework that can be employed to obtain quality
requirements with reduced expenditures of effort and cost. We propose a
two-phase model that is novel in that it introduces the concept of verification
and validation (V&V) early in the requirements life cycle. In the first phase,
we perform V&V immediately following the elicitation of requirements for each
individually distinct system function. Because the first phase focuses on
capturing smaller sets of related requirements iteratively, each corresponding
V&V activity is better focused for detecting and correcting errors in each
requirement set. In the second phase, a complementary verification activity is
initiated; the corresponding focus is on the quality of linkages between
requirements sets rather than on the requirements within the sets.
Consequently, this approach reduces the effort in verification and enhances the
focus on the verification task. Our approach, unlike other models, has a
minimal time delay between the elicitation of requirements and the execution of
the V&V activities. Because of this short time gap, the stakeholders have a
clearer recollection of the requirements, their context and rationale; this
enhances the stakeholder feedback. Furthermore, our model includes activities
that closely align with the effective RE processes employed in the software
industry. Thus, our approach facilitates a better understanding of the flow of
requirements, and provides guidance for the implementation of the RE process.

framework describing the non-linear coupling between gravitational waves and a
large-scale homogeneous magnetic field is presented. It is shown how this
coupling may be used to amplify seed magnetic fields to strengths needed to
support the galactic dynamo. In situations where the gravitational wave
background is described by an `almost' Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) cosmology we find that the magnitude of the original magnetic field is
amplified by an amount proportional to the magnitude of the gravitational wave
induced shear anisotropy and the square of the field's initial co-moving scale.
We apply this mechanism to the case where the seed field and gravitational wave
background are produced during inflation and find that the magnitude of the
gravitational boost depends significantly on the manner in which the estimate
of the shear anisotropy at the end of inflation is calculated. Assuming a seed
field of $10^{-34}$ $\rm{G}$ spanning a comoving scale of about $10 \rm{kpc}$
today, the shear anisotropy at the end of inflation must be at least as large
as $10^{-40}$ in order to obtain a generated magnetic field of the same order
of magnitude as the original seed. Moreover, contrasting the weak field
approximation to our gauge-invariant approach, we find that while both methods
agree in the limit of high conductivity, their corresponding solutions are
otherwise only compatible in the limit of infinitely long-wavelength
gravitational waves.

inclusive cross sections and the ratio R = sigmaL / sigmaT from Jefferson Lab,
as well as a new model for the transverse asymmetry A2 in the resonance region.
The contributions of both leading and higher twists are extracted, taking into
account effects from radiative corrections beyond the next-to-leading order by
means of soft-gluon resummation techniques. The leading twist is determined
with remarkably good accuracy and is compared with the predictions obtained
using various polarized parton distribution sets available in the literature.
The contribution of higher twists to the g1 moments is found to be
significantly larger than in the case of the unpolarized structure function F2.

suggestions of possible new physics. A robust test of the standard model vs.
new physics is its prediction of equal direct CP violation in $B_s \to K^-

the interference between the dominant penguin amplitude and another amplitude
with a different weak phase and a different strong phase. The penguin
contribution to $B_d \to K^+ \pi^-$ is known to be reduced by a CKM factor in
$B_s \to K^- \pi^+$. Thus the two branching ratios are very different and a
different CP violation is expected. But in the standard model a miracle occurs
and the interfering tree diagram is enhanced by the same CKM factor that
reduces the penguin to give the predicted equality. This miracle is not
expected in new physics; thus a search for and measurement of the predicted CP
violation in $B_s \to K^- \pi^+$ decay is a sensitive test for a new physics
contribution. A detailed analysis shows this prediction to be robust and
insensitive to symmetry breaking effects and possible additional contributions.

would individually be gauge invariant in flat space or at zero interaction
strength, but mix amongst themselves in curved space when interactions are

following Hardy-Sobolev inequality on a smooth domain $\Omega$ of \mathbb{R}^n:

$\partial\Omega$, as we extend here the main result obtained in [15] by proving
that at least in dimension n >= 4, the negativity of the mean curvature of
$\partial \Omega $ at 0 is sufficient to ensure the attainability of
$\mu_{s}(\Omega)$. Key ingredients in our proof are the identification of
symmetries enjoyed by the extremal functions correrresponding to the best
constant in half-space, as well as a fine analysis of the asymptotic behaviour
of appropriate minimizing sequences. The result holds true also in dimension 3

\sigma(J) --> \sigma(K) in A satisfying some axioms, where J,K are subsets of

  The first paper math.AG/0312190 defined configurations and studied moduli
spaces of (I,<)-configurations in A, using the theory of Artin stacks. It
proved well-behaved moduli stacks Obj_A, M(I,<)_A of objects and configurations
in A exist when A is the abelian category coh(P) of coherent sheaves on a
projective K-scheme P, or mod-KQ of representations of a quiver Q.
  Write CF(Obj_A) for the vector space of constructible functions on Obj_A.
Motivated by Ringel-Hall algebras, we define an associative multiplication * on
CF(Obj_A) using pushforwords and pullbacks along 1-morphisms between the
M(I,<)_A, making CF(Obj_A) into an algebra. We also study representations of
CF(Obj_A), the Lie subalgebra CF^ind(Obj_A) of functions supported on
indecomposables, and other algebraic structures on CF(Obj_A).

generalization of constructible functions on stacks introduced in

disrupt traffic flow and, even worse, lead to accidents. In this paper, we
propose a simple model for studying bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic
and aggregate traffic dynamics of a roadway with lane-changing areas. Based on
the observation that, when changing its lane, a vehicle affects traffic on both
its current and target lanes, we propose to capture such lateral interactions
by introducing a new lane-changing intensity variable. With a modified
fundamental diagram, we are able to study the impacts of lane-changing traffic
on overall traffic flow. In addition, the corresponding traffic dynamics can be
described with a simple kinematic wave model. For a location-dependent
lane-changing intensity variable, we discuss kinematic wave solutions of the
Riemann problem of the new model and introduce a supply-demand method for its
numerical solutions. With both theoretical and empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that lane-changes could have significant bottleneck effects on
overall traffic flow. In the future, we will be interested in studying
lane-changing intensities for different road geometries, locations,
on-ramp/off-ramp flows, as well as traffic conditions. The new modeling
framework could be helpful for developing ramp metering and other lane
management strategies to mitigate the bottleneck effects of lane-changes.

have proved their utility in numerous control applications as well as in the
development of general control techniques based on ``adding integrators''.
Nevertheless, the standing assumptions in most of the present literature on
cascaded systems is that, when decoupled, the subsystems constituting the
cascade are uniformly globally asymptotically stable (UGAS). Hence existing
results fail in the more general case when the subsystems are uniformly
semiglobally practically asymptotically stable (USPAS). This situation is often
encountered in control practice, e.g., in control of physical systems with
external perturbations, measurement noise, unmodelled dynamics, etc. This paper
generalizes previous results for cascades by establishing that, under a uniform
boundedness condition, the cascade of two USPAS systems remains USPAS. An
analogous result can be derived for USAS systems in cascade. Furthermore, we
show the utility of our results in the PID control of mechanical systems
considering the dynamics of the DC motors.

  2002","10.1063/1.1480458",,"physics.ins-det",,"  The measurement of the close-to-the-carrier noise of rf and microwave devices
is a relevant issue in time and frequency metrology and in some fields of
electronics, physics and optics. While phase noise is the main concern,
amplitude noise is often of interest. The highest sensitivity is achieved with
the bridge (interferometric) method, which consists of the amplification and
synchronous detection of the noise sidebands after suppressing the carrier by
vector subtraction of an equal signal. A substantial progress in understanding
the flicker noise mechanism of the interferometer results in new schemes that
improve by 20--30 dB the sensitivity at low Fourier frequencies.
  The article provides the complete theory and detailed design criteria, and
reports on the implementation of a prototype. In real-time measurements, a
background noise of -175 -180 dBrad^2/Hz has been obtained at f=1 Hz off the
100 MHz carrier. Exploiting correlation and averaging in similar conditions,
the sensitivity exceeds -185 dBrad^2/Hz at f=1 Hz. A residual noise of -203
dBrad^2/Hz at f=250 Hz off the carrier has been obtained, while the ultimate
noise floor is still limited by the averaging capability of the correlator.
This is equivalent to a S/N ratio of 2E20 with a frequency spacing of 2.5E-6.
  Applications include the measurement of the properties of materials and the
observation of weak flicker-type physical phenomena, out of reach for other
instruments. We measured the flicker noise of a by-step attenuator (-171
dB[rad^2]/Hz at f=1 Hz) and of the ferrite noise of a reactive power divider
(-173.7 dB[rad^2]/Hz at f=1 Hz) without need of correlation.

  Unauthorized Information Gain by Randomizing the Bases Lists with Key Values
  and Invalidate Explicit Privacy Amplification","13 pages, 1 figure, submitted for review to the USENIX 2005",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This paper suggests an improvement to the BB84 scheme in Quantum key
distribution. The original scheme has its weakness in letting quantifiably more
information gain to an eavesdropper during public announcement of unencrypted
bases lists. The security of the secret key comes at the expense of the final
key length. We aim at exploiting the randomness of preparation (measurement)
basis and the bit values encoded (observed), so as to randomize the bases lists
before they are communicated over the public channel. A proof of security is
given for our scheme and proven that our protocol results in lesser information
gain by Eve in comparison with BB84 and its other extensions. Moreover, an
analysis is made on the feasibility of our proposal as such and to support
entanglement based QKD. The performance of our protocol is compared in terms of
the upper and lower bounds on the tolerable bit error rate. We also quantify
the information gain (by Eve) mathematically using the familiar approach of the
concept of Shannon entropy. The paper models the attack by Eve in terms of
interference in a multi-access quantum channel. Besides, this paper also hints
at the invalidation of a separate privacy amplification step in the
""prepare-and-measure"" protocols in general.

consisting of W and EPR states alone cannot be an MREGS. In this context we
prove the surprising result that the relative entropy of entanglement can be
strictly sub-additive for certain pure tri-partite states which is crucial to
keep open the possibility that the set of GHZ-state and EPR states together
constitute an MREGS under ppt-preserving operations.

comparison with other formulations of quantum mechanics and applied to selected
problems in the physical optics of photons and massive particles as well as
flavour oscillations. The classical wave theory of light is derived from these
laws for the case in which temporal variation of path amplitudes may be
neglected, whereas specific experiments, sensitive to the temporal properties
of path amplitudes, are suggested. The reflection coefficient of light from the
surface of a transparent medium is found to be markedly different to that
predicted by the classical Fresnel formula. Except for neutrino oscillations,
good agreement is otherwise found with previous calculations of spatially
dependent quantum interference effects.
