complex morphology and contains a central young starburst with compact young
star clusters. The galaxy was imaged using HST/ACS in the Lyman alpha line and
continuum. Using the Starburst99 synthetic spectra and other imaging data from
HST/WFPC2 we developed a technique that allows us to make the first
photometrically valid continuum subtraction for the LYa line. Our results are
in qualitative agreement with the models of LYa escape being regulated by
kinematical properties of the interstellar medium. The line-only image shows
LYa in both emission and absorption. Notably, emission is seen from central
bright young clusters and is in spatial agreement with the features present in
a longslit spectrum taken with HST/STIS. Diffuse LYa emission regions are seen
surrounding the central starburst where photons escape after one or more
resonant scatterings in HI. These regions dominate the total LYa output.
Photometry reveals a total LYa flux of 194 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2. Inside an
artificial aperture matching that of the IUE satelite, we measure a LYa flux
and equivalent width consistent with previous studies using the IUE. Analysis
of parameter dependencies show our technique to be largely parameter
independent, producing LYa maps indistinguishable from one another by eye and
with fluxes consistent with one another to better than 50%. By comparison of
LYa fluxes with Ha fluxes of a previous study, we estimate that each observed
LYa photon has undergone ~2 additional scatterings. We see that LYa line
closely correlate with other tracers of kinematics.

effectively destroyed by the impact of the jet cocoon, thanks to

also molecular emission, in high redshift radio galaxies which is observed
preferentially in the smaller ones may be explained by that model, which is an
improvement of an earlier radiative bow shock model. The model requires
temperatures of $\approx 10^6$ K in the proto-clusters hosting these objects,
and may be tested by high resolution spectroscopy of the Ly$\alpha$ line. The

suppress the formation of the next generation of stars. We present results from
an Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation demonstrating the formation of
a primordial star within a region ionized by an earlier nearby star. Despite
the higher temperatures of the ionized gas and its flow out of the dark matter
potential wells, this second star formed within 23 million years of its
neighbor's death. The enhanced electron fraction within the HII region
catalyzes rapid molecular hydrogen formation that leads to faster cooling in
the subsequent star forming halos than in the first halos. This ""second

unlike the first protostar, it forms in a rotationally supported disk of
approx. 10-100 solar masses. This is primarily due to the much higher angular
momentum of the halo in which the second star forms. In contrast to previously
published scenarios, such configurations may allow binaries or multiple systems
of lower mass stars to form. These first high resolution calculations offer
insight into the impact of feedback upon subsequent populations of stars and
clearly demonstrate how primordial chemistry promotes the formation of

in energy meets the extrapolated X-ray power-law at an IR break, which was
explicitly observed twice in GX 339-4. This `IR coincidence' has been cited as
further evidence that a jet might make a significant contribution to the X-rays
in hard state systems. We explore this hypothesis with a series of simultaneous
radio/X-ray observations of GX 339-4, taken during its 1997, 1999, and 2002
hard states. We fit these spectra, in detector space, with a simple, but
remarkably successful, doubly broken power-law that requires an IR spectral
break. For these observations, the break position and the integrated radio/IR
flux have stronger dependences upon the X-rays than the simplest jet
predictions. If one allows for a softening of the X-ray power law with
increasing flux, then the jet model agrees with the correlation. We also find
evidence that the radio/X-ray fcorrelation previously observed in GX 339-4
shows a `parallel track' for the 2002 hard state. The slope of the 2002
correlation is consistent with prior observations; however, the radio amplitude
is reduced. We then examine the correlation in Cyg X-1 through the use of radio
data, obtained with the Ryle radio telescope, and RXTE data, from the ASM and

  clusters of ULXs?","Paper presented at the XXII Texas Symposium on Relativistic
  Astrophysics, Stanford University, Dec. 13--17, 2004",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) have been proposed as an
explanation for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Runaway core collapse
inside a massive cluster is a possible mechanism for IMBH formation. But if so,
why are ULXs only rarely found associated with a cluster? We use a simple
analytical approximation to show that rapid core collapse can occur in two
physical regimes. For cluster masses ~ 10^6 M_sun, an IMBH may be formed if the
collapse timescale is <~ 3 Myr, as already well known; the parent cluster is
expected to survive. For cluster masses ~ 10^5 M_sun, an IMBH may result from a
core collapse on even shorter timescales (~ 0.5 Myr), when the protocluster is
still embedded in optically thick gas. Most clusters in this latter regime are
disrupted ``explosively'' as soon as the gas is ionized by the OB stars. We
speculate that this process may produce isolated ULXs with masses up to a few
10^2 M_sun, surrounded by a loose OB association, and perhaps by a nebula,
remnant of the expanding gas from the disrupted protocluster.

explained by this model as caused by the flows induced by the heating through
braiding of magnetic flux. While the model corona is only slowly evolving in

The O abundances in the mean follow the predicted trend from unevolved stars in

one from a compilation based on recent spectroscopic studies of a sample of
massive stars - the ``observational scale'' - and the other from direct
interpolations on a grid of non-LTE spherically extended line-blanketed models
computed with the code CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) - the ``theoretical
scale''. These Teff scales are then further used together with the grid of
models to calibrate other parameters (bolometric correction, luminosity,
radius, spectroscopic mass and ionising fluxes) as a function of spectral type
and luminosity class. Compared to the earlier calibrations of Vacca et al.
(1996) the main results are: 1) the effective temperature scales are cooler by
2000 to 8000 K, the reduction being the largest for early supergiants; 2)
bolometric corrections are lower by 0.1 mag for a given temperature, and are
lower by 0.3 - 0.6 mag for a given spectral type; 3) luminosities are reduced

Gamma Repeaters (SGR's). They are assumed to be associated with star-quakes of
pulsars accelerating electrons and, possibly, protons to high energy in the
huge magnetic fields as inferred from the observations. Because of this and the
observation of non-thermal emission it has been speculated that they may be
cosmic ray accelerators producing gamma-rays up to TeV energies. Neutrino
telescopes, such as AMANDA and the ANTARES now under construction, could be
used as TeV-gamma detectors for very short emissions by measuring underground
muons produced in $\gamma$ showers. We estimate signal and background rates for
TeV photons from SGR giant flares in AMANDA, and we provide an estimate of the
gamma shower events that Milagro could detect.
  Moreover, we consider that, if hadrons are accelerated in these sources, high
energy neutrinos would be produced together with photons. These may be detected
in neutrino telescopes using neutrino-induced cascades and upgoing muons.
  We argue that the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array AMANDA may have
observed the December 27, 2004 giant flare from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR
1806-20 if the non-thermal component of the spectrum extends to TeV energies

describe the global features of a macroscopic system, and those that describe,
or are sensitive to, its local features. In homogeneous systems both variables
generally behave similarly, but this is not at all so in spin glasses. In much
of the literature these two different classes of variables were commingled and
confused. By analyzing their quite different behaviors in finite- and

also reconcile apparent discrepancies between the infinite-volume limit and the
behavior of large, finite volumes, and provide tools for understanding
inhomogeneous systems in a wide array of contexts. We further propose a set of

Unlike most of the perovskite systems, BaZrO3 does not undergo any

paraelectric down to 2 K, even when neglecting zero-point phonon vibrations. On
the other hand, these latter pure quantum effects lead to a negligible thermal
dependency of the cubic lattice parameter below ~ 40 K. They also affect the
dielectricity of BaZrO3 by inducing an overall saturation of the real part of
the dielectric response, for temperatures below ~ 40 K. Two fine structures in
the real part, as well as in the imaginary part, of dielectric response are
further observed around 50-65 K and 15 K, respectively. Microscopic origins
(e.g., unavoidable defects and oxygen octahedra rotation occurring at a local

decoupling (both intergranular and the interlayer) due to the flow of AC
current is one of the main origins of the AC losses in high Tc superconductors.
We have determined the AC losses in superconductors in the rf range by
measuring the absolute value of non-resonant rf power absorbed by the samples.
Our data shows that under certain conditions when both the number density of
JJs present in the sample and the JJ critical current cross a threshold value,
AC losses in the superconducting state keeps on increasing with decreasing
temperature below Tc. The underlying mechanism is an interesting interplay of
JJ coupling energy and the amplitude of rf voltage applied to the sample. The
effect of an applied magnetic field, variation of rf frequency and temperature
were studied in detail. To find out the exact relation between the JJ coupling
energy, JJ number density, applied AC frequency, the amplitude of AC current
and the AC losses in superconductors, we have studied samples of different
crystalline properties, different grain sizes, pressurized with different
pressure and sintered at different physical and chemical situations. The

  conference publication. Extended version with more figures to be added later",,,,"gr-qc",,"  First, for each case to be tested, a specific target inspiral signal is
selected for parameter extraction. In a future real analysis, the target signal
would be a real signal actually observed by a gravitational wave detector such
as LISA. In this study, however, the target signals are themselves simulations.
Some cases were selected to resemble sources likely to be detected by LISA when
it flies; others were selected to facilitate comparison with previous work
using Fisher matrix techniques. Then, for each target inspiral signal, a grid
search of the input parameter space is conducted to determine the set of input
parameters that produce a simulated inspiral output signal compatible with the
target. In this study, we consider four parameters: the two masses, the spin of
the larger black hole, and the eccentricity of the orbit. Searching through
this four dimensional parameter space requires that hundreds of possible input
source parameter combinations be simulated for each target signal analyzed. For
each input parameter combination, the detailed time history of the phase of the
resulting inspiral is simulated and compared with the phase history of the
target signal. The simulation, comparison, and grid search technique used in
this study requires more work than the Fisher matrix technique used in most
previous studies of this topic. However, this method yields a detailed map of
the acceptable region of input parameter space, in contrast to the
multidimensional ellipsoids of the Fisher matrix method. Nevertheless, the
final results are in general agreement with those obtained previously by the
Fisher matrix method, providing a partly independent confirmation of both
results.

However, the violation of weak and dominant energy conditions raises concern,
as in general relativity these conditions ensure causality of the system and
stability of vacuum via Hawking-Ellis conservation theorem. It is shown here
that the non-perturbatively modified kinetic term contributes negative pressure
but positive energy density. This crucial feature leads to violation of energy

limit of some fundamental theories of the microscopic structure of spacetime
and matter, i.e., spacetime described by a differentiable manifold is an
emergent entity and the metric or connection forms are collective variables
valid only at the low energy, long wavelength limit of such micro-theories. In
this view it is more relevant to find ways to deduce the microscopic
ingredients of spacetime and matter from their macroscopic attributes than to
find ways to quantize general relativity because it would only give us the
equivalent of phonon physics, not the equivalents of atoms or quantum
electrodyanmics. It may turn out that spacetime is merely a representation of
collective state of matter in some limiting regime of interactions, which is
the view expressed by Sakharov. In this talk, working within the conceptual
framework of geometro-hydrodynamics, we suggest a new way to look at the nature
of spacetime inspired by Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) physics. We ask the
question whether spacetime could be a condensate, even without the knowledge of
what the `atom of spacetime' is. We begin with a summary of the main themes for
this new interpretation of cosmology and spacetime physics, and the `bottom-up'
approach to quantum gravity. We then describe the `Bosenova' experiment of
controlled collapse of a BEC and our cosmology-inspired interpretation of its
results. We discuss the meaning of a condensate in different context. We
explore how far this idea can sustain, its advantages and pitfalls, and its
implications on the basic tenets of physics and existing programs of quantum
gravity.

The general equations describing the motion of the shell with a general form of

R- and T-regions and shell motion are classified depending on the parameters of
the problem. It is shown that in the case of a positive shell mass there exist
three scenarios for the shell evolution with an infinite motion and two
distinctive types of collapse. Analogous scenarios were classified for the case
of a negative shell mass. In particular this classification shows that it is
impossible for the physical observer to detect the fantom energy flow. We

compact spatial dimension. Such topology allows two twin observers to remain
inertial yet meet periodically. The paradox is resolved by considering the
relationship of each twin to a preferred inertial reference frame which exists
in such a universe because global Lorentz invariance is broken. The twins can
perform ""global"" experiments to determine their velocities with respect to the
preferred reference frame (by sending light signals around the cylinder, for
instance). Here we discuss the possibility of doing so with local experiments.
Since one spatial dimension is compact, the electrostatic field of a point
charge deviates from $1/r^2$. We show that although the functional form of the
force law is the same for all inertial observers, as required by local Lorentz
invariance, the deviation from 1/r2 is observer-dependent. In particular, the
preferred observer measures the largest field strength for fixed distance from
the charge.

production and decay including QCD radiative corrections. We take into account
the full dependence on the top quark spins. We give analytic and numerical
results for single and double differential angular distributions of t tbar
decay products which are due to top quark polarizations and spin correlations

the divergences are removed by means of field redefinitions plus
renormalization constants for the lambda's. I consider non-renormalizable
theories whose renormalizable subsector R is interacting and does not contain
relevant parameters. The ""infinite"" reduction is determined by i) perturbative
meromorphy around the free-field limit of R, or ii) analyticity around the
interacting fixed point of R. In general, prescriptions i) and ii) mutually
exclude each other. When the reduction is formulated using i), the number of
independent couplings remains finite or slowly grows together with the order of
the expansion. The growth is slow in the sense that a reasonably small set of
parameters is sufficient to make predictions up to very high orders. Instead,
in case ii) the number of couplings generically remains finite. The infinite
reduction is a tool to classify the irrelevant interactions and address the
problem of their physical selection.

masses) we solve explicitly the inverse spectral problem of reconstructing the

study of the inverse problem is a peculiar type of simultaneous rational

an additional symmetry condition instead. The results obtained are intriguing

The strength of the \pi_n^0 \gamma \gamma coupling, where n=0 denotes the

instance the ultraviolet power-law behaviour is 1/Q^4 for n \neq 0, and we find
numerically T_{\pi_1}(Q^2) \simeq (4\pi^2/3) (-<\bar q q>/Q^4). This subleading
power-law behaviour is always present. In general its coefficient is not simply
related to f_{\pi_n}. The properties of n \neq 0 pseudoscalar mesons are
sensitive to the pointwise behaviour of the long-range piece of the interaction
between light-quarks.

Libor such that all the Libor interest rates have a common market measure; the
drift is fixed such that each Libor has the martingale property. Libor is
described using a field theory model, and a common measure is seen to be emerge
naturally for such models. To elaborate how the martingale for the Libor
belongs to the general class of numeraire for the forward interest rates, two
other numeraire's are considered, namely the money market measure that makes
the evolution of the zero coupon bonds a martingale, and the forward measure
for which the forward bond price is a martingale. The price of an interest rate
cap is computed for all three numeraires, and is shown to be numeraire
invariant. Put-call parity is discussed in some detail and shown to emerge due
to some non-trivial properties of the numeraires. Some properties of swaps, and
their relation to caps and floors, are briefly discussed.

  EUROCRYPT 2005""",,,"quant-ph cs.CR",,"  It is a standard result in the theory of quantum error-correcting codes that
no code of length n can fix more than n/4 arbitrary errors, regardless of the
dimension of the coding and encoded Hilbert spaces. However, this bound only
applies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect
that correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations
of this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum
error-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors
with fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of
the registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp
distinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes
have the property that any $t$ components reveal no information about the
message, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing
schemes.
  The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and
quantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better
classical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error
correction. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable
quantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is
n/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact
and approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the
delicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.
