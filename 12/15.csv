highest, at z=1.54948, arising in the GRB host galaxy. While the Ly-alpha
feature is outside the range of our spectrum, the high column density of
weakly-depleted Zn suggests that the host is a damped Lyman-alpha system with
N(HI)>10^21(Z/Z_sun)^-1. The bulk of the gas (>80%) is confined to a narrow
velocity range of |v|<30 km/s exhibiting strong dust depletion of refractory
elements such as Fe and Cr. The depletion pattern is similar to that observed
in warm disk clouds of the Milky Way. We also detect absorption from all
ground-level fine-structure states of FeII, the first such example in a QSO-DLA
or GRB-absorption spectrum, which indicate conditions that are consistent with
the ""warm disk"" depletion pattern. The absorption profiles of FeII and MgII
extend over several hundred km/s, with a depletion pattern that more closely
resembles that of QSO-DLAs, suggesting that the sight line to GRB 051111 probes
the halo of the host galaxy in addition to the dense disk. Thus, detailed
diagnostics of the interstellar medium of GRB host galaxies continue to provide
insight into regions which are generally missed in quasar surveys.

disc galaxies in clusters. Studies of galaxies that move face-on have predicted
that in such a geometry the galaxy can lose a substantial amount of its
interstellar medium. But only a small fraction of galaxies is moving face-on.
Therefore, in this work we focus on a systematic study of the effect of the
inclination angle between the direction of motion and the galaxy's rotation
axis.
  In agreement with some previous works, we find that the inclination angle
does not play a major role for the mass loss as long as the galaxy is not
moving close to edge-on. We can predict this behaviour by extending Gunn &
Gott's estimate of the stripping radius, which is valid for face-on geometries,
to moderate inclinations.
  The inclination plays a role as long as the ram pressure is comparable to
pressures in the galactic plane, which can span two orders of magnitude. For
very strong ram pressures, the disc will be stripped completely, and for very
weak ram pressures, mass loss is negligible independent of inclination. We show
that in non-edge-on geometries the stripping proceeds remarkably similar. A
major difference between different inclinations is the degree of asymmetry
introduced in the remaining gas disc.
  We demonstrate that the tail of gas stripped from the galaxy does not
necessarily point in a direction opposite to the galaxy's direction of motion.
Therefore, the observation of a galaxy's gas tail may be misleading about the
galaxy's direction of motion.

find stars above the RGB tip, which we interpret as intermediate-age upper-AGB

these dEs similar to that seen in many, but not all, dEs in the Local Group.
For AM 1339-445, the brightest of the upper-AGB stars have Mbol~-4.5 while

describing the cosmological background evolution of such a system. It is
pointed out that, similar to models with a dark matter/dark energy interaction,
the apparent equation of state measured with SNIa can be smaller than -1. We
then discuss the effect of mass-varying neutrinos on the CMB anisotropies and
the matter power spectrum. A suppression of power in the CMB power spectrum at
large angular scales is usually observed. We give an explanation for this
behaviour and discuss different couplings and quintessence potentials to show
the generality of the results obtained. We perform a likelihood analysis using
wide-ranging SNIa, CMB and LSS observations to assess whether such theories are
viable. Treating the neutrino mass as a free parameter we find that the
constraints on the coupling are weak, since CMB and LSS surveys give only upper
bounds on the neutrino mass. However, fixing a priori the neutrino masses, we
find that there is some evidence that the existence of such a coupling is
actually preferred by current cosmological data over the standard LambdaCDM
cosmology.

If spirals are subdivided by Hubble type, the late-type spirals (Sc and later)
are consistent with axisymmetry, while the earlier spirals are strongly
inconsistent with axisymmetry. The distribution of disk ellipticity can be
fitted adequately with either a Gaussian or a lognormal distribution. The best

hydrodynamic simulations of a LambdaCDM universe to create mock quasar spectra
and CMB sky maps. We find that the high-z Lya forest gas causes temperature
fluctuations of the order of 1 muK rms in the CMB on arcmin scales. The kinetic
and thermal SZ effects have a similar magnitude at z=3, with the thermal effect
becoming relatively weaker as expected at higher z. The CMB signal associated
with lines of sight having HI column densities > 10^18 cm^-2 is only marginally
stronger than that for lower column densities. The strong dependence of rms
temperature fluctuation on mean Lya absorbed flux, however, suggests that the
CMB signal effectively arises in lower density material. We investigate the use
of the cross-correlation of the Lya forest and the microwave background to
detect the SZ effect at redshifts 2-4. In so doing we are able to set direct
limits on the density of diffuse ionised intergalactic baryons. We carry out a
preliminary comparison at a mean redshift z=3 of 3488 quasar spectra from SDSS
Data Release 3 and the WMAP first year data. Assuming that the baryons are
clustered as in a LambdaCDM cosmology, and have the same mean temperature, the
cross-correlation yields a weak limit on the cosmic density of ionised baryons
Omega_(b,I), which is Omega_(b,I) < 0.8 at 95% confidence. With data from
upcoming CMB telescopes, we anticipate that a direct detection of the high
redshift ionised IGM will soon be possible, providing an important consistency
check on cosmological models.

accounts for two types of perturbations: the tidal field corresponding to

dynamical equations are solved linearly, order by order, projecting on a
biorthogonal basis to consistently satisfy the field equation. Since our
solution of the Boltzmann Poisson equations is explicit, it allows statistical
predictions for the ensemble distribution of the inner dynamical features of

derive the kinetic equation which governs the quasi-linear evolution of dark
matter profile induced by infall and its corresponding gravitational
correlations. This yields a Fokker Planck-like equation for the angle-averaged
underlying distribution function. We show how these extensions to the classical
theory could be used to (i) observationally constrain the statistical nature of
the infall (ii) predict the observed distribution and correlations of
substructures in upcoming surveys, (iii) predict the past evolution of the
observed distribution of clumps, and finally (iv) weight the relative
importance of the intrinsic (via the unperturbed distribution function) and

diagrams (CMDs) of its stellar populations. The stellar population with the
blue main sequence (bMS) is observationally suggested to have a helium
abundance much larger, by $\Delta Y\sim 0.12$, than that of the red main
sequence (rMS). By using somewhat idealized models in which stars of the bMS
are formed from gas ejected from those of the rMS, we quantitatively
investigate whether the helium overabundance of the bMS can result from
self-enrichment from massive AGB stars, from mass loss of very massive young
stars, or from type II supernovae within $\omega$ Cen. We show that as long as
the helium enrichment is due to ejecta from the rMS formed earlier than the
bMS, none of the above three enrichment scenarios can explain the observed
properties of the bMS self-consistently for reasonable IMFs. The common,
serious problem in all cases is that the observed number fraction of the bMS
can not be explained without assuming unusually top-heavy IMFs. This failure of
the self-enrichment scenarios implies that most of the helium-enriched gas
necessary for the formation of the bMS originated from other external sources.
We thus suggest a new scenario that most of the second generation of stars
(i.e., the bMS) in $\omega$ Cen could be formed from gas ejected from field
stellar populations that surrounded $\omega$ Cen when it was a nucleus of an
ancient dwarf galaxy.

mechanisms are responsible for triggering star formation in such low-density

outer star-forming regions, we numerically investigate how the impact of dark
matter subhalos orbiting a gas-rich disk galaxy embedded in a massive dark
matter halo influences the dynamical evolution of outer HI gas disk of the
galaxy. We find that if the masses of the subhalos ($M_{\rm sb}$) in a galaxy
with an extended HI gas disk are as large as $10^{-3} \times M_{\rm h}$, where
$M_{\rm h}$ is the total mass of the galaxy's dark halo, local fine structures
can be formed in the extended HI disk. We also find that the gas densities of
some apparently filamentary structures can exceed a threshold gas density for
star formation and thus be likely to be converted into new stars in the outer
part of the HI disk in some models with larger $M_{\rm sb}$. These results thus
imply that the impact of dark matter subhalos (``dark impact'') can be
important for better understanding the origin of recent star formation
discovered in the extreme outer regions of disk galaxies. We also suggest that
characteristic morphologies of local gaseous structures formed by the dark
impact can indirectly prove the existence of dark matter subhalos in galaxies.
We discuss the origin of giant HI holes observed in some gas-rich galaxies

during its 2003 decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion geometry
during state transitions and also the general properties of X-ray emission
during the intermediate and the low-hard states. In this work, we report on the
evolution of spectral and temporal properties in X-rays and the flux in the
radio band with the goal of understanding the nature of state transitions
observed in this source. We concentrate on the transition from the thermal
dominant state to the intermediate state that occurs on a timescale of one day.
We show that the state transition is associated with a sudden increase in
power-law flux. We determine that the ratio of the power-law flux to the
overall flux in the 3--25 keV band must exceed 0.6 to observe strong timing
noise. Even after the state transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, the
system transited back to the thermal dominant state for a day. We show that the
emission from the compact radio core does not turn on during the transition
from the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state but does turn on when
the source reaches the low-hard state, as seen in 4U 1543-47 and GX 339-4. We
find that the photon index correlates strongly with the QPO frequency and
anti-correlates with the rms amplitude of variability. We also show that the
variability is more likely to be associated with the power-law emission than
the disk emission.

selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at 0.04< z < 0.08. At high-z most
systems follow a broad anticorrelation between the fraction of star-forming
galaxies and the system velocity dispersion. At face value, this suggests that
at z=0.4-0.8 the mass of the system largely determines the proportion of
galaxies with ongoing star formation. At these redshifts the strength of star
formation (as measured by the [OII] equivalent width) in star-forming galaxies
is also found to vary systematically with environment. Sloan clusters have much
lower fractions of star-forming galaxies than clusters at z=0.4-0.8 and, in
contrast with the distant clusters, show a plateau for velocity dispersions $
\ge 550 km s^-1$, where the fraction of galaxies with [OII] emission does not
vary systematically with velocity dispersion. We quantify the evolution of the
proportion of star-forming galaxies as a function of the system velocity
dispersion and find it is strongest in intermediate-mass systems (sigma ~
500-600 km s^-1 at z=0). To understand the origin of the observed trends, we
use the Press-Schechter formalism and the Millennium Simulation and show that
galaxy star formation histories may be closely related to the growth history of
clusters and groups. We propose a scheme that is able to account for the
observed relations between the star-forming fraction and \sigma [abridged].

break nor flares between ~1 hr and ~6 d after the burst, and decayed with a
slope 1.70. The afterglow spectrum is well fitted by a power-law model,
suffering absorption both in the Milky Way and in the host galaxy. The
rest-frame Hydrogen column density is significant, N_H_z > 4x10^21 cm^-2, and
the redshift of the absorber is z > 1.5. There was good agreement between the
Swift-XRT and XMM results. By comparing the prompt and afterglow fluxes, we
found that an early break occurred before the XRT observation. The properties
of the GRB 050326 afterglow are well described by a spherical fireball
expanding in a uniform external medium, so a further steepening is expected at
later times. The lack of such a break constrains the jet angle to be >7 deg.
Using the redshift constraints provided by the X-ray analysis, we also
estimated that the beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy was >3x10^51 erg, at the
high end of GRB energies. Despite the brightness in X rays, only deep limits
could be placed by Swift-UVOT at optical/UV wavelengths. Thus, this GRB was

simulations require an artificially large magnetic diffusivity, which smears
out magnetic structures smaller than the grid scale. Assuming a turbulent
cascade for the unresolved artificially smeared magnetic fields, we find that
their unsigned magnetic flux is at least as important as that explicitly shown

contribute to the unsigned flux.Since they are not considered by Khomenko et

hard X-ray sources calls for the identification of their nature by means of
observations at longer wavelengths.
  Aims. In our continuing campaign to identify longer-wavelength counterparts
of these newly-discovered hard X-ray sources detected by INTEGRAL, we observed
the putative optical counterparts of seven southern sources at the South
African Astronomical Observatory and at the European Southern Observatory.
  Methods. Optical spectroscopy was performed on all candidates of these X-ray
sources. For two of these objects, optical photometry was also acquired.
  Results. These observations firmly established the nature of four of these
sources: we found that IGR J10404-4625 (=LEDA 93974), 4U 1344-60 and IGR
J16482-3036 are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts z = 0.0237, 0.013
and 0.0313, respectively, and that 2RXP J130159.6-635806 is a Galactic
High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB). We also give possible optical identifications
for three further objects, namely IGR J11215-5952, IGR J11305-6256 and IGR
J16207-5129, which are consistent with being Galactic HMXBs. Physical
parameters for these objects are also evaluated by collecting and discussing
the available multiwavelength information.
  Conclusions. The detection of four definite or likely HMXBs out of seven
objects in our sample further stresses INTEGRAL's crucial contribution in
hunting this class of object. Also, the determination of the extragalactic
nature of a substantial fraction of the INTEGRAL survey sources underlines the
importance of hard X-ray observations for the study of background AGNs located
beyond the 'Zone of Avoidance' of the Galactic Plane.

uncorrelated noise, presumably of astrophysical origin, in the pulse arrival
time (PAT) residuals for some of them. In most cases, pulsars in globular
clusters show a low-frequency modulation of their rotational phase and spin
rate. The relativistic time delay of the pulsar signal in the curved space time
of randomly distributed and moving globular cluster stars (the Shapiro effect)
is suggested as a possible cause of this modulation.
  Given the smallness of the aberration corrections that arise from the
nonstationarity of the gravitational field of the randomly distributed ensemble
of stars under consideration, a formula is derived for the Shapiro effect for a
pulsar in a globular cluster. The derived formula is used to calculate the
autocorrelation function of the low-frequency pulsar noise, the slope of its
power spectrum, and the behavior of the $\sigma_z$ statistic that characterizes
the spectral properties of this noise in the form of a time function. The
Shapiro effect under discussion is shown to manifest itself for large impact
parameters as a low-frequency noise of the pulsar spin rate with a spectral
index of n=-1.8 that depends weakly on the specific model distribution of stars
in the globular cluster. For small impact parameters, the spectral index of the
noise is n=-1.5.

scale linearly, whilst the errors arising from charge multipole interactions

is demonstrated that a) the leading finite size errors are inverse linear and
inverse cubic in the supercell size, and b) finite size scaling over a series
of supercells gives reliable isolated charged defect formation energies to
around +-0.05 eV. The scaled results are used to test three correction methods.
The Makov-Payne method is insufficient, but combined with the scaling
parameters yields an ab initio dielectric constant of 11.6+-4.1 for InP. Gamma
point corrections for defect level dispersion are completely incorrect, even
for shallow levels, but re-aligning the total potential in real-space between
defect and bulk cells actually corrects the electrostatic defect-defect
interaction errors as well. Isolated defect energies to +-0.1 eV are then
obtained using a 64 atom supercell, though this does not improve for larger
cells. Finally, finite size scaling of known dopant levels shows how to treat
the band gap problem: in less than about 200 atom supercells with no
corrections, continuing to consider levels into the theoretical conduction band
(extended gap) comes closest to experiment. However, for larger cells or when
supercell approximation errors are removed, a scissors scheme stretching the
theoretical band gap onto the experimental one is in fact correct.

that depends on the electron's energy, with the sign being odd with respect to
the distance of that energy from the center of the Landau level. We show how

in the H2 molecule, the most dramatic failure occurs at very large interatomic
distances, where HL predicts a triplet ground state, both in 3D and in 2D,
coming from the absence of electron-electron correlation effects in this
approach. For a 2D double well potential, failures are identified at relatively
smaller interdot distances, and may be attributed to the less confining nature
of the potential, leading to larger overlap and consequently an inadequate
representation of the two-particle states written, within HL, in terms of the
ground state orbital at each isolated well. We find that in the double dot
case, the range of validity of HL is improved (restricted) in a related 3D (1D)

occuring in diamond under high intensity laser excitation and/or VUV
excitation, we studied experimentally the pulsed conductivity induced by
femtosecond VUV pulses, as well as the energy spectra of the photoelectrons
released by the same irradiation. The source of irradiation consists in highly
coherent VUV pulses obtained through high order harmonic generation of a high
intensity femtosecond pulse at a 1.55 eV photon energy (titanium-doped sapphire
laser). Harmonics H9 to H17 have been used for photoconductivity (PC) and
harmonics H13 to H27 for photoemission experiments (PES). As the photon energy
is increased, it is expected that the high energy photoelectrons will generate
secondary e-h pairs, thus increasing the excitation density and consequently
the PC signal. This is not what we observe : the PC signal first increases for
H9 to H13, but then saturates and even decreases. Production of low energy
secondary e-h pairs should also be observed in the PES spectrum. In fact we
observe very few low energy electrons in the PES spectrum obtained with H13 and
H15, despite the sufficient energy of the generated free carriers. At the other
end (H21 and above), a very intense low energy secondary electron peak is
observed. As a help to interprete such data, we realized the first ab initio
calculations of the electronic lifetime of quasiparticles, in the GW
approximation in a number of dielectrics including diamond. We find that the
results are quite close to a simple ""Fermi-liquid"" estimation using the
electronic density of diamond. We propose that a quite efficient mechanism
could be the excitation of plasmons by high energy electrons, followed by the
relaxation of plasmons into individual e-h pairs.

indicators (interspike-interval distributions and their first moments) as well
as of dynamical indicators (autocorrelation functions and conditional

resonances is revealed: one occurs at quite low noise and is related to the
stimulation of subthreshold oscillations around the rest state; the second one

sequence of spikes emitted by the neuron. Bistability in the low noise limit

incoherence is observed at finite noise variance. Finally, the mechanisms

provided by slow rate of simultaneous tunneling of many localized electrons and

giving rise to bond-centered nematic order. This scenario is explored in some
detail for an extended Heisenberg model on a square lattice. In particular, we
present numerical evidence confirming the existence of a state with d-wave
nematic correlations but no long range magnetic order, lying between the
saturated ferromagnetic and collinear antiferromagnetic phases of the

Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technologies still offer an insufficient degree
of multiplexing when required to handle user-selected sets of SNPs. In this
paper we propose a new genotyping assay architecture combining multiplexed
solution-phase single-base extension (SBE) reactions with sequencing by
hybridization (SBH) using universal DNA arrays such as all $k$-mer arrays. In
addition to PCR amplification of genomic DNA, SNP genotyping using SBE/SBH
assays involves the following steps: (1) Synthesizing primers complementing the
genomic sequence immediately preceding SNPs of interest; (2) Hybridizing these
primers with the genomic DNA; (3) Extending each primer by a single base using
polymerase enzyme and dideoxynucleotides labeled with 4 different fluorescent
dyes; and finally (4) Hybridizing extended primers to a universal DNA array and
determining the identity of the bases that extend each primer by hybridization
pattern analysis. Our contributions include a study of multiplexing algorithms
for SBE/SBH genotyping assays and preliminary experimental results showing the
achievable tradeoffs between the number of array probes and primer length on
one hand and the number of SNPs that can be assayed simultaneously on the
other. Simulation results on datasets both randomly generated and extracted
from the NCBI dbSNP database suggest that the SBE/SBH architecture provides a
flexible and cost-effective alternative to genotyping assays currently used in
the industry, enabling genotyping of up to hundreds of thousands of
user-specified SNPs per assay.

object is compared for the cases of a black hole (BH) and a boson star (BS)
playing the role of the central object. It was found in the past that such a
spectrum presents a hardening at high frequencies; however, here it is shown
that the self-interaction and compactness of the BS have the effect of
softening the spectrum, the less compact the star is, the softer the emission
spectrum at high frequencies. Because the mass of the boson fixes the mass of
the star and the self-interaction the compactness of the star, we find that,
for certain values of the BS parameters, it is possible to produce similar
spectra to those generated when the central object is a BH. This result
presents two important implications: (i) using this simple accretion model, a
BS can supplant a BH in the role of compact object accreting matter, and (ii)
within the assumptions of the present accretion disk model we do not find a
prediction that could help distinguish a BH from a BS with appropriate
parameters of mass and self-interaction.

how can we determine the nature of the underlying theory? We initiate an
approach to studying the ""inverse map"" from the space of LHC signatures to the
parameter space of theoretical models within the context of low-energy
supersymmetry, using 1808 LHC observables including essentially all those
suggested in the literature and a 15 dimensional parametrization of the
supersymmetric standard model. We show that the inverse map of a point in
signature space consists of a number of isolated islands in parameter space,
indicating the existence of ""degeneracies""--qualitatively different models with
the same LHC signatures. The degeneracies have simple physical
characterizations, largely reflecting discrete ambiguities in electroweak-ino
spectrum, accompanied by small adjustments for the remaining soft parameters.
The number of degeneracies falls in the range 1<d<100, depending on whether or
not sleptons are copiously produced in cascade decays. This number is large
enough to represent a clear challenge but small enough to encourage looking for
new observables that can further break the degeneracies and determine at the
LHC most of the SUSY physics we care about. Degeneracies occur because
signatures are not independent, and our approach allows testing of any new
signature for its independence. Our methods can also be applied to any other
theory of physics beyond the standard model, allowing one to study how model
footprints differ in signature space and to test ways of distinguishing
qualitatively different possibilities for new physics at the LHC.

model (such as precise choices of flux), one can arrange for the dominant
mediation mechanism transmitting SUSY breaking to the Standard Model to be
either gravity mediation or gauge mediation. Systematic improvement of such
examples may lead to top-down models incorporating a solution to the SUSY

(corresponding to k=3) also break the supersymmetries of M(atrix) theory. The
extra potentials are introduced such that the energy of a static L7-brane
solution becomes finite in the large N limit where N represents the matrix
dimension of fuzzy CP^3. As a consequence, fluctuations from the L7-branes are
suppressed, which effectively describes compactification of M(atrix) theory
down to 7 dimensions. We show that one of the extra potentials can be
considered as a matrix-valued 7-form. The presence of the 7-form in turn
supports a possibility of Freund-Rubin type compactification. This suggests
that our modification of M(atrix) theory can also lead to a physically
interesting matrix model in four dimensions. In hope of such a possibility, we
further consider compactification of M(atrix) theory down to fuzzy S^4 which
can be defined in terms of fuzzy CP^3. Along the way, we also find a new
L5-brane solution to M(atrix) theory which has purely spherical geometry in the

Fermionian multiparticle variables. The nonlinear kinetic equation of Vlasov
and Hartree type are derived for both classical and quantum multiparticle
Hamiltonian systems in the mean field approximation. The possibilities for
finding approximate solutions of these equations from the solutions of
uniformized linear equations are investigated.

tunneling time inside or through such films. Though we can reproduce the

Botswana antiretroviral program began in 2002 and currently treats 34,000
patients with a goal of treating 85,000 patients (~30% of HIV-infected adults)
by 2009. We predict the evolution of drug-resistant strains of HIV that may
emerge as a consequence of this treatment program. We discuss the implications
of our results for the World Health Organization's (WHO's) proposed
surveillance system for detecting drug-resistant strains of HIV in Africa.
Methods: We use a mathematical model of the emergence of drug resistance. We
incorporate demographic and treatment data to make specific predictions as to
when the WHO surveillance threshold is likely to be exceeded. Results: Our
results show - even if rates of acquired resistance are high, but the
drug-resistant strains that evolve are only half as transmissible as wild-type
strains - that transmission of drug-resistant strains will remain low (< 5% by
2009) and are unlikely to exceed the WHO's surveillance threshold. However,our
results show that transmission of drug-resistant strains in Botswana could
increase to ~15% by 2009 if resistant strains are as transmissible as wild-type
strains. Conclusion: The WHO's surveillance system is designed to detect
transmitted resistance that exceeds a threshold level of 5%. Whether this
system will detect drug-resistant strains in Botswana by 2009 will depend upon
the transmissibility of the strains that emerge. Our results imply that it
could be many years before the WHO detects transmitted resistance in other
sub-Saharan African countries with less ambitious treatment programs than
Botswana.

  To be published in the Journal of Complexity",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We study the complexity of approximating the smallest eigenvalue of a
univariate Sturm-Liouville problem on a quantum computer. This general problem
includes the special case of solving a one-dimensional Schroedinger equation
with a given potential for the ground state energy.
  The Sturm-Liouville problem depends on a function q, which, in the case of
the Schroedinger equation, can be identified with the potential function V.
Recently Papageorgiou and Wozniakowski proved that quantum computers achieve an
exponential reduction in the number of queries over the number needed in the
classical worst-case and randomized settings for smooth functions q. Their
method uses the (discretized) unitary propagator and arbitrary powers of it as
a query (""power queries""). They showed that the Sturm-Liouville equation can be
solved with O(log(1/e)) power queries, while the number of queries in the
worst-case and randomized settings on a classical computer is polynomial in
1/e. This proves that a quantum computer with power queries achieves an
exponential reduction in the number of queries compared to a classical
computer.
  In this paper we show that the number of queries in Papageorgiou's and
Wozniakowski's algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In particular we prove a
matching lower bound of log(1/e) power queries, therefore showing that log(1/e)
power queries are sufficient and necessary. Our proof is based on a frequency
analysis technique, which examines the probability distribution of the final

sources can be fully verified without any reference to some other trusted set
of quantum devices. Our main assumption is that the physical system we are
working with consists of several identifiable sub-systems, on which we can
apply some given gates locally.
  To achieve our goal we define the notions of simulation and equivalence. The
concept of simulation refers to producing the correct probabilities when
measuring physical systems. To enable the efficient testing of the composition
of quantum operations, we introduce the notion of equivalence. Unlike
simulation, which refers to measured quantities (i.e., probabilities of
outcomes), equivalence relates mathematical objects like states, subspaces or
gates.
  Using these two concepts, we prove that if a system satisfies some simulation
conditions, then it is equivalent to the one it is purposed to implement. In
addition, with our formalism, we can show that these statements are robust, and
the degree of robustness can be made explicit (unlike the robustness results of
[DMMS00]). In particular, we also prove the robustness of the EPR Test [MY98].
Finally, we design a test for any quantum circuit whose complexity is linear in
the number of gates and qubits, and polynomial in the required precision.

Schr\""{o}dinger problem is further developed. As previously, theoretical
developments are demonstrated on example of diatomic xenon molecule in its
ground electronic state. An exactly solvable reference potential for this
quantum system is used, which enables to solve the related energy eigenvalue
problem exactly. Moreover, the full energy dependence of the phase shift can
also be calculated analytically, and as a particular result, full agreement
with Levinson theorem has been achieved and explicitly demonstrated. In
principle, this important spectral information can be reused to calculate an
improved potential for the system, and such possibilities are discussed in the
paper. Aiming at this goal, one may calculate an auxiliary potential with no
bound states, whose spectral density for positive energies is exactly the same
as that of the reference potential. To this end, one may solve Krein equation,
which in the present context is simpler than using Gelfand-Levitan method.
General solution of Krein equation can be expressed as a Neumann series.
Convergence of this series of multi-dimensional integrals at distances not
close to the origin is hard to achieve without a simple asymptotic formula for
calculating the kernel of Krein equation. As proven in this paper, such an
asymptotic formula exists, and its parameters can be easily ascertained.

Phys. 45(5) (2006) 825-844","10.1088/0253-6102/45/5/013",,"quant-ph",,"  In this article, we propose a general principle of quantum interference for
quantum system, and based on this we propose a new type of computing machine,
the duality computer, that may outperform in principle both classical computer
and the quantum computer.
  According to the general principle of quantum interference, the very essence
of quantum interference is the interference of the sub-waves of the quantum
system itself. A quantum system considered here can be any quantum system: a
single microscopic particle, a composite quantum system such as an atom or a
molecule, or a loose collection of a few quantum objects such as two
independent photons.
  In the duality computer, the wave of the duality computer is split into
several sub-waves and they pass through different routes, where different
computing gate operations are performed. These sub-waves are then re-combined
to interfere to give the computational results. The quantum computer, however,
has only used the particle nature of quantum object. In a duality computer, it
may be possible to find a marked item from an unsorted database using only a
single query, and all NP-complete problems may have polynomial algorithms. Two
proof-of-the-principle designs of the duality computer are presented: the giant
molecule scheme and the nonlinear quantum optics scheme. We also proposed
thought experiment to check the related fundamental issues, the measurement
efficiency of a partial wave function
