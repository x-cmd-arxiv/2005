to traces of hydrogen at early phases.
  The generated spectra are found to match the observed ones reasonably well,
including a list of only 23 candidate ions. Guided by SN Ib 1990I, the observed
trough near 6300\AA is attributed to H$\alpha$ in almost all Type Ib events,
although in some objects it becomes too weak to be discernible, especially at
later phases. Alternative line identifications are discussed. Differences in
the way hydrogen manifests its presence within CCSNe are highlighted. In Type
Ib SNe, the H$\alpha$ contrast velocity (i.e. line velocity minus the
photospheric velocity) seems to increase with time at early epochs, reaching
values as high as 8000 km s$^{-1}$ around 15-20 days after maximum and then
remains almost constant. The derived photospheric velocities, indicate a lower
velocity for Type II SNe 1987A and 1999em as compared to SN Ic 1994I and SN IIb
1993J, while Type Ib events display a somewhat larger variation. The scatter,
around day 20, is measured to be $\sim$5000 km s$^{-1}$. Following two simple
approaches, rough estimates of ejecta and hydrogen masses are given. A mass of
hydrogen of approximately 0.02 $M_\odot$ is obtained for SN 1990I, while SNe
1983N and 2000H ejected $\sim$0.008 $M_\odot$ and $\sim$0.08 $M_\odot$ of
hydrogen, respectively. SN 1993J has a higher hydrogen mass, $\sim 0.7$
$M_\odot$ with a large uncertainty. A low mass and thin hydrogen layer with
very high ejection velocities above the helium shell, is thus the most likely
scenario for Type Ib SNe. Some interesting and curious issues relating to
oxygen lines suggest future investigations.

temperatures T_B>10^{12}K and high degrees of circular polarisation (1%).
Standard synchrotron models that assume a power-law electron distribution
cannot produce such high temperatures and have much lower degrees of intrinsic
circular polarisation. We examine the synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation
from a monoenergetic electron distribution using standard synchrotron theory.
Constraints on the source parameters are found by formulating the results as
functions of the source size, Doppler boosting factor, optical depth to
synchrotron self-absorption, maximum frequency of synchrotron emission, and the
strength of the inverse Compton radiation. The model gives brightness
temperatures T_B=10^{13}K to 10^{14}K for moderate (<10) Doppler boosting
factors and intrinsic degrees of circular polarisation at the percent level. It
predicts a spectrum I_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3} between the radio and the infra-red
as well as emission in the MeV to GeV range. We find the conditions under which
electrons do not cool within the source, enabling the GHz emission to emerge
without absorption and the potentially catastrophic energy losses by inverse
Compton scattering to be avoided. We suggest that sources such as PKS 1519
-273, PKS 0405 -385 and J 1819 +3845 can be understood within this scenario
without invoking high Doppler boosting factors, coherent emission mechanisms,
or the dominance of proton synchrotron radiation.

model independent approach to determine a number of important physical
parameters of the dark energy as functions of redshift directly from the data.
Here, we expand this method to include the determinations of its potential and
kinetic energy as functions of redshift. We show that the dark energy potential
and kinetic energy may be written as combinations of the first and second
derivatives of the coordinate distance with respect to redshift. We expand the
data set to include new supernova measurements, and now use a total of 248
coordinate distances that span the redshift range from zero to 1.79. First and
second derivatives of the coordinate distance are obtained as functions of
redshift, and these are combined to determine the potential and kinetic energy
of the dark energy as functions of redshift. An update on the redshift behavior
of the dimensionless expansion rate E(z), the acceleration rate q(z), and the

of material moving at relativistic velocities. Emission from such a jet should
be visible even when viewed from outside the angle of collimation. I summarize
recent work on the special relativistic transformation of the burst quantities
Eiso and Epeak as a function of viewing angle, where Eiso is the
isotropic-equivalent energy of the burst and Epeak is the peak of the burst
spectrum in the power nu F_nu. The formulae resulting from this work serve as
input for a Monte Carlo population synthesis method, with which I investigate
the importance of off-jet relativistic kinematics as an explanation for a class
of GRBs termed ""X-ray Flashes"" (XRFs). I do this in the context of several
top-hat shaped variable opening-angle jet models. I find that such models
predict a large population of off-jet bursts that are observable and that lie
away from the Epeak ~ Eiso^(1/2) relation. The predicted burst populations are
not seen in current datasets. I investigate the effect of the bulk gamma value
upon the properties of this population of off-jet bursts, as well as the effect
of including an Omega0-Egamma correlation to jointly fit the Epeak ~ Eiso^(1/2)
and Epeak ~ Egamma^(beta) relations, where Omega0 is the opening solid angle of
the GRB jet. I find that the XRFs seen by HETE-2 and BeppoSAX cannot be easily
explained as classical GRBs viewed off-jet. I also find that an inverse
correlation between gamma and Omega0 has the effect of greatly reducing the
visibility of off-jet events. Therefore, unless gamma > 300 for all bursts or
unless there is a strong inverse correlation between gamma and Omega0, top-hat
variable opening-angle jet models produce a significant population of bursts
away from the Epeak ~ Eiso^(1/2) and Epeak ~ Egamma^(beta) relations.

They should thus be regarded as indicative, but still qualitative. We find
that, compared to a case with no Urca-active nuclei, the case with Urca effects
leads to a higher entropy in the convective core because the energy released by
nuclear burning is confined to a smaller volume by the effective boundary at
the Urca shell. All else being equal, this will tend to accelerate the
progression to dynamical runaway. We discuss the open issues regarding the

  Reviews in Modern Astronomy, 19, 1",,"10.1002/9783527619030.ch1",,"astro-ph",,"  A brief history of the determination of the Hubble constant H_0 is given.
Early attempts following Lemaitre (1927) gave much too high values due to
errors of the magnitude scale, Malmquist bias and calibration problems. By 1962
most authors agreed that 75< H_0 <130. After 1975 a dichotomy arose with values
near 100 and others around 55. The former came from apparent-magnitude-limited
samples and were affected by Malmquist bias. New distance indicators were
introduced; they were sometimes claimed to yield high values of H_0, but the
most recent data lead to H_0 in the 60's, yet with remaining difficulties as to
the zero-point of the respective distance indicators. SNe Ia with their large
range and very small luminosity dispersion (avoiding Malmquist bias) offer a
unique opportunity to determine the large-scale value of H_0. Their maximum
luminosity can be well calibrated from 10 SNe Ia in local parent galaxies whose
Cepheids have been observed with HST. An unforeseen difficulty - affecting all
Cepheid distances - is that their P-L relation varies from galaxy to galaxy,
presumably in function of metallicity. A proposed solution is summarized here.
The conclusion is that H_0 = 63.2 +/- 1.3 (random) +/- 5.3 (systematic) on all
scales. The expansion age becomes then (with Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7)

multimodality of the distribution and favor one in which the absolute
one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially distributed and with a
three-dimensional mean velocity of 380^{+40}_{-60} km s^-1. We then proceed
with a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modelling the birth properties
of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and
Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We present a population model that appears
generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest that pulsars
are born in the spiral arms, with a Galactocentric radial distribution that is
well described by the functional form proposed by Yusifov & Kucuk (2004), in
which the pulsar surface density peaks at radius ~3 kpc. The birth spin period
distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of
multimodality. Models which assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to be
independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are inadequate, as they
lead to the detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations.
Dithered radio luminosities proportional to the square root of the spin-down
luminosity accommodate the observations well and provide a natural mechanism
for the pulsars to dim uniformly as they approach the death line, avoiding an
observed pile-up on the latter. There is no evidence for significant torque
decay (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the
pulsars as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate
and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.

  CH3CN emission is detected in 58 sources (70 %) of our sample). We estimate
the temperature and column density for 37 of these using the rotational diagram
method. The temperatures we derive range from 28-166 K, and are lower than
previously reported temperatures, derived from higher J transitions. We find
that CH3CN is brighter and more commonly detected towards ultra-compact HII
(UCHII) regions than towards isolated maser sources. Detection of CH3CN towards
isolated maser sources strongly suggests that these objects are internally
heated and that CH3CN is excited prior to the UCHII phase of massive
star-formation.
  HCO+ is detected towards 82 sources (99 % of our sample), many of which
exhibit asymmetric line profiles compared to H13CO+. Skewed profiles are
indicative of inward or outward motions, however, we find approximately equal
numbers of red and blue-skewed profiles among all classes. Column densities are
derived from an analysis of the HCO+ and H13CO+ line profiles.
  80 sources have mid-infrared counterparts: 68 seen in emission and 12 seen in
absorption as `dark clouds'. Seven of the twelve dark clouds exhibit asymmetric
HCO+ profiles, six of which are skewed to the blue, indicating infalling
motions. CH3CN is also common in dark clouds, where it has a 90 % detection

based on an inclined ring of hot gas that orbits the black hole along geodesic
trajectories. For spinning black holes, this ring will precess around the spin
axis of the black hole at the Lense-Thirring (``frame-dragging'') frequency.
Using a relativistic ray-tracing code, we calculate X-ray light curves and
observed energy spectra as a function of the radius and tilt angle of the ring,
the spin magnitude, and the inclination of the black hole. The model predicts
higher-amplitude QPOs for systems with high inclinations, as seen in a growing

estimate the image background. The second is an advanced photometry technique,
which measures the flux, position (to sub-pixel accuracy), local background and
point spread function. We apply the source detection filter to simulated
Herschel-SPIRE data and show the filter's ability to both detect point sources
and also simultaneously estimate the image background. We use the photometry
method to analyse a simple simulated image containing a source of unknown flux,
position and point spread function; we not only accurately measure these
parameters, but also determine their uncertainties (using Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo sampling). The method also characterises the nature of the source
(distinguishing between a point source and extended source). We demonstrate the
effect of including additional prior knowledge. Prior knowledge of the point
spread function increase the precision of the flux measurement, while prior
knowledge of the background has onlya small impact. In the presence of higher
noise levels, we show that prior positional knowledge (such as might arise from
a strong detection in another waveband) allows us to accurately measure the
source flux even when the source is too faint to be detected directly. These
methods are incorporated in SUSSEXtractor, the source extraction pipeline for
the forthcoming Akari FIS far-infrared all-sky survey. They are also

We also find that quantum fluctuations in the spin-orbital sector drive the

inevitable.

effects of disorder produced by such a percolating lattice are insufficient to
explain this transition: a quantum site percolation model predicts y_c ~ 0.8,

increasing Hubbard energy, we find that an Altshuler-Aronov suppression of the
density of states, delta N(E) ~ sqrt(| E-E_F |), reduces the density of states
at the Fermi energy to zero at the critical Hubbard interaction. Using this
ratio of correlation to hopping energy one is led to a prediction for the value

the case where the expected GW is a quasi-periodic frequency modulated signal
i.e., a chirp. In this article, we address the question of detecting an a
priori unknown GW chirp. We introduce a general chirp model and claim that it
includes all physically realistic GW chirps. We produce a finite grid of
template waveforms which samples the resulting set of possible chirps. If we
follow the classical approach (used for the detection of inspiralling binary
chirps, for instance), we would build a bank of quadrature matched filters
comparing the data to each of the templates of this grid. The detection would
then be achieved by thresholding the output, the maximum giving the individual
which best fits the data. In the present case, this exhaustive search is not
tractable because of the very large number of templates in the grid. We show
that the exhaustive search can be reformulated (using approximations) as a
pattern search in the time-frequency plane. This motivates an approximate but
feasible alternative solution which is clearly linked to the optimal one.

and nuclear targets. We hope that there will be future modeling applications in
high-energy particle astrophysics. We modify the dipole model of McDermott,
Frankfurt, Guzey, and Strikman (MFGS) by fixing the cross section at the
maximum value allowed by the unitarity constraint whenever the dipole model
would otherwise predict a unitarity violation. We observe that, under
reasonable assumptions, a significant fraction of the real photon cross section
results from dipole interactions where the QCD coupling constant is small, and
that the MFGS model is consistent with the Froissart bound. The resulting model
predicts a rise of the cross section of about a factor of 12 when the the
photon energy is increased from $10^{3}$ GeV to $10^{12}$ GeV. We extend the
analysis to the case of scattering off a $^{12}$C target. We find that, due to
the low thickness of the light nuclei, unitarity for the scattering off
individual nucleons plays a larger role than for the scattering off the nucleus
as a whole. At the same time the proximity to the black disk limit results in a
substantial increase of the amount of nuclear shadowing. This, in turn, slows
down the rate of increase of the total cross section with energy as compared to
the proton case. As a result we find that the $^{12}$C nuclear cross section
rises by about a factor of 7 when the photon energy is increased from $10^{3}$
GeV to $10^{12}$ GeV. We also find that the fraction of the cross section due
to production of charm reaches 30% for the highest considered energies with a

this article, we revisit Draco as a source of dark matter annihilation
radiation, with these new observational constraints in mind. We discuss the
prospects for the experiments MAGIC and GLAST to detect dark matter in Draco,
as well as constraints from the observations of EGRET. We also discuss the
possibility that the CACTUS experiment has already detected gamma-rays from
Draco. We find that it is difficult to generate the flux reported by CACTUS
without resorting to non-thermally produced WIMPs and/or a density spike in
Draco's dark matter distribution due to the presence of an intermediate mass
black hole. We also find that for most annihilation modes, a positive detection
of Draco by CACTUS would be inconsistent with the lack of events seen by EGRET.

This construction is based on the reduction of the underlying Neumann type
boundary value problem for the propagator of the theory to that of the much
more manageable Dirichlet problem. In its turn, this reduction follows from the
recently suggested Neumann-Dirichlet duality which we extend beyond the tree
level approximation. In the one-loop approximation this duality suggests that
the functional determinant of the differential operator subject to Neumann
boundary conditions in the bulk factorizes into the product of its Dirichlet
counterpart and the functional determinant of a special operator on the brane
-- the inverse of the brane-to-brane propagator. As a byproduct of this
relation we suggest a new method for surface terms of the heat kernel
expansion. This method allows one to circumvent well-known difficulties in heat
kernel theory on manifolds with boundaries for a wide class of generalized
Neumann boundary conditions. In particular, we easily recover several lowest
order surface terms in the case of Robin and oblique boundary conditions. We
briefly discuss multi-loop applications of the suggested Dirichlet reduction

This is done from both the Cheeger-Simons and the deRham-Federer viewpoints.
The central result of the paper is the formulation and proof of a
Lefschetz-Pontrjagin Duality Theorem, which asserts that the pairing:
Ch^k(X,dX) x Ch^{n-k-1}(X) --> S^1, given by (a,b) l-->(a*b)[X], induces
isomorphisms:
  D : Ch^k(X,dX) --> Hom^{smooth}(Ch^{n-k-1}(X), S^1)
  D': Ch^{n-k-1}(X) --> Hom^{smooth}(Ch^k(X, dX), S^1) onto the smooth
Pontrjagin duals. In particular, D and D' are injective with dense range in the
group of all continuous homomorphisms into the circle. A coboundary map is
introduced which yields a long sequence for the character groups associated to
the pair (X,dX). The relation of the sequence to the duality mappings is
analyzed.

possess a finite number of stationary measures. We discuss dependence of
stationary measures on an auxiliary parameter, thus describing bifurcations of
families of random diffeomorphisms. A bifurcation theory is developed under
mild regularity assumptions on the diffeomorphisms and the noise distribution
(e.g. smooth diffeomorphisms with uniformly distributed additive noise are
included). We distinguish bifurcations where the density function of a
stationary measure varies discontinuously or where the support of a stationary
measure varies discontinuously.
  We establish that generic random diffeomorphisms are stable. Densities of
stable stationary measures are shown to be smooth and to depend smoothly on an
auxiliary parameter, except at bifurcation values. The bifurcation theory
explains the occurrence of transients and intermittency as the main bifurcation
phenomena in random diffeomorphisms. Quantitative descriptions by means of
average escape times from sets as functions of the parameter are provided.
Further quantitative properties are described through the speed of decay of
correlations as function of the parameter.
  Random endomorphisms are studied in one dimension; we show that stable one
dimensional random endomorphisms occur open and dense and that in one parameter
families bifurcations are typically isolated. We classify codimension one
bifurcations for one dimensional random endomorphisms; we distinguish three
possible kinds, the random saddle node, the random homoclinic and the random
boundary bifurcation. The theory is illustrated on families of random circle
diffeomorphisms and random unimodal maps.

distributions of charged particles in an electromagnetic field. After
discussing the limitations inherent in the Lorentz-Dirac equation for a single
point particle a simple model is proposed for a charged continuum interacting
self-consistently with the Maxwell field in vacuo. The model is developed using
intrinsic tensor field theory and exploits to the full the symmetry and
light-cone structure of Minkowski spacetime. This permits the construction of a
regular stress-energy tensor whose vanishing divergence determines a system of
non-linear partial differential equations for the velocity and self-fields of
accelerated charge. Within this covariant framework a particular perturbation
scheme is motivated by an exact class of solutions to this system describing
the evolution of a charged fluid under the combined effects of both self and
external electromagnetic fields. The scheme yields an asymptotic approximation
in terms of inhomogeneous linear equations for the self-consistent Maxwell
field, charge current and time-like velocity field of the charged fluid and is
defined as an ultra-relativistic configuration. To facilitate comparisons with
existing accounts of beam dynamics an appendix translates the tensor
formulation of the perturbation scheme into the language involving electric and
magnetic fields observed in a laboratory (inertial) frame.

undergo Jahn-Teller shape deformations. Such a deformation represents a
collective and coherent vibrational excitation and enables electronic
transitions to occur without a multiphonon bottleneck. We analyze this
mechanism for a metal cluster within the analytical framework of a
three-dimensional potential well undergoing a spheroidal distortion. An
expression for the time evolution of the distortion parameter is derived, the
electronic level crossing condition formulated, and the probability of

predator-prey competition and coexistence with Lotka-Volterra type interactions
defined on a $d$-dimensional lattice. Introducing spatial degrees of freedom
and allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical,
deterministic mean-field picture. Already within mean-field theory, however,
spatial constraints, modeling locally limited resources, lead to the emergence
of a continuous active-to-absorbing state phase transition. Field-theoretic
arguments, supported by Monte Carlo simulation results, indicate that this
transition, which represents an extinction threshold for the predator
population, is governed by the directed percolation universality class. In the
active state, where predators and prey coexist, the classical center
singularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or
foci. In the vicinity of the stable nodes, the system is characterized by
essentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey. Near
the stable foci, however, the stochastic lattice Lotka-Volterra system displays
complex, correlated spatio-temporal patterns of competing activity fronts.
Correspondingly, the population densities in our numerical simulations turn out
to oscillate irregularly in time, with amplitudes that tend to zero in the
thermodynamic limit. Yet in finite systems these oscillatory fluctuations are
quite persistent, and their features are determined by the intrinsic
interaction rates rather than the initial conditions. We emphasize the
robustness of this scenario with respect to various model perturbations.

another. On the other hand, nonlocal time constraints, induced by a $1/f$ noise

Schroedinger. This led to numerous quantum paradoxes which are reconsidered in
this paper. The development of quantum measurement theory, initiated by von
Neumann, indicated a possibility for resolution of this interpretational crisis
by divorcing the algebra of the dynamical generators from the algebra of the
actual observables. It is shown that within this approach quantum causality can
be rehabilitated in the form of a superselection rule for compatibility of past
observables with the potential future. This rule, together with the
self-compatibility of measurements insuring the consistency of histories, is
called the nondemolition principle. The application of this causality condition
in the form of the dynamical commutation relations leads to the derivation of
the generalized von Neumann reductions, usharp, instantaneous, spontaneous, and
even continuous in time. This gives a quantum probabilistic solution, in the
form of the dynamical filtering equations, of the notorious measurement problem
which was tackled unsuccessfully by many famous physicists starting with
Schroedinger and Bohr. The simplest Markovian quantum stochastic model for the
continuous in time measurements involves a boundary-value problem in second
quantization for input ""offer"" waves in one extra dimension, and a reduction of
the algebra of ""actual"" observables to an Abelian subalgebra for the output
waves.

  version in spanish. (Full abstract is in the thesis file)",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.other",,"  Recently developed quantum algorithms suggest that quantum computers can
solve certain problems and perform certain tasks more efficiently than
conventional computers. Among other reasons, this is due to the possibility of
creating non-classical correlations, or quantum entanglement, which is a
phenomena hard or impossible to reproduce by classical-information methods.
  In this thesis I first investigate the simulation of quantum systems on a
quantum computer constructed of two-level quantum elements or qubits. For this
purpose, I present algebra mappings that allow one to obtain physical
properties and compute correlation functions of fermionic, anyonic, and bosonic
systems with such a computer. The results obtained show that the complexity of
preparing a quantum state which contains the desired information for the
computation is crucial.
  Second, I present a wide class of quantum computations, which could involve
entangled states, that can be simulated with the same efficiency on both types
of computers. The notion of generalized quantum entanglement then naturally
emerges. This generalization of entanglement is based on the idea that
entanglement is an observer-dependent concept, that is, relative to a set of
preferred observables.

a decoherence mechanism, only one observable is required in order to achieve
the same goal. In this way the decoherence can assist the process. We show
that, depending on the sort of decoherence, the process can converge faster or
slower than the method implemented by means of two complementary observables.

of this process can be decomposed into characteristic modes undergoing
independent squeezing evolution akin to the Schmidt decomposition of the
biphoton spectrum. The main features of this decomposition can be understood
using a simple analytical model developed in the perturbative regime. In the
strong pumping regime, for which the perturbative approach is not valid, we
present a numerical analysis, specializing to the case of one-dimensional
propagation in a beta-barium borate waveguide. Characterization of the
squeezing modes provides us with an insight necessary for optimizing homodyne
detection of squeezing. For a weak parametric process, efficient squeezing is
found in a broad range of local oscillator modes, whereas the intense
generation regime places much more stringent conditions on the local
oscillator. We point out that without meeting these conditions, the detected
squeezing can actually diminish with the increasing pumping strength, and we
expose physical reasons behind this inefficiency.
