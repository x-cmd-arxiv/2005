  Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the spectral and temporal radiative signatures expected within the
""Supercritical Pile"" model of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB). This model is motivated
by the need for a process that provides the dissipation necessary in GRB and
presents a well defined scheme for converting the energy stored in the
relativistic protons of the Relativistic Blast Waves (RBW) associated with GRB
into radiation; at the same time it leads to spectra which exhibit a peak in
the burst $\nu F_{\nu}$ distribution at an energy $E_p \simeq 1$ MeV in the
observer's frame, in agreement with observation and largely independent of the
Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the associated relativistic outflow. Futhermore,
this scheme does not require (but does not preclude) acceleration of particles
at the shock other than that provided by the isotropization of the flow bulk
kinetic energy on the RBW frame. In the present paper we model in detail the
evolution of protons, electrons and photons from a RBW to produce detailed
spectra of the prompt GRB phase as a function of time from across a very broad
range spanning roughly $4 log_{10} \Gamma$ decades in frequency. The model
spectra are in general agreement with observations and provide a means for the
delineating of the model parameters through direct comparison with trends
observed in GRB properties.

In such a case, the usual interpretation of the CMB dipole as being due to the
relative motion of the observer with respect to the CMB rest frame is not
appropriate. Instead, we find that the measured dipole is due to the observer
motion relative to the cosmic center of mass rest frame. This means, in
particular, that even an observer at rest with respect to the CMB radiation
could measure a non-vanishing dipole anisotropy, provided dark energy is moving
with respect to the CMB. We also consider the consequences of moving dark
energy for the determination of cosmic bulk flows.

low-state counterpart to the Ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) population, searching
for a soft-hard state dichotomy similar to that known for Galactic X-ray
binaries and testing the specific predictions of the IMBH hypothesis. To this
end, we searched for ""low-state"" objects, which we defined as objects within
our sample which had a spectrum well fit by a simple absorbed power law, and
""high-state"" objects, which we defined as objects better fit by a combined
blackbody and a power law. Assuming that ``low-state'' objects accrete at
approximately 10% of the Eddington luminosity (Done & Gierlinski 2003) and that
""high-state"" objects accrete near the Eddington luminosity we further divided
our sample of sources into low and high state ULX sources. We classify 16
sources as low-state ULXs and 26 objects as high-state ULXs. As in Galactic
black hole systems, the spectral indices, Gamma, of the low-state objects, as
well as the luminosities, tend to be lower than those of the high-state
objects. The observed range of blackbody temperatures for the high state is
0.1-1 keV, with the most luminous systems tending toward the lowest
temperatures. We therefore divide our high-state ULXs into candidate IMBHs
(with blackbody temperatures of approximately 0.1 keV) and candidate stellar
mass BHs (with blackbody temperatures of approximately 1.0 keV). A subset of
the candidate stellar mass BHs have spectra that are well-fit by a

observations. The detection of OI, OII, OIII, OVII, OVIII, and NeIX Kalpha
absorption lines allows us to measure the atomic column densities of the
neutral, warm ionized, and hot phases of the ISM through much of the Galactic
disk. By comparing these measurements with the 21 cm hydrogen emission and with
the pulsar dispersion measure along the same sight line, we estimate the mean
oxygen abundances in the neutral and total ionized phases as 0.3(0.2, 0.6) and
2.2(1.1, 3.5) in units of Anders & Grevesse (1989) solar value. This
significant oxygen abundance difference is apparently a result of molecule/dust
grain destruction and recent metal enrichment in the warm ionized and hot
phases. We also measure the column density of neon from its absorption edge and
obtain the Ne/O ratio of the neutral plus warm ionized gas as 2.1(1.3, 3.5)
solar. Accounting for the expected oxygen contained in molecules and dust
grains would reduce the Ne/O ratio by a factor of ~1.5. From a joint-analysis
of the OVII, OVIII, and NeIX lines, we obtain the Ne/O abundance ratio of the
hot phase as 1.4(0.9, 2.1) solar, which is not sensitive to the exact
temperature distribution assumed in the absorption line modeling. These
comparable ISM Ne/O ratios for the hot and cooler gas are thus considerably

coronal temperature structure of 31 Com is significantly hotter showing a clear

show evidence for a FIP effect in which coronae are depleted in high FIP
elements relative to their photospheres by a factor of $\sim 2$. In contrast,
31 Com is characterized by a lack of FIP effect. In other words, neither
depletion nor enhancement relative to stellar photospheric values is found. We
conclude that the structural changes during the evolution of late-type giants
could be responsible for the observed differences in coronal abundances and
temperature structure. In particular, the size of the convection zone coupled
with the rotation rate seem obvious choices for playing a key role in
determining coronal characteristics.

those extra terms, without the need for dark matter. As specific example, we
model X-ray profiles of clusters of galaxies and the galaxy rotation curves

magnetic reconnection taking place at a relatively low altitude during the

still sufficient to produce the heating in the lower atmosphere where the

clusters, despite their faintness, are likely a critical galaxy type for
understanding the processes behind galaxy formation. Dwarf ellipticals are the
most common galaxy type, and are particularly abundant in rich galaxy clusters.
The dwarf to giant ratio is in fact highest in rich clusters of galaxies,
suggesting that cluster dEs do not form in groups that later merge to form
clusters. Dwarf ellipticals are potentially the only galaxy type whose
formation is sensitive to global, rather than local, environment. The dominant
idea for explaining the formation of these systems, through Cold Dark Matter
models, is that dEs form early and within their present environments. Recent
results suggest that some dwarfs appear in clusters after the bulk of massive
galaxies form, a scenario not predicted in standard hierarchical structure
formation models. Many dEs have younger and more metal rich stellar populations
than dwarfs in lower density environments, suggesting processes induced by rich
clusters play an important role in dE formation. Several general galaxy cluster
observations, including steep luminosity functions, and the origin of
intracluster light, are natural outcomes of this delayed formation.

cores, the simplest star-forming sites, has significantly improved since the
last IAU Symposium on Astrochemistry (South Korea, 1999). Research done over
these years has revealed that major molecular species like CO and CS
systematically deplete onto dust grains at the interior of pre-stellar cores,
while species like N2H+ and NH3 survive in the gas phase and can usually be
detected towards the core centers. Such a selective behaviour of molecular
species gives rise to a differentiated (onion-like) chemical composition, and
manifests itself in molecular maps as a dichotomy between centrally peaked and
ring-shaped distributions. From the point of view of star-formation studies,
the identification of molecular inhomogeneities in cores helps to resolve past
discrepancies between observations made using different tracers, and brings the
possibility of self-consistent modelling of the core internal structure. Here I
present recent work on determining the physical and chemical structure of two
pre-stellar cores, L1498 and L1517B, using observations in a large number of
molecules and Monte Carlo radiative transfer analysis. These two cores are
typical examples of the pre-stellar core population, and their chemical
composition is characterized by the presence of large freeze out holes in most
molecular species. In contrast with these chemically processed objects, a new
population of chemically young cores has started to emerge. The characteristics
of its most extreme representative, L1521E, are briefly reviewed.

Zn, Y, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu have been obtained. The abundances for thick disk
stars are compared with those for thin disk members from Reddy et al. (2003).
The ratios of $\alpha$-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti) to iron for thick disk
disk stars show a clear enhancement compared to thin disk members in the range
$-0.3 <$ [Fe/H] $ < -1.2$. There are also other elements -- Al, Sc, V, Co, and
possibly Zn -- which show enhanced ratios to iron in the thick disk relative to
the thin disk. The abundances of Na, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Cu (relative to Fe) are
very similar for thin and thick disk stars. The dispersion in abundance ratios
[X/Fe] at given [Fe/H] for thick disk stars is consistent with the expected
scatter due to measurement errors, suggesting a lack of `cosmic' scatter. The
observed compositions of the thin and thick disks seem to be consistent with
models of galaxy formation by hierarchical clustering in a $\Lambda$CDM
universe. In particular, the distinct abundance patterns observed in the thin
and thick disks, and the chemical homogeneity of the thick disk at different
galactocentric distances favor a scenario in which the majority of thick-disk
stars were formed {\it in situ}, from gas rich merging blocks.

transport. Here we use this model to study the effect of spin-flip scattering
on electrical conduction through a quantum dot with chaotic dynamics. The spin
decay rate gamma is quantified by the correlation of spin-up and spin-down
current fluctuations (spin-flip noise). The resulting decoherence reduces the
ability of the quantum dot to produce spin-entangled electron-hole pairs. For
gamma greater than a critical value gamma_c, the entanglement production rate
vanishes identically. The statistical distribution P(gamma_c) of the critical
decay rate in an ensemble of chaotic quantum dots is calculated using the
methods of random-matrix theory. For small gamma_c this distribution is
proportional to gamma_c^(-1+beta/2), depending on the presence (beta=1) or
absence (beta=2) of time-reversal symmetry. To make contact with experimental
observables, we derive a one-to-one relationship between the entanglement
production rate and the spin-resolved shot noise, under the assumption that the
density matrix is isotropic in the spin degrees of freedom. Unlike the Bell
inequality, this relationship holds for both pure and mixed states. In the
tunneling regime, the electron-hole pairs are entangled if and only if the
correlator of parallel spin currents is at least twice larger than the
correlator of antiparallel spin currents.

simulation of large deformations of metals at high strain-rates and high
temperatures. Several such models exist and it is difficult to determine the
applicability of any single model to the particular problem at hand. Ideally,
the models are based on the underlying (subgrid) physics and therefore do not
need to be recalibrated for every regime of application. In this work we
compare the Johnson-Cook, Steinberg-Cochran-Guinan-Lund, Zerilli-Armstrong,
Mechanical Threshold Stress, and Preston-Tonks-Wallace plasticity models. We
use OFHC copper as the comparison material because it is well characterized.
First, we determine parameters for the specific heat model, the equation of
state, shear modulus models, and melt temperature models. These models are
evaluated and their range of applicability is identified. We then compare the
flow stresses predicted by the five flow stress models with experimental data
for annealed OFHC copper and quantify modeling errors. Next, Taylor impact
tests are simulated, comparison metrics are identified, and the flow stress
models are evaluated on the basis of these metrics. The material point method
is used for these computations. We observe that the all the models are quite
accurate at low temperatures and any of these models could be used in
simulations. However, at high temperatures and under high-strain-rate
conditions, their accuracy can vary significantly.

the thermal and magnetic properties of integrable spin ladder models and their
applicability to the physics of real compounds. The ground state properties of
the integrable two-leg spin-1/2 and the mixed spin-(1/2,1) ladder models at
zero temperature are analyzed by means of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.
Solving the TBA equations yields exact results for the critical fields and
critical behaviour. The thermal and magnetic properties of the models are
investigated in terms of the recently introduced High Temperature Expansion
method, which is discussed in detail. It is shown that in the strong coupling
limit the integrable spin-1/2 ladder model exhibits three quantum phases: (i) a
gapped phase in the regime $H<H_{c1}$, (ii) a fully polarised phase for
$H>H_{c2}$, and (iii) a Luttinger liquid magnetic phase in the regime
$H_{c1}<H<H_{c2}$. The critical behaviour in the vicinity of the critical
points is of the Pokrovsky-Talapov type. The temperature-dependent thermal and
magnetic properties are directly evaluated from the exact free energy
expression and compared to known experimental results for a range of strong
coupling ladder compounds. Similar analysis of the mixed spin-(1/2,1) ladder
model reveals a rich phase diagram, with a 1/3 and a full saturation
magnetisation plateau within the strong antiferromagnetic rung coupling regime.
For weak rung coupling, the fractional magnetisation plateau is diminished and
a new quantum phase transition occurs. The phase diagram can be directly
deduced from the magnetisation curve obtained from the exact result derived
from the HTE. The thermodynamics of the spin-orbital model with different
single-ion anisotropies is also investigated.

the eigenvalues of the collision matrix. A heuristic second-order algorithm in

phase composition, magnetic and charge order. It is shown that three different
types of MR effects occur. In cubic SrFeO3 (x = 0) a large negative MR of 25%
at 9 T is associated with a hitherto unknown 60 K magnetic transition and a
subsequent drop in resistivity. The 60 K transition appears in addition to the
onset of helical ordering at ~130 K. In crystals with vacancy-ordered
tetragonal SrFeO(3-x) as majority phase (x ~0.15) a coincident
charge/antiferromagnetic ordering transition near 70 K gives rise to a negative
giant MR effect of 90% at 9 T. A positive MR effect is observed in tetragonal
and orthorhombic materials with increased oxygen deficiency (x = 0.19, 0.23)
which are insulating at low temperatures. Phase mixtures can result in a
complex superposition of these different MR phenomena. The MR effects in
SrFeO(3-x) differ from those in manganites as no ferromagnetic states are
involved.

finite-length analysis of message-passing iterative decoding of low-density
parity-check codes. To this end we introduce the concept of graph-cover
decoding. Whereas in maximum-likelihood decoding all codewords in a code are
competing to be the best explanation of the received vector, under graph-cover
decoding all codewords in all finite covers of a Tanner graph representation of
the code are competing to be the best explanation. We are interested in
graph-cover decoding because it is a theoretical tool that can be used to show
connections between linear programming decoding and message-passing iterative
decoding. Namely, on the one hand it turns out that graph-cover decoding is
essentially equivalent to linear programming decoding. On the other hand,
because iterative, locally operating decoding algorithms like message-passing
iterative decoding cannot distinguish the underlying Tanner graph from any
covering graph, graph-cover decoding can serve as a model to explain the
behavior of message-passing iterative decoding. Understanding the behavior of
graph-cover decoding is tantamount to understanding the so-called fundamental
polytope. Therefore, we give some characterizations of this polytope and
explain its relation to earlier concepts that were introduced to understand the
behavior of message-passing iterative decoding for finite-length codes.

is a parameter of the model that also determines the late-time Hubble constant:
H_0 \sim \mu. In these models, besides the massless spin two graviton, there is
a scalar excitation of the spacetime metric whose mass depends on the
background curvature. This dependence is such that this scalar, although almost
massless in vacuum, becomes massive and effectively decouples when one gets
close to any source and we recover an acceptable weak field limit at short
distances. There is also a (classical) ``running'' of Newton's constant with
the distance to the sources and gravity is easily enhanced at large distances
by a large ratio. We comment on the possibility of building a model with a
MOND-like Newtonian limit that could explain the rotation curves of galaxies
without introducing Dark Matter using this kind of actions. We also explore
briefly the characteristic gravitational phenomenology that these models imply:
besides a long distance modification of gravity they also predict deviations
from Newton's law at short distances. This short distance scale depends on the
local background curvature of spacetime, and we find that for experiments on
the Earth surface it is of order \sim 0.1mm, while this distance would be
bigger in space where the local curvature is significantly lower.

the low lying eigenmodes and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator undergo a
transition to localization similar to the one observed in a disordered
conductor. This suggests that Anderson localization is the fundamental
mechanism driving the chiral phase transition. We also find an additional
temperature dependent mobility edge (separating delocalized from localized
eigenstates) in the bulk of the spectrum which moves toward lower eigenvalues
as the temperature is increased. In both regions, the origin and the bulk, the
transition to localization exhibits features of a 3D Anderson transition
including multifractal eigenstates and spectral properties that are well
described by critical statistics. Similar results are obtained in both the

gravitino problem has a natural built in solution within supersymmetry.
Supersymmetry allows a large number of flat directions made up of {\it gauge
invariant} combinations of squarks and sleptons. Out of many at least {\it one}
generically obtains a large vacuum expectation value during inflation. Gauge
bosons and Gauginos then obtain large masses by virtue of the Higgs mechanism.
This makes the rate of thermalization after the end of inflation very small and
as a result the Universe enters a {\it quasi-thermal phase} after the inflaton
has completely decayed. A full thermal equilibrium is generically established
much later on when the flat direction expectation value has substantially
decareased. This results in low reheat temperatures, i.e., $T_{\rm R}\sim {\cal
O}({\rm TeV})$, which are compatible with the stringent bounds arising from the
big bang nucleosynthesis. There are two very important implications: the
production of gravitinos and generation of a baryonic asymmetry via
leptogenesis during the quasi-thermal phase. In both the cases the abundances
depend not only on an effective temperature of the quasi-thermal phase (which
could be higher, i.e., $T\gg T_{\rm R}$), but also on the state of equilibrium
in the reheat plasma. We show that there is no ``thermal gravitino problem'' at
all within supersymmetry and we stress on a need of a new paradigm based on a
``quasi-thermal leptogenesis'', because in the bulk of the parameter space the
{\it old} thermal leptogenesis cannot account for the observed baryon
asymmetry.

unusual (wrong) splitting between the a_0(980) and \kappa(900) and the a_0(980)
width can be understood from QSSR within a \bar qq assignement. However, none
of the \bar qq and \bar q\bar q qq results can explain the large \kappa width,
which may suggest that it can result from a strong interference with
non-resonant backgrounds. In the I=0 channel, QSSR and some low-energy theorems
(LET) require the existence of a low mass gluonium \sigma_B(1 GeV) coupled
strongly to Goldstone boson pairs which plays in the U(1)_V channel, a similar
role than the \eta' for the value of the U(1)_A topological charge. The
observed \sigma(600) and f_0(980) mesons result from a maximal mixing between
the gluonium \sigma_B and \bar qq(1 GeV) mesons, a mixing scheme which passes
several experimental tests. OZI violating J/\psi--> \phi\pi^+\pi^-, D_s--> 3\pi
decays and J/\psi--> \gamma S glueball filter processes may indicate that most
of the I=0 mesons above 1 GeV have important gluonium in their wave functions.
We expect that the f_0(1500), f_0(1710) and f_0(1790) have significant gluonium

it has evolved to cover an ever wider range of examples. The most critical
extension was to replace Fredholm operators in the classical sense by
Breuer-Fredholm operators in a semifinite von Neumann algebra. The first part
of this paper gives a brief account of this theory extending and refining
earlier results. It is then applied in the latter parts of the paper to a
series of examples. One of the most powerful tools is an integral formula for
spectral flow. This integral formula was known for Dirac operators in a variety
of forms ever since the fundamental papers of Atiyah, Patodi and Singer. One of
the purposes of this exposition is to make contact with this early work so that
one can understand the recent developments in a proper historical context. In
addition we show how to derive these spectral flow formulae in the setting of
Dirac operators on (non-compact) covering spaces of a compact spin manifold
using the adiabatic method.

of a vector mKdV equation coming from a parallel frame, a vector potential mKdV
equation coming from a covariantly-constant frame, and higher order
counterparts generated by an underlying vector mKdV recursion operator. In the
Lie-group case the hierarchy comprises a group-invariant analog of the vector

models necessary for modeling astrophysical environments such as neutron stars
and core-collapse supernovae. In anticipation of (t,3He) experiments at 115

it is shown via a study of the 26Mg(t,3He) reaction that this probe is an
accurate tool for extracting Gamow-Teller transition strengths. To do so, the
data are complemented by results from the 26Mg(3He,t) reaction at 140
MeV/nucleon which allows for a comparison of T=2 analog states excited via the
mirror reactions. Extracted Gamow-Teller strengths from 26Mg(t,3He) and
26Mg(3He,t) are compared with those from 26Mg(d,2He) and 26Mg(p,n) studies,
respectively. A good correspondence is found, indicating probe-independence of
the strength extraction. Furthermore, we test shell-model calculations using
the new USD-05B interaction in the sd-model space and show that it reproduces
the experimental Gamow-Teller strength distributions well. A second goal of
this work is to improve the understanding of the (t,3He) and (3He,t) reaction

Distorted-Wave Born Approximation is employed, taking into account the

cipher is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, if
the eavesdropper is using resistors and noise voltage generators just like the
sender and the receiver. The eavesdropper can extract zero bit of information
before she is discovered. However, when the eavesdropper is using noise current
generators, though the cipher is protected, the eavesdropper may still be able
to extract one bit of information while she is discovered. For enhanced
security, we expand the KLJN cipher with the comparison of the instantaneous
voltages via the public channel. In this way, the sender and receiver has a
full control over the security of measurable physical quantities in the
Kirchhoff-loop. We show that when the sender and receiver compare not only
their instantaneous current data but also their instantaneous voltage data then
the zero-bit security holds even for the noise current generator case. We show
that the original KLJN scheme is also zero-bit protected against that type of
MITM attack when the eavesdropper uses voltage noise generators, only. In
conclusion, within the idealized model scheme, the man-in-the-middle-attack
does not provide any advantage compared to the regular attack considered
earlier. The remaining possibility is the attack by a short, large current
pulse, which described in the original paper as the only efficient type of
regular attacks, and that yields the one bit security. In conclusion, the KLJN
cipher is superior to known quantum communication schemes in every respect,
including speed, robustness, maintenance need, price and its natural immunity
against the man-in-the-middle attack.

continuum, the orthogonal rotation is defined. It forms two sets of equations:
one set is geometrical equations, another set is the motion equations. The
Lorentz transformation can be directly derived from the geometrical equations,
and the proper time of general relativity is well expressed by time
displacement field. By the motion equations, the typical time displacement
field of matter motion is discussed. The research shows that the quantum field
theory can be established based on the concept of orthogonal rotation. On this
sense, the quantum matter motion in physics is viewed as the orthogonal
rotation of spacetime continuum. In this paper, it shows that there are three
typical quantum solutions. One is particle-like solution, one is
generation-type solution, and one is pure wave type solution. For each typical
solution, the force fields are different. Many features of quantum field can be
well explained by this theoretic form. Finally, the general matter motion is
discussed, the main conclusions are: (1). Geometrically, cosmic vacuum field
can be described by the curvature spacetime; (2). The spatial deformation of
planet is related with a planet electromagnetic field; (3). For electric charge
less matter, the volume of matter will be expanding infinitely; (4).For strong
electric charge matter, it shows that the volume of matter will be contracting
infinitely.

strongly temperature- and depth- dependent viscosity in a three-dimensional
spherical shell is carried out to study the mantle convection of single-plate
terrestrial planets like Venus or Mars without an Earth-like plate tectonics.
The strongly temperature-dependent viscosity (the viscosity contrast across the
shell is $\geq 10^5$) make the convection under stagnant-lid short-wavelength
structures. Numerous, cylindrical upwelling plumes are developed because of the
secondary downwelling plumes arising from the bottom of lid. This convection
pattern is inconsistent with that inferred from the geodesic observation of the
Venus or Mars. Additional effect of the stratified viscosity at the upper/lower
mantle (the viscosity contrast is varied from 30 to 300) are investigated. It
is found that the combination of the strongly temperature- and depth-dependent
viscosity causes long-wavelength structures of convection in which the
spherical harmonic degree $\ell$ is dominant at 1--4. The geoid anomaly
calculated by the simulated convections shows a long-wavelength structure,
which is compared with observations. The degree-one ($\ell = 1$) convection
like the Martian mantle is realized in the wide range of viscosity contrast
from 30 to 100 when the viscosity is continuously increased with depth at the

two-mode squeezed state. For this we extend the Bloch-Messiah reduction
theorem, previously known for discrete linear systems (S. L. Braunstein, Phys.

of dispersion, one mode pair dominates the process, leading to a simple
interpretation of entanglement in this continuous-variable system. However,
many mode pairs are excited in the presence of dispersion-induced temporal
walkoff of the Stokes, as witnessed by the photon-count statistics. We also
consider the readout of the stored atomic polarization using the anti-Stokes
scattering process. We prove that the readout process can also be decomposed

designed to find the minimum of a classical cost function whose domain has size
N. We show that poor choices for the Hamiltonian can guarantee that the
algorithm will not find the minimum if the run time grows more slowly than
square root of N. These poor choices are nonlocal and wash out any structure in
the cost function to be minimized and the best that can be hoped for is Grover
speedup. These failures tell us what not to do when designing quantum adiabatic
algorithms.

considered in the measurement of the position of a particle when the
interaction lasts for a finite amount of time. When the measurement has finite
duration, both the motion of the pointer and the particle influence the result
of the measurement. Provided that the particle is in an eigenstate of its
position at the start of the measurement, the pointer will indicate the
arithmetic average between the initial and final position of the particle.
Furthermore, the probability that the pointer will indicate a given average
value is equal to the transition probability for the undisturbed particle to
experience the change in position. If the initial state of the pointer is a
narrow wavepacket, then for any initial state of the particle, the measurement
yields, approximately, the undisturbed probability distribution for the
position of the particle at the end of the measurement.

data and theory was done using the concept of the root-mean-square deviation, a
procedure that has been criticized in literature. Here we propose a special
statistical analysis which should be performed separately for the experimental
data and for the results of the theoretical computations. In so doing, the
random, systematic, and total experimental errors are found as functions of
separation, taking into account the distribution laws for each error at 95%
confidence. Independently, all theoretical errors are combined to obtain the
total theoretical error at the same confidence. Finally, the confidence
interval for the differences between theoretical and experimental values is
obtained as a function of separation. This rigorous approach is applied to two
recent experiments on the Casimir effect.

  quantum fields","6 pages, 2 graphes. Changes added",,,,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  Using path integrals we express the quantum nonlocality of AB-effect type in
the form of singularity. The gauge-fixing term in path integrals induce the AB
effect in ordinary scattering processes. This means that all scattering
processes are accompanied by nonlocal effect. The formulae are then extended to
theory of fields that additionally include a scalar potential. It turns out
that the degree of freedom of nonlocality in quantum fields is just the degree
of the ghosts. Furthermore, renormalization method can be related to this type
of nonlocal effect.

in a cooled fiber. Noise photons induced by spontaneous Raman scattering were
suppressed by cooling a dispersion shifted fiber with liquid nitrogen, which
resulted in a significant improvement in the visibility of two-photon
interference. By using this scheme, time-bin entangled qubits were successfully
distributed over 60 km of optical fiber with a visibility of 76%, which was
obtained without removing accidental coincidences.

achieved by the two-color stationary light phenomenon is near unity. We
theoretically discuss the two-color stationary light for the frequency

directions. The resulting process may apply the coherent interactions of a weak
field to nonlinear quantum optics such as quantum nondemolition measurement.

classical average (given by an infinite-dimensional Gaussian integral) and
quantum average (given by the von Neumann trace formula). We can interpret this
mathematical construction as a procedure of ``dequantization'' of quantum
mechanics. We represent quantum mechanics as an asymptotic projection of
classical statistical mechanics with infinite-dimensional phase-space. This
space can be represented as the space of classical fields, so quantum mechanics
is represented as a projection of ``Prequantum Classical Statistical Field
Theory''.

dynamics of open systems. An apparent violation of complete positivity can
occur because there are prior correlations of the principal system with the
environment, or if the applied transformation is correlated with the state of
the system. We provide a physically motivated definition of accessible non-CP
maps and derive two necessary conditions for a map to be accessible. We also
show that entanglement between the system and the environment is not necessary
to generate a non-CP dynamics. We describe two simple approximations that may
be sufficient for some problems in process tomography, and then outline what
these methods may be able to tell us in other situations where non-CP dynamics
naturally arise.
