formation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number,
using high-resolution numerical simulations of a LCDM cosmology. We confirm
results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and that
this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that
halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the
dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately
parameterized in a simple way: b(c,M|z) = b(M|z) b(c|M/M*). The scaling between
bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high concentration
(early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M <~ M* while low
concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass
halos, M >~ M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo
clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) and
discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra
and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on
clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are
significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results
suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs)
should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clustered
counterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in
voids. They also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster samples
with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias
cosmological parameter estimation.

  presented more detailed explanation of a key formula used in the paper","Astrophys.J.647:55-59,2006","10.1086/505297",,"astro-ph",,"  The decay rate of cosmological gravitational potential measures the deviation
from Einstein-de Sitter universe and can put strong constraints on the nature
of dark energy and gravity. Usual method to measure this decay rate is through
the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect-large scale structure (LSS) cross
correlation. However, the interpretation of the measured correlation signal is
complicated by the galaxy bias and matter power spectrum. This could bias
and/or degrade its constraints to the nature of dark energy and gravity. But,
combining the lensing-LSS cross correlation measurements, the decay rate of
gravitational potential can be isolated. For any given narrow redshift bin of
LSS, the ratio of the two cross correlations directly measures $[d\ln
D_{\phi}/d\ln a]H(z)/W(\chi,\chi_s)$, where $D_{\phi}$ is the linear growth
factor of the gravitational potential, $H$ is the Hubble constant at redshift
$z$, $W(\chi,\chi_s)$ is the lensing kernel and $\chi$ and $\chi_s$ are the
comoving angular diameter distance to lens and source, respectively. This
method is optimal in the sense that (1) the measured quantity is essentially
free of systematic errors and is only limited by cosmic variance and (2) the
measured quantity only depends on several cosmological parameters and can be
predicted from first principles unambiguously. Though fundamentally limited by
inevitably large cosmic variance associated with the ISW measurements, it can
still put useful independent constraints on the amount of dark energy and its
equation of state. It can also provide a powerful test of modified gravity and
can distinguish the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model from $\Lambda$CDM at
$>2.5\sigma$ confidence level.

colors using spectra from SDSS DR4. Emission lines are detected in more than
half of the red galaxies. We focus on the relationship between two emission
lines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: Ha 6563 and [OII] 3727.
There is a strong bimodality in [OII]/Ha ratio in the full SDSS sample which
closely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. Nearly all of the
line-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of AGN --
most commonly LINERs, a small fraction of transition objects and, more rarely,
Seyferts. Only ~6% of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. A straight
line in the [OII]-Ha equivalent width plane separates LINER-like galaxies from
other categories. Quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines and
LINER-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence in
color-magnitude-concentration space. [OII] EWs in LINER- and AGN-like galaxies
can be as large as in star-forming galaxies. Thus, unless objects with
AGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded, [OII] emission cannot be used directly
as a proxy for star formation rate. Lack of [OII] emission is generally used to
indicate lack of star formation when post-starburst galaxies are selected at
high redshift. Our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut on
AGN properties as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriously
incomplete sets of post-starburst galaxies. Furthermore, post-starburst
galaxies identifed in SDSS by requiring minimal Ha EW generally exhibit weak
but nonzero line emission with ratios typical of AGNs; few of them show
residual star formation. This suggests that most post-starbursts may harbor
AGNs/LINERs.

the self-gravity of the flow needs to be considered. Because Poisson's equation
is linear, the numerical solution for the gravitational potential for each
individual mode of the density can be pre-computed, thus reducing substantially
the computational cost of the method. In this second paper, we describe two
different approaches to computing the gravitational field of a two-dimensional
flow with pseudo-spectral methods. For situations in which the density profile
is independent of the third coordinate (i.e., an infinite cylinder), we use a
standard Poisson solver in spectral space. On the other hand, for situations in
which the density profile is a delta function along the third coordinate (i.e.,
an infinitesimally thin disk), or any other function known a priori, we perform
a direct integration of Poisson's equation using a Green's functions approach.
We devise a number of test problems to verify the implementations of these two
methods. Finally, we use our method to study the stability of polytropic,
self-gravitating disks. We find that, when the polytropic index Gamma is <=
4/3, Toomre's criterion correctly describes the stability of the disk. However,
when Gamma > 4/3 and for large values of the polytropic constant K, the
numerical solutions are always stable, even when the linear criterion predicts
the contrary. We show that, in the latter case, the minimum wavelength of the
unstable modes is larger than the extent of the unstable region and hence the
local linear analysis is inapplicable.

its surrounding medium fueled to the seed hole is greatly heated by Compton
heating. For a super-critical accretion onto a $10^3\sunm$ seed hole, a Compton
sphere (with a temperature $\sim 10^6$K) forms in a timescale of $1.6\times

of the strong outflow heats the medium at large distance, this leads to a
dramatical decrease of the outer Bondi accretion onto the black hole and avoid
the accumulation of the matter. The highly super-critical accretion will be
rapidly halted by the strong feedback. The seed black holes hardly grow up at

constraints for two nonlocal, covariant quark models within the mean field
approximation. In the first case (Model I) the nonlocality arises from the
regularization procedure, motivated by the instanton liquid model, whereas in
the second one (Model II) a separable approximation of the one-gluon exchange
interaction is applied. We find that Model II predicts a larger quark mass gap
and a chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) phase transition line which extends 15-20%
further into the phase diagram spanned by temperature (T) and chemical
potential (mu). The corresponding critical temperature at mu=0, T_c(0)~140 MeV,
is in better accordance to recent lattice QCD results than the prediction of
the standard local NJL model, which exceeds 200 MeV. For both Model I and Model
II we have considered various coupling strengths in the scalar diquark channel,
showing that different low-temperature quark matter phases can occur at
intermediate densities: a normal quark matter (NQM) phase, a two-flavor
superconducting (2SC) quark matter phase and a mixed 2SC-NQM phase. Although in
most cases there is also a gapless 2SC phase, this occurs in general in a small
region at nonzero temperatures, thus its effect should be negligible for
compact star applications.

One particular advantage of matrix factorizations is that explicit moduli
dependence is built in, thus giving us full control over the open-string moduli
space. It allows one to study phenomena like discontinuous jumps of the
cohomology over the moduli space, as well as formation of bound states at
threshold. One interesting aspect is that certain gauge symmetries inherent to
the matrix formulation lead to a non-trivial global structure of the moduli
space. We also investigate topological tachyon condensation, which enables us
to construct, in a systematic fashion, higher-dimensional matrix factorizations
out of smaller ones; this amounts to obtaining branes with higher RR charges as
composites of ones with minimal charges. As an application, we explicitly
construct all rank-two matrix factorizations.

of genus >1 admits a holomorphically fillable contact structure. The
constructed example M satisfies the relation $2(\chi+e)=3\tau$ which is
necessary for the existence of a holomorphic section of the bundle, where
$\chi=\chi\Sigma$ stands for the Euler characteristic of $\Sigma$, e=eM, for
the Euler number of the bundle, and $\tau$, for the Toledo invariant. (The
relation is also valid for the series of examples constructed in [AGG].) Open
question: Does there exist a holomorphic section of the bundle M?

stochastic process (QSP) as a causally ordered operator field in an arbitrary
space-time region T of an open quantum system under a sequential observation at
a discrete space-time localization. It is shown that to every QSP described in
the weak sense by a self-consistent system of causally ordered correlation
kernels there corresponds a unique, up to unitary equivalence, minimal QSP in
the strong sense. It is shown that the proposed QSP construction, which reduces
in the case of the linearly ordered discrete T=Z to the construction of the
inductive limit of Lindblad's canonical representations, corresponds to
Kolmogorov's classical reconstruction if the order on T is ignored and leads to
Lewis construction if one uses the system of all (not only causal) correlation
kernels, regarding this system as lexicographically preordered on T. The
approach presented encompasses both nonrelativistic and relativistic
irreversible dynamics of open quantum systems and fields satisfying the
conditions of local commutativity and semigroup covariance. Also given are
necessary and sufficient conditions of dynamicity (or conditional Markovianity)

correction to the Casimir force between real metals has been hotly debated. As
was shown by several research groups, the Lifshitz theory, which provides the
theoretical foundation for the calculation of both the van der Waals and
Casimir forces, leads to different results depending on the model of metal
conductivity used. To resolve these controversies, the theoretical
considerations based on the principles of thermodynamics and new experimental
tests were invoked. We analyze the present status of the problem (in
particular, the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches based on the
surface impedance and on the Drude model dielectric function) using rigorous
analytical calculations of the entropy of a fluctuating field. We also discuss
the results of a new precise experiment on the determination of the Casimir
pressure between two parallel plates by means of a micromechanical torsional
oscillator.

generated between two parties, Alice and Bob, given assistance from a third
party, Charlie, when the three share a tripartite state and where the
assistance consists of Charlie initially performing a measurement on his share
and communicating the result to Alice and Bob through a one-way classical
channel. We argue that if this quantity is to be considered an operational
measure of entanglement, then it must be understood to be a tripartite rather
than a bipartite measure. We compare it with a distinct tripartite measure that
quantifies the entanglement that can be generated between Alice and Bob when
they are allowed to make use of a two-way classical channel with Charlie. We
show that the latter quantity, which we call the entanglement of collaboration,
can be greater than the entanglement of assistance. This demonstrates that the
entanglement of assistance (considered as a tripartite measure of
entanglement), and its multipartite generalizations such as the localizable
entanglement, are not entanglement monotones, thereby undermining their
operational significance.

Its solutions are eight-component spinors, which are interpreted as
single-particle fermion wave functions in four-dimensional spacetime. Use of a
``cylinder condition'' (the removal of explicit dependence on the fifth
coordinate) reduces each eight-component solution to a pair of degenerate
four-component spinors obeying the Dirac equation. This five-dimensional method
is used to obtain solutions for a free particle and for a particle moving in
the Coulomb potential. It is shown that, under the cylinder condition, the
results are the same as those from the Dirac equation. Without the cylinder
condition, on the other hand, the equation predicts some interesting new
phenomena. It implies the existence of a scalar potential, and for zero-mass
particles it leads to a four-dimensional fermionic equation analogous to
Maxwell's equation with sources.

  related material see http://freespace.virgin.net/ch.thompson1/",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recent proposed ``loophole-free'' Bell tests are discussed in the light of
classical models for the relevant features of optical parametric amplification
and homodyne detection. The Bell tests themselves are uncontroversial: there
are no obvious loopholes that might cause bias and hence, if the world does,
after all, obey local realism, no violation of a Bell inequality will be
observed. Interest centres around the question of whether or not the proposed
criterion for ``non-classical'' light is valid. If it is not, then the
experiments will fail in their initial concept, since both quantum theorists
and local realists will agree that we are seeing a purely classical effect. The
Bell test, though, is not the only criterion by which the quantum-mechanical
and local realist models can be judged. It is suggested that the
quantum-mechanical models given in the proposals will also fail in their
detailed predictions. If the experiments are extended by including a range of
parameter values and by analysing, in addition to the proposed digitised
voltage differences, the raw voltages, the models can be compared in their
overall performance and plausibility.
