evolution of million body star clusters. The new method treats each superstar
as a single star and follows the evolution and motion of all individual stellar
objects. A survey of the evolution of N-body systems influenced by the tidal
field of a parent galaxy and by stellar evolution is presented. The process of
energy generation is realized by means of appropriately modified versions of
Spitzer's and Mikkola's formulae for the interaction cross section between
binaries and field stars and binaries themselves. The results presented are in
good agreement with theoretical expectations and the results of other methods.
During the evolution, the initial mass function (IMF) changes significantly.
The local mass function (LMF) around the half--mass radius closely resembles
the actual global mass function (GMF). At the late stages of evolution the mass
of the evolved stars inside the core can be as high as 97% of the total mass in
this region. For the whole system, the evolved stars can compose up to 67% of
the total mass. The evolution of cluster anisotropy strongly depends on initial
cluster concentration, IMF and the strength of the tidal field. The results
presented are the first step in the direction of simulating the evolution of
real globular clusters by means of the Monte Carlo method.

L_{3000\AA/1350 \AA}$ relation. But for radio-loud AGNs, the mass estimated

freeze-out plays a crucial role in the chemistry. The behavior of other high

Radial density profiles in massive cores are fitted by power laws with indices
about -1.6, as derived from the dust continuum emission. The radial temperature
dependence on intermediate scales is close to the theoretically expected one

result in average metallicities that range from [Fe/H] = -1.3 to -0.9, with the
most metal poor halos resulting from accretion histories that lack destructive
mergers with massive (metal rich) satellites. Our stellar halo metallicities
increase with stellar halo mass. The slope of the [Fe/H]-stellar mass trend
mimics that of the satellite galaxies that were destroyed to build the halos,
implying that the relation propagates hierarchically. All simulated halos
contain a significant fraction of old stellar populations accreted more than 10
Gyr ago and in a few cases, some intermediate age populations exist. In
contrast with the Milky Way, many of our simulated stellar halos contain old
stellar populations which are metal rich, originating in the early accretion of
massive satellites. We suggest that the (metal rich) stellar halo of M31 falls
into this category, while the more metal poor halo of the Milky Way is lacking
in early massive accretion events. Interestingly, our hierarchically-formed
stellar halos often have non-negligible metallicity gradients in both [Fe/H]
and [alpha/Fe]. These gradients extend a few tens of kpc, and can be as large
as 0.5 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.2 dex in [alpha/Fe]. Finally, we find that chemical
abundances can act as a rough substitute for time of accretion of satellite
galaxies. We propose a criterion for identifying tidal streams spatially by
selecting stars with [alpha/Fe] ratios below solar.

through a horizontal alignment of elastic spheres of progressively decreasing
diameter $\phi_n$, namely a tapered chain. Experimentally, the diameters of
spheres which interact via the Hertz potential are selected to keep as close as
possible to an exponential decrease, $\phi_{n+1}=(1-q)\phi_n$, where the
experimental tapering factor is either $q_1\simeq5.60$~% or $q_2\simeq8.27$~%.
In agreement with recent numerical results, an impulse initiated in a
monodisperse chain (a chain of identical beads) propagates without shape
changes, and progressively transfer its energy and momentum to a propagating
tail when it further travels in a tapered chain. As a result, the front pulse
of this wave decreases in amplitude and accelerates. Both effects are
satisfactorily described by the hard spheres approximation, and basically, the
shock mitigation is due to partial transmissions, from one bead to the next, of
momentum and energy of the front pulse. In addition when small dissipation is
included, a better agreement with experiments is found. A close analysis of the
loading part of the experimental pulses demonstrates that the front wave adopts
itself a self similar solution as it propagates in the tapered chain. Finally,
our results corroborate the capability of these chains to thermalize
propagating impulses and thereby act as shock absorbing devices.

feature of the proposed model is the assumption that negatively charged arsenic

monotonically and slowly decreases as total arsenic concentration increases. In
the case of doubly negatively charged cluster incorporating two arsenic atoms,

feature of the problem is the appearance of a transverse component of the
induced current that converts the problem to a two-dimensional one. Bean's
critical state model for a superconductor and a low frequency approximation for
a metal are used. In the framework of this approximation the influence of eddy
currents in the metal on the magnetic field is neglected, and the current
distribution in the superconductor is determined by an external field. Two
cases were considered: (1) superconducting and metal strips electrically
separated; (2) they are in an electric contact. It is shown that for most
practical cases enough to take into account only the losses generated by
induced longitudinal currents in a composite strip. When an electric contact
between strips exists, the maximum loss density in high fields (above 2 T) can
be determined by the transverse component of the current.

  and Connections of Communication, Estimation, and Control","37 pages, 14 figures. The material in this paper was presented in
  part at the 43rd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and
  Computing, Monticello, IL, September 2005. This paper was submitted to IEEE
  Transactions on Information Theory in October, 2005",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  Gaussian channels with memory and with noiseless feedback have been widely
studied in the information theory literature. However, a coding scheme to
achieve the feedback capacity is not available. In this paper, a coding scheme
is proposed to achieve the feedback capacity for Gaussian channels. The coding
scheme essentially implements the celebrated Kalman filter algorithm, and is
equivalent to an estimation system over the same channel without feedback. It
reveals that the achievable information rate of the feedback communication
system can be alternatively given by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound of
the associated estimation system. Thus, combined with the control theoretic
characterizations of feedback communication (proposed by Elia), this implies
that the fundamental limitations in feedback communication, estimation, and
control coincide. This leads to a unifying perspective that integrates
information, estimation, and control. We also establish the optimality of the
Kalman filtering in the sense of information transmission, a supplement to the
optimality of Kalman filtering in the sense of information processing proposed
by Mitter and Newton. In addition, the proposed coding scheme generalizes the
Schalkwijk-Kailath codes and reduces the coding complexity and coding delay.
The construction of the coding scheme amounts to solving a finite-dimensional
optimization problem. A simplification to the optimal stationary input
distribution developed by Yang, Kavcic, and Tatikonda is also obtained. The
results are verified in a numerical example.

suppressed. However, this chiral suppression does not materialize itself at the
hadron level such as in decays into $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+K^-$, because in
perturbative QCD the glueball couples to two (but not one) light quark pairs
that hadronize to two mesons. Using QCD factorization based on an effective
Lagrangian, we show that the difference of hadronization into $\pi\pi$ and $KK$
already leads to a large difference between ${\rm Br} (\pi^+\pi^-)$ and ${\rm
Br}(K^+K^-)$, even the decay amplitude is not chirally suppressed. Moreover,
the small ratio of $R={\rm Br}(\pi\pi)/{\rm Br}(K\bar K)$ of $f_0(1710)$

  World Scientific Publishing co",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  We have performed individual-based lattice simulations of SIR and SEIR
dynamics to investigate both the short and long-term dynamics of childhood
epidemics. In our model, infection takes place through a combination of local
and long-range contacts, in practice generating a dynamic small-world network.
Sustained oscillations emerge with a period much larger than the duration of
infection. We found that the network topology has a strong impact on the
amplitude of oscillations and in the level of persistence. Diseases do not
spread very effectively through local contacts. This can be seen by measuring
an {\em effective} transmission rate $\beta_{\mbox {\scriptsize eff}}$ as well
as the basic reproductive rate $R_0$. These quantities are lower in the
small-world network than in an homogeneously mixed population, whereas the
average age at infection is higher.

considered that range from the rotationally invariant to highly anisotropic
spin models, have different topologies and values of parameters that are fixed
or are allowed to fluctuate randomly. We explore the conditions under which the
two-spin system clearly shows an evolution from the initial spin-up - spin-down
state towards the maximally entangled singlet state. We demonstrate that
frustration and, especially, glassiness of the spin environment strongly
enhances the decoherence of the two-spin system.

these criteria to demonstrate that efficient processing of the data contained
in single events is equivalent to the observation that Malus' law holds. A
strictly deterministic process that also yields Malus' law is analyzed in
detail. We present a performance analysis of the probabilistic and
deterministic model of the photon polarizer. The latter is an adaptive
dynamical system that has primitive learning capabilities. This additional
feature has recently been shown to be sufficient to perform event-by-event
simulations of interference phenomena, without using concepts of wave
mechanics. We illustrate this by presenting results for a system of two chained
Mach-Zehnder interferometers, suggesting that systems that perform efficient
data processing and have learning capability are able to exhibit behavior that
is usually attributed to quantum systems only.

which the wave function is spatiotemporally localized with finite spacetime
support, uniformly moving hence stationary. It turns out that the quantum
amplitude satisfies Klein-Gordon equation with emergent mass term proportional
to the square root of average quantum potential. We show that there is physical
time uncertainty which decreases as the mass increases. We also rederive the
classical energy-momentum relation provided the de Broglie-Einstein relation
holds. In this case, the time uncertainty is proportional to the inverse of
classical energy.
