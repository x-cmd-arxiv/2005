if the gravity provided by the energy sources therein is attractive and
accordingly one needs to invoke dark energy as a source of anti-gravity for
understanding the cosmic acceleration. To examine this point we find
counter-examples for a spherically symmetric dust fluid described by the
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solution without singularity. Thus, the validity of this
naive consensus is indeed doubtful and the effects of inhomogeneities should be
restudied. These counter-intuitive examples open a new perspective on the
understanding of the evolution of our universe.

a hybrid star. We discuss the possible mode of burning, using a fully
relativistic formalism and realistic Equations of State in which hyperons can
be present. We take into account the possibility that quarks form a diquark
condensate. We also discuss the formation of a mixed phase of hadrons and
quarks, and we indicate which region of the star can rapidly convert in various
possible scenarios. An estimate of the final temperature of the system is
provided. We find that the conversion process always corresponds to a
deflagration and never to a detonation. Hydrodynamical instabilities can
develop on the front. We estimate the increase in the conversion's velocity due
to the formation of wrinkles and we find that, although the increase is
significant, it is not sufficient to transform the deflagration into a
detonation in essentially all realistic scenarios. Concerning convection, it
does not always develop. In particular the system does not develop convection
if hyperons are not present in the initial phase and if the newly formed quark
phase is made of ungapped (or weakly gapped) quarks. At the contrary, the
process of conversion from ungapped quark matter to gapped quarks always allows
the formation of a convective layer. Finally, we discuss possible astrophysical
implications of our results.

from a primordial to present-day mode of star formation. We quantify this
relation through new calculations of the ionizing radiation produced in
association with the elements carbon, oxygen and silicon observed in Galactic
metal-poor halo stars, which are likely second-generation objects formed in the
wake of primordial supernovae. We demonstrate that sufficient ionizing photons
per baryon are created by enrichment levels of [Fe/H] of about -3 in the

microwave background of about 0.1 detected by $WMAP$. We show, on a star by

formation mode occurred at metallicities of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ solar in
these halo stars. This provides an important link in the chain of evidence for
metal-free first stars having dominated the process of reionization by redshift
6. We conclude that many of the Fe-poor halo stars formed close to the end of

1997, the observations of solar flares from SOHO did not show the seismic
waves, similar to the 1996 event, even for large X-class flares during the
solar maximum in 2000-2002. The first evidence of the seismic flare signal in
this solar cycle was obtained for the 2003 ``Halloween'' events, through
acoustic ``egression power'' by Donea and Lindsey. After these several other
strong sunquakes have been observed. Here, I present a detailed analysis of the
basic properties of the helioseismic waves generated by three solar flares in
2003-2005. For two of these flares, X17 flare of October 28, 2003, and X1.2

seismic waves and the hard X-ray source, indicating that high-energy electrons
accelerated during the flare impulsive phase produced strong compression waves
in the photosphere, causing the sunquake. The results also reveal new physical
properties such as strong anisotropy of the seismic waves, the amplitude of
which varies significantly with the direction of propagation. The waves travel
through surrounding sunspot regions to large distances, up to 120 Mm, without
significant decay. These observations open new perspectives for helioseismic

efficient simulations even at low temperatures and for strong interactions. As

are arbitrary, but the mixing angles are constrained in such a way that the
overall patterns are explained while also leaving sufficient freedom to fit the
detailed features of the observed values, including CP violating phases. The
scheme realises the proposal of Low and Volkas to generate zero quark mixing
and tribimaximal neutrino mixing at tree-level, with deviations from both
arising from small corrections after spontaneous A_4 breaking. In the neutrino
sector, the breaking is A_4 --> Z_2, while in the quark and charged-lepton
sectors it is A_4 --> Z_3 = C_3. The full theory has A_4 completely broken, but
the two different unbroken subgroups in the two sectors force the dominant
mixing patterns to be as stated above. Radiative effects within each sector are
shown to deviate neutrino mixing from tribimaximal, while maintaining zero
quark mixing. Interactions between the two sectors -- ""cross-talk"" -- induce
nonzero quark mixing, and additional deviation from tribimaximal neutrino
mixing. We discuss the vacuum alignment challenge the scenario faces, and
suggest three generic ways to approach the problem. We follow up one of those
ways by sketching how an explicit model realising the symmetry breaking
structure may be constructed.

approach, which is the subject of a subsequent paper. In both theories we
determine the ground ring of ghost zero physical operators by computing its OPE

in the representation theory of Lie algebras which are easily generalised to

representations of the AdS_4 algebra and group. We give explicitly all singular
(null) vectors of the reducible AdS_4 Verma modules. These are used to obtain
the AdS_4 invariant differential operators. Using this we display a new
structure - a diagram involving four partially equivalent reducible
representations one of which contains all finite-dimensional irreps of the
AdS_4 algebra. We study in more detail the cases involving UIRs, in particular,
the Di and the Rac singletons, and the massless UIRs. In the massless case we
discover the structure of sets of 2s_0-1 conserved currents for each spin s_0
UIR, s_0=1,3/2,... All massless cases are contained in a one-parameter
subfamily of the quartet diagrams mentioned above, the parameter being the spin
s_0. Further we give the classification of the so(5,C) irreps presented in a

paper concludes with a speculation on the possible applications of the

the central charge and an operator of negative dimension. We speculate that an

have been compared based on the number of nucleon participants and the number
of constituent quark (parton) participants. In both normalizations, we observe
that the charged particle densities in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions are similar
for both \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 62.4 and 200 GeV. This implies that in symmetric
nucleus-nucleus collisions the charged particle density does not depend on the
size of the two colliding nuclei but only on the collision energy. In the
nucleon participants framework, the particle density at mid-rapidity as well as
in the limiting fragmentation region from A+A collisions are higher than those
of p(\bar{p})+p collisions at the same energy. Also the integrated total
charged particle in A+A collisions as a function of number nucleon participants
is higher than p(\bar{p})+p collisions at the same energy indicating that there
is no smooth transition between peripheral A+A and nucleon-nucleon collisions.
However, when the comparison is made in the constituent quarks framework, A+A
and p(\bar{p})+p collisions exhibit a striking degree of agreement. The
observations presented in this paper imply that the number of constituent quark
pairs participating in the collision controls the particle production. One may
therefore conjecture that the initial states A+A and p+p collisions are similar
when the partonic considerations are used in normalization. Another interesting
result is that there is an overall factorization of dN/d\eta shapes as a
function of collision centrality between Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at the same
energy, \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV.

emitting nuclear states has been developed for fast beams from fragmentation
reactions. A test measurement was carried out with a beam of 124Xe at an energy
of ~55 MeV/u. The beam ions were Coulomb excited to the first 2+ state on a
movable target. Excited nuclei emerged from the target and decayed in flight
after a distance related to the lifetime. A stationary degrader positioned
downstream with respect to the target was used to further reduce the velocity
of the excited nuclei. As a consequence, the gamma-ray decays from the 2+
excited state that occurred before or after traversing the degrader were
measured at a different Doppler shift. The gamma-ray spectra were analyzed from
the forward ring of the Segmented Germanium Array; this ring positioned at 37
deg. simultaneously provides the largest sensitivity to changes in velocity and
the best energy resolution. The ratio of intensities in the peaks at different
Doppler shifts gives information about the lifetime if the velocity is
measured. The results and range of the application of the method are discussed.
