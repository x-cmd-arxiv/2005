direction of the z=0.03 Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 279. The high velocity cloud
Complex C lies along this line of sight, with HI 21-cm emission and OVI 1032\AA
absorption both observed at velocities of ~ -150 km/s relative to the local
standard of rest. We present an improved method for placing limits on the
Doppler parameter and column density of a medium when only one unresolved line
can be measured; this method is applied to the OVII absorption seen here,
indicating that the OVII Doppler parameter is inconsistent with that of any
low-velocity (Galactic thick disk) or high-velocity OVI (OVI_HV) component.
Direct association of the OVII with the OVI_HV is further ruled out by the high
temperatures required to produce the observed OVI_HV/OVII ratio and the
significant velocity difference between the OVII and OVI_HV lines. If the OVII
absorption is associated with a very broad, undetected OVI component, then the
absorption must be broadened by primarily nonthermal processes. The large
velocity dispersion and possible slight redshift of the OVII absorption (as
well as limits on the absorber's temperature and density) may be indicative of
a local intergalactic medium origin, though absorption from a hot, low-density
Galactic corona cannot be ruled out.

suggestive evidences for non-stationarity in the temporal properties of 3C

variability decreases as the energy spectrum of the source softens. However,
only the non-linear, ""scaling index method"" is able to show conclusively that
the temporal characteristics of the source do vary, although the physical
interpretation of this result is not clear at the moment. Our results indicate
that the variability properties of 3C 390.3 may vary with time, in the same way
as they do in Galactic black holes in the hard state, strengthening the analogy
between the X-ray variability properties of the two types of object. This is
the first time that such a behavior is detected in an AGN X-ray light curve.
Further work is needed in order to investigate whether this is a common

wind plus a third wind reflecting the motion through the ISM. Simulations at
various velocities of the central star relative to the ISM indicate that a high

most of the structure already forms during the AGB phase. The closure of the
ring arises from the slow--fast wind interaction. Most of the mass lost on the
AGB has been swept downstream, providing a potential explanation of the missing
mass problem in PNe. We report a proper motion for the central star of 30 mas
yr^-1 in the direction of the bright limb, implying a distance to the nebula of

anisotropic neutrino emission and study the effects of these neutrino-driven
kicks on the supernova explosion. We find that if the collapsed star is
marginally unable to produce an explosion, the neutrino-driven mechanisms can
drive the convection to make a successful explosion. The resultant explosion is
asymmetric, with the strongest ejecta motion roughly in the direction of the
neutron star kick. This is in sharp contrast with the ejecta-driven mechanisms,
which predict the motion of the ejecta in the opposite direction. This
difference can be used to distinguish between the two mechanisms based on the
observations of the supernova remnants.

Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio sources are a direct consequence of their youth, but
in later stages of their evolution they are believed to become large-scale
sources. However, this notion was established mainly for strong CSS sources. In
this series of papers we test this paradigm on 60 weaker objects selected from
the VLA FIRST survey. They have 5-GHz flux densities in the range 150 <
S_{5GHz} < 550 mJy and steep spectra in the range 0.365 \le \nu \le 5 GHz. The
present paper is focused on sources that fulfill the above criteria and have
angular sizes in the range 0.2\arcsec - 1\arcsec. Observations of 19 such
sources were obtained using MERLIN in ""snapshot"" mode at 5 GHz. They are
presented along with 1.7-GHz VLBA and 5-GHz EVN follow-up snapshot observations
made for the majority of them. For one of the sources in this subsample,
1123+340, a full-track 5-GHz EVN observation was also carried out. This study
provides an important element to the standard theory of CSS sources, namely
that in a number of them the activity of their host galaxies probably switched
off quite recently and their further growth has been stopped because of that.
In the case of 1123+340, the relic of a compact ""dead source"" is particularly
well preserved by the presence of intracluster medium of the putative cluster
of galaxies surrounding it. The observed overabundance of compact sources can
readily be explained in the framework of the scenario of ""premature"" cessation
of the activity of the host galaxy nucleus. It could also explain the
relatively low radio flux densities of many such sources and, in a few cases,
their peculiar, asymmetric morphologies. We propose a new interpretation of
such asymmetries based on the light-travel time argument.

suggesting that about 70% of the neutral gas has been ejected from them.We
present deep broad-band optical images, together with narrow band H$\alpha$ CCD

images reveal interaction features between both systems and strong H$\alpha$
emission in the inner part of IRAS 08339+6517. The chemical composition of the
ionized gas of the galaxies is rather similar. The analysis of their kinematics
also indicates interaction features and reveals an object that could be a
candidate tidal dwarf galaxy or a remnant of an earlier merger. Our data
suggest that the \ion{H}{i} tail has been mainly formed from material stripped
from the main galaxy. We find weak spectral features that could be attributed
to the presence of Wolf--Rayet stars in this starburst galaxy and estimate an
age of the most recent burst of around 4 -- 6 Myr. A more evolved underlying
stellar population, with a minimal age between 100 -- 200 Myr, is also detected
and fits an exponential intensity profile. A model which combines 85% young and
15% old populations can explain both the spectral energy distribution and the
\ion{H}{i} Balmer and \ion{He}{i} absorption lines presented in our spectrum.

(3935, 3970) absorption line systems selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS DR4) to show that on average, with conservative assumptions regarding
metallicities and dust-to-gas ratios, they contain column densities of neutral
hydrogen greater than the damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) limit. We propose that
selection by CaII absorption is an effective way of identifying high column
densities of neutral hydrogen, and thus large samples of DLAs at z<1.3 from the
SDSS. The number density of strong CaII absorbers (with rest-frame equivalent
width W_3935>0.5AA), is ~20-30% that of DLAs, after correcting for the
significant bias against their detection due to obscuration of the background
quasars by dust. On average these absorbers have E(B-V)>0.1mag; the dustiest
absorbers show depletions of refractory elements at a level of the largest
depletions seen in DLAs. For the first time we can measure the dust-to-metals
ratio in a sample of absorption selected galaxies, and find values close to, or
even larger than, those observed locally. All of these properties suggest that
a substantial fraction of the CaII absorbers are more chemically evolved than
typical DLAs. From consideration of the E(B-V) distribution in our sample, and
assuming CaII absorbers represent a subset of DLAs, we calculate that dust
obscuration causes an underestimation in the number density of DLAs by at least
8-12% at these redshifts. Finally, the removal of Broad Absorption Line (BAL)
quasars from the SDSS quasar sample increases the sensitivity of the detection
of reddening by intervening absorbers. To this end, we describe a new,
automated, principal component analysis (PCA) method for identifying BAL
quasars. [abridged]

over clouds without active star formation has been thought to indicate that
molecular clouds are ""short-lived"" and that star formation is ""rapid"". We show
that this statistical argument lacks self-consistency and, even within the
rapid star-formation scenario, implies cloud lifetimes of approximately 10 Myr.
We discuss additional observational evidence from external galaxies that
indicate lifetimes of molecular clouds and a timescale of star formation of
approximately 10 Myr . These long cloud lifetimes in conjunction with the rapid
(approximately 1 Myr) decay of supersonic turbulence present severe
difficulties for the scenario of turbulence-controlled star formation. By
contrast, we show that all 31 existing observations of objects for which the
linewidth, the size, and the magnetic field strength have been reliably
measured are in excellent quantitative agreement with the predictions of the
ambipolar-diffusion theory. Within the ambipolar-diffusion-controlled star
formation theory the linewidths may be attributed to large-scale non-radial
cloud oscillations (essentially standing large-amplitude, long-wavelength
Alfven waves), and the predicted relation between the linewidth, the size, and
the magnetic field is a natural consequence of magnetic support of
self-gravitating clouds.

subset of the local FP. The edge-on projection (approximately M vs M/L) is
indistinguishable from that of normal early-type galaxies. However -- within
the fundamental plane -- the lens galaxies appear to concentrate at the edge of
the region populated by normal early-type galaxies. We show that this is a
result of our selection procedure (approximately velocity dispersion
sigma>240km/s). We conclude that SLACS lenses are a fair sample of high

velocity dispersion that of the best fit lens model, we find

Relativity Resolves.."" are provided. It is emphasized that our model is
entirely natural to describe the dynamics of an axially symmetric galaxy and
that our solution, albeit idealized, contains the essence of the problem. The
discontinuity of the metric derivative on the symmetry plane is necessarily
interpreted as the effect of the mathematically idealized discontinuity of the
gradient of the density and is shown to be naturally connected to the
distributed volume density via the Gauss divergence theorem. We present
arguments to the effect that for our approximate weak field model, we can
choose the physically satisfactory mass distribution without an accompanying
singular mass surface layer. To support this contention, we modify our solution
slightly by removing the discontinuity with a region of continuous density
gradient overlapping the $z=0$ plane. The alternative of invoking a surface
layer leads to the presence of a negative mass surface layer approaching the
numerical value of the positive mass continuous region. This is in
contradiction with the assumed stationarity of the model. We find that a test
particle behaves normally as it approaches the $z=0$ plane, the acceleration
being towards the direction of this plane. This is in contradiction to the
negative mass layer hypothesis as negative mass would repel the test particle.
Thus, further support is added to the integrity of our original model.

is extended along the N-S direction. Previous imaging studies have shown the
extended regions are located inside the ionization cones indicating that the
mid-infrared emission arises perhaps from the inner regions of the narrow-line
clouds instead of the proposed dusty torus itself. The spatially resolved
mid-IR spectra were obtained at two different slit position angles, +8.0 and
-13.0 degrees across the elongated regions in the mid-IR. From these spectra,
we found only weak silicate absorption toward the northern extended regions but
strong in the nucleus and the southern extended regions. This is consistent
with a model of a slightly inclined cold obscuring torus which covers much of
the southern regions but is behind the northern extension. While a detailed
analysis of the spectra requires a radiative transfer model, the lack of
silicate emission from the northern extended regions prompts us to consider a
dual dust population model as one of the possible explanations in which a
different dust population exists in the ionization cones compared to that in
the dusty torus. Dust inside the ionization cones may lack small silicate
grains giving rise to only a featureless continuum in the northern extended
regions while dust in the dusty torus has plenty of small silicate grains to
produce the strong silicate absorption lines towards the nucleus and the
southern extended regions.

curves are expressed as functions both of exponential disk scale lengths r_d
and of optical radii Ropt, and extend out to 4.5-6.5 r_d, depending on the
luminosity bin. The two parameterizations yield slightly different results
beyond Ropt because galaxies whose Halpha emission can be traced to larger
extents in the disks are typically of higher optical surface brightness and are
characterized by larger values of Ropt/r_d. By either parameterization, these
template rotation curves show no convincing evidence of velocity decline within
the spatial scales over which they are sampled, even in the case of the most
luminous systems. In contrast to some previous expectations, the fastest
rotators (most luminous galaxies) have, on average, rotation curves that are
flat or mildly rising beyond the optical radius, implying that the dark matter
halo makes an important contribution to the kinematics also in these systems.

quantitative constraints for studies of the structure and evolution of disk

elongated like the LMC bar and the position angle (PA) of the elongation is
estimated to be 112.$^o$5 $\pm$ 15.$^o$3. This value of PA is found to be same
as the PA$_{maj}$ of the bar, within the errors, estimated using red clump
stars and giants. The ellipticity of their density distribution is estimated to
be $\sim$ 0.5, very similar to the ellipticity of the bar, estimated from
giants. The above results show that majority of the population of RRLS in the
central region of the LMC are found to have the signature of the bar. This
result could mean that most of these stars are located in the disk, considering
the bar as a disk feature. On the other hand, their scale-height was found to
be 3.0$\pm 0.9$ kpc. This indicates that RRLS are located in the halo and not

morphology, variability and information available from different wavelengths,
we categorize them as seventeen Galactic sources (4 unresolved, 7 extended, 6
extended sources in diffuse region) and seven extragalactic sources (2

three unresolved sources, viz IGR J17303$-$0601, IGR J17464$-$3213, and IGR

particular, the results are substantially more accurate than those provided by

heat-flux and shear-stress Knudsen numbers. Analytical solutions are found for
inverse-power-law molecules from hard-sphere through Maxwell at small Knudsen
numbers using Chapman-Enskog (CE) theory and for Maxwell molecules at finite
Knudsen numbers using a moment-hierarchy (MH) method. Corresponding numerical
solutions are obtained using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of
Bird. The thermal conductivity, the viscosity, and the Sonine-polynomial
coefficients of the velocity distribution function from DSMC agree with CE
results at small Knudsen numbers and with MH results at finite Knudsen numbers.
Subtle differences between inverse-power-law, variable-soft-sphere, and
variable-hard-sphere representations of Maxwell molecules are observed. The MH
and DSMC results both indicate that the effective thermal conductivity and the
effective viscosity for Maxwell molecules are independent of the heat-flux
Knudsen number, and additional DSMC simulations indicate that these transport
properties for hard-sphere molecules decrease slightly as the heat-flux Knudsen
number is increased. Similarly, the MH and DSMC results indicate that the
effective thermal conductivity and the effective viscosity for Maxwell
molecules decrease as the shear-stress Knudsen number is increased, and
additional DSMC simulations indicate the same behavior for hard-sphere
molecules. These results provide strong evidence that the DSMC method can be

decoupled in the zero-sound channel and is then mediated by a collective

zero-momentum component of the bosonic field is then closely related to the
fermionic density. This can be exploited to calculate the compressibility of
the interacting system. By using a cutoff in the bosonic propagator, the RG can
be set up such that the self-consistent Hartree approximation is imposed as

addition to its mass and charge. Of late there has been considerable interest
in developing electronic devices based on the transport of spin, which offer
potential advantages in dissipation, size, and speed over charge-based devices.
However, these advantages bring with them additional complexity. Because each
electron carries a single, fixed value (-e) of charge, the electrical current
carried by a gas of electrons is simply proportional to its total momentum. A
fundamental consequence is that the charge current is not affected by
interactions that conserve total momentum, notably collisions among the
electrons themselves. In contrast, the electron's spin along a given spatial
direction can take on two values, ""up"" and ""down"", so that the spin current and
momentum need not be proportional. Although the transport of spin polarization
is not protected by momentum conservation, it has been widely assumed that,
like the charge current, spin current is unaffected by electron-electron (e-e)
interactions. Here we demonstrate experimentally not only that this assumption
is invalid, but that over a broad range of temperature and electron density,
the flow of spin polarization in a two-dimensional gas of electrons is
controlled by the rate of e-e collisions.

scaling analysis, the deformation mode and stability properties of elastic caps
with a non-uniform thickness profile. By suitably scaling the mean thickness
and the contact angle between crust and substrate, we find data collapse onto a
master curve for both buckling pressure and deformation mode, thus allowing us
to predict when the deformed shape is a dimple, mexican hat, and so on. This
master curve is parameterised by a dimensionless measure of the non-uniformity
of the shell. We also speculate on how overlapping timescales for gelation and
deformation may alter our findings.

realistically simulated by molecular dynamics of the Lennard-Jones fluid. The

This is a pure-jump stochastic process induced, under coarse graining, by the
deterministic time evolution of the atomic coordinates. We discuss the Markov
hypothesis by analyzing the statistical properties of the jumps and of the
waiting times between jumps. In the limit of a vanishing integration time-step,
the distribution of waiting times becomes closer to an exponential and,
therefore, the continuous-time jump stochastic process is Markovian. The random
variable Delta z behaves as a Markov chain and, in the gas phase, the observed
transition probabilities follow the predictions of the Ehrenfest theory.

evolution equations describing one dimensional pattern-forming systems. This
criterion allows one to discriminate between the situation where a coarsening
process takes place and the one where the wavelength is fixed in the course of
time. An intermediate scenario may occur, namely `interrupted coarsening'. The
power of the criterion lies in the fact that the statement about the occurrence
of coarsening, or selection of a length scale, can be made by only inspecting
the behavior of the branch of steady state periodic solutions. The criterion
states that coarsening occurs if lambda'(A)>0 while a length scale selection
prevails if lambda'(A)<0, where $lambda$ is the wavelength of the pattern and A
is the amplitude of the profile. This criterion is established thanks to the
analysis of the phase diffusion equation of the pattern. We connect the phase
diffusion coefficient D(lambda) (which carries a kinetic information) to
lambda'(A), which refers to a pure steady state property. The relationship
between kinetics and the behavior of the branch of steady state solutions is
established fully analytically for several classes of equations. Another
important and new result which emerges here is that the exploitation of the
phase diffusion coefficient enables us to determine in a rather straightforward
manner the dynamical coarsening exponent. Our calculation, based on the idea
that |D(lambda)|=lambda^2/t, is exemplified on several nonlinear equations,
showing that the exact exponent is captured. Some speculations about the
extension of the present results to higher dimension are outlined.

  Given two sheaves on a Grothendieck topology, their ""cohomological

the depth complexity of Boolean functions by the cohomological complexity of
sheaves on a Grothendieck topology. We propose that the logical AND of two

in terms of those of the two functions using ``virtual zero extensions.'' We
propose that the logical negation of a function will have its corresponding
cohomological complexity equal to that of the original function using duality
theory. We explain these approaches and show that they are stable under
pullbacks and base change. It is the subject of ongoing work to achieve AND and
negation bounds simultaneously in a way that yields an interesting depth lower

For this, we find that SM non-singlet exotics must be present in the spectrum.
We also prove that the pure $U(1)_X$ anomalies can always be solved with
rationally charged fields, but that a large number of SM singlets are often
required. For $U(1)_X$ charges that are consistent with an embedding of the
MSSM in SU(5) or SO(10), we show that the $U(1)_X$ charges of the MSSM states

strongly on the renormalization effects whose size can vary with the choice of

low energy. While the renormalization group effects generally lead to additive
contribution on top of the shift, we show that the threshold corrections which

matrices of all fermions to the leading order, ($ii$) the SU(5) relation
$M_d=M_l^T$ exists between the mass matrices of the down quarks and the charged
leptons, and ($iii$) $M_d^\dagger=M_d$. These assumptions automatically lead to
different mixing patterns for quarks and leptons: quarks remain unmixed to
leading order ($i. e. V_{CKM}=1$) while leptons have non-trivial mixing given
by a symmetric unitary matrix $V^0_{PMNS} = V^T V$. $V$ depends on two physical
mixing angles and for values of these angles $\sim 20^\circ-25 ^\circ$ it
reproduces the observed mixing patterns rather well. We identify conditions
under which the universal mixing $V$ follows from the universal mass matrices
of fermions. Relatively small perturbations to the leading order structure lead
to the CKM mixing and corrections to $V^0_{PMNS}$. We find that if the
correction matrix equals the CKM matrix, the resulting lepton mixing agrees
well with data and predicts $\sin \theta_{13} > 0.08$. In a more general
context, the assumption of partial universality ($i.e.$, different mixing for

  geometric factors referred to in hep-ph/0510076",,,,"hep-ph",,"  According to the theory of quantum electrodynamics, photon-photon scattering
can take place via exchange of virtual electron-positron pairs. Effectively,
the interaction can be formulated in terms of non-linear corrections to
Maxwell's equations, and hence may be treated by classical non-linear
electrodynamics. Due to the strong electromagnetic fields needed to reach any
noticeable effect, photon-photon scattering has not yet been observed
experimentally, but recent improvements in laser technology have increased the
possibility of direct detection. A verification of the phenomena would be of
great scientific value as a confirmation of quantum electrodynamics. In this
thesis the possibility of direct detection of elastic photon-photon scattering
through four-wave coupling is investigated, both for current and future
systems. It is shown how three colliding laser pulses satisfying certain
matching conditions, can generate scattered radiation in a fourth resonant
direction. The interaction is modeled, and the number of scattered photons is
estimated for optimized configurations of incoming pulses, both for the Vulcan
laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory as well as for the planned XFEL at
DESY. An experiment using the Vulcan laser is predicted to produce 22 scattered
photons per shot, an amount which is definitely detectable. The usefulness of
the XFEL highly depends on future developments in laser technology, but a
realistic estimation gives a result of 30000 scattered photons per second.

exhibit a novel non-perturbative non-critical string configuration which

consistent with string scattering amplitudes. The dilaton configuration is
logarithmic in terms of the string coordinate X^0, and the amplitude of the

D; for D=4, the corresponding Universe, in the Einstein frame, is static and

decelerating Universe, reaching asymptotically (in Einstein time) the Minkowski
Universe. Moreover, the well-known linear (in terms of X^0) dilaton background,

non trivial fixed point for early times. This feature explains the time

it is necessary to specify a vacuum state. In order that this vacuum be
supersymmetric, it is well known that all field expectation values must be
along so-called flat directions, leaving the F- and D-terms of the scalar
potential to be zero. The situation becomes particularly interesting when one
attempts to realize such directions while assigning VEVS to fields transforming
under non-Abelian representations of the gauge group. Since the expectation
value is now shared among multiple components of a field, satisfaction of
flatness becomes an inherently geometrical problem in the group space.
Furthermore, the possibility emerges that a single seemingly dangerous F-term
might experience a self-cancellation among its components. The hope exists that
the geometric language can provide an intuitive and immediate recognition of
when the D and F conditions are simultaneously compatible, as well as a
powerful tool for their comprehensive classification. This is the avenue
explored in this paper, and applied to the cases of SU(2) and SO(2N), relevant
respectively to previous attempts at reproducing the MSSM and the flipped SU(5)
GUT. Geometrical interpretation of non-Abelian flat directions finds
application to M-theory through the recent conjecture of equivalence between
D-term strings and wrapped D-branes of Type II theory. Knowledge of the
geometry of the flat direction ""landscape"" of a D-term string model could yield
information about the dual brane model. It is hoped that the techniques
encountered will be of benefit in extending the viability of the
quasi-realistic phenomenologies already developed.

well, however, when $n > \sqrt{\ell (\ell + 1) -2} - 1$ in the effective
potential makes the decreasing behavior of the total absorption with increasing
$n$ in the low-energy regime. The high-energy limit of the total absorption
cross section seems to coincide with that of the brane-localized scalar cross
section. The increasing rate of the graviton emission is very large compared to

field are found in four dimensions in the presence of a cosmological constant.
If a quartic self-interaction term for the scalar field is considered, there is
a solution describing an asymptotically locally AdS charged black hole dressed
with a scalar field that is regular on and outside the event horizon, which is
a surface of negative constant curvature. This black hole can have negative
mass, which is bounded from below for the extremal case, and its causal
structure shows that the solution describes a ""black hole inside a black hole"".
The thermodynamics of the non-extremal black hole is analyzed in the grand
canonical ensemble. The entropy does not follow the area, and there is an
effective Newton constant which depends on the value of the scalar field at the
horizon. If the base manifold is locally flat, the solution has no electric
charge, and the scalar field has a vanishing stress-energy tensor so that it
dresses a locally AdS spacetime with a nut at the origin. In the case of
vanishing selfinteraction, the solutions also dress locally AdS spacetimes, and
if the base manifold is of negative constant curvature a massless electrically
charged hairy black hole is obtained. The thermodynamics of this black hole is
also analyzed. It is found that the bounds for the black holes parameters in

show that failure of these properties is equivalent to certain seemingly

  Second, we construct two comparison homomorphisms between Lagrangian and

to be the natural analogs to the homomorphisms in singular homology induced by

structure theorem, generalising Schneider's Theorem II [H.-J. Schneider, Israel
J. Math., 72 (1990), 167--195], is proven. This is then applied to the $C$-ring
associated to a weak entwining structure and a structure theorem for a weak
$A$-Galois coextension is derived. The theory of matrix ring contexts for a
firm coalgebra (or {\em infinite matrix ring contexts}) is outlined. A Galois

(Charney--Hasegawa--Mima) model is shown to be strongly dependent on the Rossby
deformation wavenumber $\lambda$ (or free-surface elasticity). Herein, we
derive a bound on the inverse energy transfer, specifically on the growth rate
$\d\ell/\dt$ of the characteristic length scale $\ell$ representing the energy
centroid. It is found that $\d\ell/\dt\le2\norm q_\infty/(\ell_s\lambda^2)$,
where $\norm q_\infty$ is the supremum of the potential vorticity and $\ell_s$
represents the potential enstrophy centroid of the reservoir, both invariant.
This result implies that in the potential energy dominated regime
($\ell\ge\ell_s\gg\lambda^{-1}$), the inverse energy transfer is strongly
impeded, in the sense that under the usual time scale no significant transfer
of energy to larger scales occurs. The physical implication is that the
elasticity of the free surface impedes turbulent energy transfer in wavenumber
space, effectively rendering large-scale vortices long-lived and inactive.
Results from numerical simulations of forced-dissipative turbulence confirm
this prediction.

  Fluctuations","8 pages, 5 figures. To appear in the Quark Matter 2005 Poster
  Proceedings in Nukleonika",,,,"nucl-ex",,"  A simple way to visualize event-by-event average $p_T$ fluctuations is by
assuming that each collision has a different temperature parameter (inverse
$p_T$ slope) and that the ensemble of events has a temperature distribution
about the mean, $<T>$, with standard deviation $\sigma_T$. PHENIX characterizes
the non-random fluctuation of $M_{p_T}$, the event-by-event average $p_T$, by
$F_{p_T}$, the fractional difference of the standard deviation of the data from
that of a random sample obtained with mixed events. This can be related to the
temperature fluctuation:
  \[ F_{p_T}=\sigma^{\rm data}_{M_{p_T}}/\sigma^{\rm
random}_{M_{p_T}}-1\simeq(< n > -1) \sigma^2_{T}/< T>^2 \]
  Combining this with the Gavai, {\it et al.},\cite{Gavai05} and Korus, {\it et
al.},\cite{Korus} definitions of the specific heat per particle, a simple
relationship is obtained:
  \[ c_v/T^3={\mean{n}\over \mean{N_{tot}}} {1\over F_{p_T}} \]
  $F_{p_T}$ is measured with a fraction $\mean{n}/\mean{N_{tot}}$ of the total
particles produced, a purely geometrical factor representing the fractional
acceptance, $\sim 1/33$ in PHENIX. Gavai, {\it et al.} predict that
$c_v/T^3=15$, which corresponds to $F_{p_T}\sim 0.20$% in PHENIX, which may be
accessible by measurements of $M_{p_T}$ in the range $0.2\leq p_T\leq 0.6$
GeV/c. In order to test the Gavai, {\it et al.} prediction that $c_v/T^3$ is
reduced in a QGP compared to the ideal gas value (15 compared to 21), precision
measurements of $F_{p_T}$ in the range 0.20% for $0.2\leq p_T\leq 0.6$ GeV/c
may be practical.

margin: the equatorial western Africa and the SW Africa margins, helps in
analysing the main controlling factors on their development. Early Cretaceous
active rifting S of the Walvis Ridge resulted in the formation of the SW Africa
volcanic margin. The non-volcanic rifting N of the Walvis ridge, led to the
formation of the equatorial western Africa margin, with thick and extensive,
synrift basins. Regressive erosion of SW Africa prominent shoulder uplift
accounts for high clastic sedimentation rate in Late Cretaceous - Eocene, while
dominant carbonate production on equatorial western Africa shelf suggests
little erosion of a low hinterland. The early Oligocene climate change had
contrasted response in both margins. Emplacement of the Congo deep-sea fan
reflects increased erosion in equatorial Africa, under the influence of wet
climate, whereas establishment of an arid climate over SW Africa induced a
drastic decrease of denudation, and thus reduced sedimentation on the margin.
Neogene emplacement of the African superswell beneath S. Africa renewed onshore
uplift on both margins, but it accelerated erosion only in the Congo catchment,
due to wetter climate. Neogene high sedimentation rate reactivated
gravitational tectonics that had remained quiescent since late Cretaceous.

hibernation, irrespective of environmental conditions [1]. In a (genetically)
uniform population a typically very small subpopulation becomes metabolically
inactive whereas the majority subpopulation remains active and grows. Bacteria
such as E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-superbug), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1-3] show persistence. It can render
bacteria less vulnerable in adverse environments [1, 4, 5] and their effective
eradication through medication more difficult [2, 3, 6]. Here we show that
medication treatment regimes may have to be modified when persistence is taken
into account and characterize optimal approaches assuming that the total
medication dose is constrained. The determining factors are cumulative
toxicity, eradication power of the medication and bacterial response
timescales. Persistent organisms have to be fought using tailored eradication
strategies which display two fundamental characteristics. Ideally, the
treatment time should be significantly longer than in the case of persistence
with the medication uniformly spread out over time; however, if treatment time
has to be limited, then the application of medication has to be concentrated
towards the beginning and end of the treatment. These findings deviate from
current clinical practice, and may therefore help to optimize and simplify
treatments. Our use of multi-objective optimization [7] to map out the optimal
strategies can be generalized to other related problems.

that for stretching at constant speed. A more complicated time dependence
arises for integrin.

theorems, entanglement distillation, etc., which characterize asymptotic
properties of quantum and classical channels and states. In this paper we
advocate a unified approach to an important class of problems in quantum
Shannon theory, consisting of those that are bipartite, unidirectional and
memoryless.
  We formalize two principles that have long been tacitly understood. First, we
describe how the Church of the larger Hilbert space allows us to move flexibly
between states, channels, ensembles and their purifications. Second, we
introduce finite and asymptotic (quantum) information processing resources as
the basic objects of quantum Shannon theory and recast the protocols used in
direct coding theorems as inequalities between resources. We develop the rules
of a resource calculus which allows us to manipulate and combine resource
inequalities. This framework simplifies many coding theorem proofs and provides
structural insights into the logical dependencies among coding theorems.
  We review the above-mentioned basic coding results and show how a subset of
them can be unified into a family of related resource inequalities. Finally, we
use this family to find optimal trade-off curves for all protocols involving
one noisy quantum resource and two noiseless ones.

the condition $m=2^{n}$ ($n=1,2,...$). The circuit is composed of units called
multi-qubits gates (MQGs), each of which performs $m$ $C^{2}$-NOT operations
simultaneously on $3m$ qubits. Simultaneous operations eliminate the need to
manipulate qubits individually, as required in conventional quantum circuits.
The proposed circuit thus represents a more realistic mode of operation for
practical computing systems. A nuclear magnetic resonance implementation of the
