empirical and simulated data to be capable of detecting binary companions that
are fainter by up to 6 magnitudes at separations larger than 0.1 arcsec. The
nine targets that were previously known to be a binary are all detected. In
addition, we report the discovery of 6 new binaries and present 5 further
possible binaries. The resulting binary fraction of 68+/-11 per cent is the
largest reported for any observed sample of Herbig Ae/Be stars, presumably
because of the exquisite sensitivity of spectro-astrometry for detecting binary
systems. The data hint that the binary frequency of the Herbig Be stars is
larger than for the Herbig Ae stars. The appendix presents model simulations to
assess the capabilities of spectro-astrometry and reinforces the empirical
findings. Two objects, HD 87643 and Z CMa, display evidence for asymmetric
outflows. Finally, the position angles of the binary systems have been compared
with available orientations of the circumprimary disc and these appear to be
co-planar. The alignment between the circumprimary discs and the binary systems
strongly suggests that the formation of binaries with intermediate mass
primaries is due to fragmentation as the alternative, stellar capture, does not
naturally predict aligned discs. The aligment extends to the most massive
B-type stars in our sample. This leads us to conclude that formation mechanisms
that do result in massive stars, but predict random angles beween the binaries
and the circumprimary disks, such as stellar collisions, are also ruled out for
the same reason.

The value of the transition radius (~225 Schwarzschild radii) between the RIAF

Balmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk. The black hole
mass was inferred from measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the

the accretion flow model are consistent with each other. A small remaining
excess in the near-UV is accounted by the contribution of an obscured starburst
located within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported in an earlier paper. The
radio flux is consistent with synchrotron emission of a relativistic jet
modeled by means of the internal shock scenario. In an appendix we also analyze

observations with Chandra (2 Ms and 1 Ms, respectively). We measure the
unresolved CXB intensity by extracting spectra of the sky, removing all point
and extended sources detected in the CDF. To model and subtract the
instrumental background, we use observations obtained with ACIS in stowed
position, not exposed to the sky. The unresolved signal in the 0.5-1 keV band
is dominated by diffuse Galactic and local thermal-like emission. In the 1-8
keV band, the unresolved spectrum is adequately described by a power law with a
photon index 1.5. We find unresolved CXB intensities of (1.04+/-0.14)x10^-12
ergs cm^-2 s^-1 deg^-2 for the 1-2 keV band and (3.4+/-1.7)x10^-12 ergs cm^-2
s^-1 deg^-2 for the 2-8 keV band. Our detected unresolved intensities in these
bands significantly exceed the expected flux from sources below the CDF
detection limits, if one extrapolates the logN/logS curve to zero flux. Thus
these background intensities imply either a genuine diffuse component, or a
steepening of the logN/logS curve at low fluxes, most significantly for
energies <2 keV. Adding the unresolved intensity to the total contribution from
sources detected in these fields and wider-field surveys, we obtain a total
intensity of the extragalactic CXB of (4.6+/-0.3)x10^-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 deg^-2
for 1-2 keV and (1.7+/-0.2)x10^-11 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 deg^-2 for 2-8 keV. These

line formation, the abundances are lowered to [O/Fe] = 2.8 and [O/Fe] = 2.5,

would be in disagreement with the upper limits derived from the OI triplet

percent. Even if a dispersive phase is present, we show that it does not bias
the measured Fourier visibility estimate. An upper limit of 0.005 for the

advantage of the intrinsic contrast stability to test a new astronomical
prodecure for calibrating diameters of simple stars by simultaneously fitting
the instrumental contrast and the apparent stellar diameters. This method
reaches an accuracy with diameter errors of the order of previous ones but
without the need of an already known calibrator. These results are an important

the gas in at least one component. Here we use high-resolution STIS UV spectra
that resolve the two velocity components in absorption and determine the
conditions in each. We derive a volume hydrogen density, 21 cm spin
temperature, turbulent velocity, and kinetic temperature, for each. We combine
these estimates with magnetic field measurements to find that magnetic energy
significantly dominates turbulent and thermal energies in one component, while
the other component is close to equipartition between turbulent and magnetic
energies. We observe molecular hydrogen absorption for highly excited v, J
levels that are photoexcited by the stellar continuum, and detect blueshifted S
III and P III. These ions must arise from ionized gas between the mostly
neutral portions of the Veil and the Trapezium and shields the Veil from
ionizing radiation. We find that this layer of ionized gas is also responsible
for He I absorption in the Veil, which resolves a 40-year-old debate on the
origin of He I absorption towards the Trapezium. Finally, we determine that the

collisionless shocks and apply our results to external shocks in gamma-ray

instability (TWI) generates a small-scale magnetic field that facilitates
collisional coupling and thermalization in the shock transition. The TWI field
is expected to decay rapidly, over a finite number of proton plasma skin depths
from the transition. However, the synchrotron emission in GRB afterglows
suggests that a strong and persistent magnetic field is present in the plasma
that crosses the shock; the origin of this field is a key open question. Here
we suggest that the common picture involving TWI demands revision. Namely, the
CRs drive turbulence in the shock upstream on scales much larger than the skin
depth. This turbulence generates a large-scale magnetic field that quenches TWI
and produces a magnetized shock. The new field efficiently confines CRs and
enhances the acceleration efficiency. The CRs modify the shocks in GRB
afterglows at least while they remain relativistic. The origin of the magnetic
field that gives rise to the synchrotron emission is plausibly in the CR-driven
turbulence. We do not expect ultrahigh energy cosmic ray production in external

double-Keplerian model as a function of the poorly constrained eccentricity and
argument of periapse of the outer planet's orbit. The fit with the minimum
chi_{nu}^2 is dynamically unstable if the orbits are assumed to be coplanar.
However, the minimum is relatively shallow, and there is a wide range of fits
outside the minimum with reasonable chi_{nu}^2. For an assumed coplanar
inclination i = 30 deg. (sin i = 0.5), only good fits with both of the lowest
order, eccentricity-type mean-motion resonance variables at the 2:1
commensurability, theta_1 and theta_2, librating about 0 deg. are stable. For
sin i = 1, there are also some good fits with only theta_1 (involving the inner
planet's periapse longitude) librating that are stable for at least 10^8 years.
The libration semiamplitudes are about 6 deg. for theta_1 and 10 deg. for
theta_2 for the stable good fit with the smallest libration amplitudes of both
theta_1 and theta_2. We do not find any good fits that are non-resonant and

accretion disc components in the X-ray spectra of the most luminous (L ~ 10^40
erg/s) ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby normal galaxies. When
compared to stellar-mass black holes, the low disc temperatures observed in
some ULXs may imply intermediate-mass black hole primaries. Recent work has
claimed that such soft excesses are unlikely to be actual disc components,
based on the lack of variability in these components, and in the overall source
flux. Other work has proposed that alternative phenomenological models, and
complex Comptonisation models, rule-out cool disc components in ULX spectra. An
inspection of the literature on Galactic stellar-mass black holes and black
hole candidates demonstrates that the flux behaviours seen in specific ULXs are
consistent with phenomena observed in well-known Galactic X-ray binaries.
Applying Comptonisation models to simulated disc blackbody plus power-law
spectra shows that at the sensitivity achieved in even the best ULX spectra,
Comptonisation fits are highly model-dependent, and do not yield meaningful
constraints on the accretion flow. In contrast, the need for a soft, thermal
component does not appear to be model-dependent. As we have previously noted,
soft thermal components in ULX spectra may not represent accretion discs, but
present alternatives to this interpretation are not robust.

flares in the context of late internal shock and late external shock models. We
find that the X-ray flares in GRB 050421 and GRB 050502B originate from late

arise from late external shocks. Under the assumption that the central engine
has two periods of activities, we get four basic types of X-ray light curves.
The classification of these types depends on which period of activities
produces the prompt gamma-ray emission (Type 1 and Type 2: the earlier period;
Type 3 and Type 4: the late period), and on whether the late ejecta catching up
with the early ejecta happens earlier than the deceleration of the early ejecta
(Type 1 and Type 3) or not (Type 2 and Type 4). We find that the X-ray flare
caused by a late external shock is a special case of Type 1. Our analysis
reveals that the X-ray light curves of GRBs 050406, 050421, and 050607 can be
classified as Type 1, while the X-ray light curve of GRB 050502B is classified
as Type 2. However, the X-ray light curve of GRB 050406 is also likely to be
Type 2. We also predict a long-lag short-lived X-ray flare caused by the inner
external shock, which forms when a low baryon-loading long-lag late ejecta
decelerates in the non-relativistic tail of an outer external shock driven by
an early ejecta.

obtained using the photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) method. Kinetic
energy distribution and abundances for each ionic fragment have been obtained

in two nearby Herbig stars.
  Methods. We present high-resolution (R = 80,000) VLT/UVES echelle spectra of
the [O I] 6300A line in the Herbig Ae/Be stars HD 97048 and HD 100546. Apart
from the spectral signature, also the spatial extent of the [O I] emission
region is investigated. For both stars, we have obtained spectra with the slit
positioned at different position angles on the sky.
  Results. The [O I] emission region of HD 100546 appears to be coinciding with
the dust disk, its major axis located at 150+/-11 degrees east of north. The SE
part of the disk moves towards the observer, while the NW side is redshifted.
The [O I] emission region rotates counterclockwise around the central star. For
HD 97048, the position angle of the emission region is 160+/-19 degrees east of
north, which is the first determination of this angle in the literature. The
southern parts of the disk are blueshifted, the northern side moves away from
us. Our data support the idea that a gap is present at 10AU in the disk of HD
100546. Such a gap is likely planet-induced. We estimate the mass and orbital
radius of this hypothetical companion responsible for this gap to be 20 Jupiter
masses and 6.5 AU respectively.
  Conclusions. Based on temporal changes in the [O I] line profile, we conclude
that inhomogeneities are present in the [O I] emission region of HD 100546.
These ``clumps'' could be in resonance with the suggested companion, orbiting
the central star in about 11 yr. If confirmed, these observations could point
to the existence of an object straddling the line between giant planet and
brown dwarf in a system as young as 10 million years.

results are: 1. Most of the CO emission comes from the radial range R=3-16 kpc,
but peaks near R=10 kpc. The emission is con- centrated in narrow, arm-like
filaments defining two spiral arms with pitch angles of 7d-8d. The average
arm-interarm brightness ratio along the western arms reaches 20 compared to 4
for HI. 2. For a constant conversion factor Xco, the molecular fraction of the
neutral gas is enhanced in the arms and decreases radially. The apparent
gas-to-dust ratios N(HI)/I175 and (N(HI)+2N(H2))/I175 increase by a factor of
20 between the centre and R=14 kpc, whereas the ratio 2N(H2)/I175 only

conductance shows up when the molecule is strongly coupled to the thermal
baths, even in the absence of internal molecular nonlinearities. In contrast,
diode like behavior is expected for a highly anharmonic molecule with an
inherent structural asymmetry. Anharmonic interactions are also necessary for
manifesting Fourier type transport. We briefly present an extension of our

compressibility-incompressibility transitions in terms of sum rules for the
charge response. The modeling is substantiated by corresponding phonon
calculations. Extending investigations of the full dispersion and in particular
of the strongly doping dependent anomalous phonon modes in LaCuO, which so far
underpin our treatment of the density response of the electrons in the p-doped

compares well with recent experimental data and predicts the dispersion for the

compared for the insulating, underdoped, optimally doped and overdoped state of
LaCuO. From our modeling of the normal state a consistent picture of the
superconducting phase also can be extracted qualitatively pointing in the
underdoped regime to a phase ordering transition. On the other hand, the
modeling of the optimal and overdoped state is consistent with a quasi-particle
picture with a well defined Fermi surface. Thus, in the latter case a Fermi
surface instability with an evolution of pairs of well defined quasiparticles
is possible and can lead to a BCS-type ordering. So, it is tempting to
speculate that optimal $T_C$ in the HTSC's marks a crossover region between

normalized) hedgehog line density behaves like an order parameter: the density
is almost independent of the temperature in the confinement phase and changes
substantially as the system enters the deconfinement phase. In particular, our
results suggest that the (static) hedgehog lines may be relevant degrees of

The dynamics is studied here for the symmetry broken lambda(Phi^2)^2 scalar N
component field theory in the large N limit. We find a dynamical effective
potential for the expectation value that helps to understand the dynamics. The
dynamics presents two regimes defined by the presence or absence of a temporal
trapping close to the metastable equilibrium position of the potential. The two
regimes are separated by a critical value of the external field that depends on
the initial temperature. The temporal trapping is shorter for larger initial
temperatures or larger external fields. Parametric resonances and spinodal
instabilities amplify the quantum fluctuations in the field components
transverse to the external field. When there is a temporal trapping this is the
main mechanism that allows the system to escape from the metastable state for
large N. Subsequently backreaction stops the growth of the quantum fluctuations
and the system enters a quasiperiodic regime.

$\nu_{Di}$ and the light Majorana neutrino mass eigenstates $\nu_{i}$, where
$U_{bimaximal}$ is the bimaximal mixing matrix. By these two ansatz, the

demonstration of non vanishing neutrino masses and flavour mixing. The ultimate
goal is the understanding of the origin of these properties from new physics.
In this road, the last unknown mixing $[U_{e3}]$ must be determined. If it is
proved to be non-zero, the possibility is open for Charge Conjugation-Parity
(CP) violation in the lepton sector. This will require precision experiments
with a very intense neutrino source. Here a novel method to create a
monochromatic neutrino beam, an old dream for neutrino physics, is proposed
based on the recent discovery of nuclei that decay fast through electron
capture. Such nuclei will generate a monochromatic directional neutrino beam
when decaying at high energy in a storage ring with long straight sections. We
also show that the capacity of such a facility to discover new physics is
impressive, so that fine tuning of the boosted neutrino energy allows precision
measurements of the oscillation parameters even for a $[U_{e3}]$ mixing as

completely independent of the hamiltonian approach. To this end on the sphere
topology we solve the Riemann-Hilbert problem for three singularities of finite
strength and a fourth one infinitesimal, by determining perturbatively the
Poincare' accessory parameters. This provides the semiclassical four point
vertex function with three finite charges and a fourth infinitesimal. Some of
the results are extended to the case of n finite charges and m infinitesimal.
With the same technique we compute the exact Green function on the sphere on
the background of three finite singularities. Turning to the full quantum
problem we address the calculation of the quantum determinant on the background
of three finite charges and of the further perturbative corrections. The zeta
function regularization provides a theory which is not invariant under local
conformal transformations. Instead by employing a regularization suggested in
the case of the pseudosphere by Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov we obtain the
correct quantum conformal dimensions from the one loop calculation and we show
explicitly that the two loop corrections do not change such dimensions. We then
apply the method to the case of the pseudosphere with one finite singularity
and compute the exact value for the quantum determinant. Such results are
compared to those of the conformal bootstrap approach finding complete
agreement.

quantum field theories from string theory. In a first part we study the
generation of a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, coupled to an adjoint chiral
superfield, from type IIB string theory on non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds,
with D-branes wrapping certain subcycles. The low energy limit of this
non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained from a second non-compact Calabi-Yau
geometry, which is related to the first one through a geometric transition. In
particular, the effective superpotential governing the vacuum structure of the
gauge theory can be obtained from integrals on a Calabi-Yau manifold. These
integrals in turn are related to matrix model quantities and one therefore can
use the matrix model to learn something about the gauge theory vacua. The
second part of this work covers the generation of four-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theories, carrying several important characteristic
features of the standard model, from compactifications of eleven-dimensional
supergravity on G_2-manifolds. We discuss anomaly cancellation through inflow
in the case of conical singularities, present an explicit compact manifold with
two conical singularities and weak G_2-holonomy, and review the anomaly
cancellation mechanism in the context of M-theory on the interval.

source at z=0 a distance d<L in front of an L wide lossless double negative
(DNG) slab with permittivity and permeability equal to -1, the single-frequency
solution exhibits not only ""perfectly focused"" fields for z>2L but also
divergent infinite fields in the region 2d<z<2L. In contrast, the solution to
the same lossless -1 DNG slab illuminated by a sinusoidal wave that begins at
some initial time t =0 (and thus has a nonzero bandwidth, unlike the
single-frequency excitation that begins at t=-infinity) is proven to have
imperfectly focused fields and convergent finite fields everywhere for all
finite time t. The proof hinges on the variation of permittivity and
permeability having a lower bound imposed by causality and energy conservation.
The minimum time found to produce a given resolution is proportional to the
estimate obtained by [Gomez-Santos, Phys. Rev. Lett., 90, 077401 (2003)]. Only
as t approaches infinity do the fields become perfectly focused in the region
z>2L and divergent in the region 2d<z<2L. These theoretical results, which are
confirmed by numerical examples, imply that divergent fields of the
single-frequency solution are not caused by an inherent inconsistency in
assuming an ideal lossless -1 DNG material, but are the result of the
continuous single-frequency wave (which contains infinite energy) building up
infinite reactive fields during the infinite duration of time from t=-infinity

  scales","55 pages, 53 figures. Submitted. Higher resolution figures are
  available at http://www.acm.caltech.edu/~owhadi/",,,,"math.AP math.NA math.PR",,"  This paper addresses the issue of homogenization of linear divergence form
parabolic operators in situations where no ergodicity and no scale separation
in time or space are available. Namely, we consider divergence form linear
parabolic operators in $\Omega \subset \R^n$ with $L^\infty(\Omega \times
(0,T))$-coefficients. It appears that the inverse operator maps the unit ball
of $L^2(\Omega\times (0,T))$ into a space of functions which at small (time and
space) scales are close in $H^1$-norm to a functional space of dimension $n$.
It follows that once one has solved these equations at least $n$-times it is
possible to homogenize them both in space and in time, reducing the number of
operations counts necessary to obtain further solutions. In practice we show
that under a Cordes type condition that the first order time derivatives and
second order space derivatives of the solution of these operators with respect
to harmonic coordinates are in $L^2$ (instead of $H^{-1}$ with Euclidean
coordinates). If the medium is time independent then it is sufficient to solve
$n$ times the associated elliptic equation in order to homogenize the parabolic
equation.

various media, from galactic geometry to cardiac tissue. In the literature,
very specific models are used to explain some of the observed incarnations of
these dynamic entities. Barkley first noticed that the range of possible spiral
behaviour is caused by the Euclidean symmetry that these models possess.
  In experiments however, the physical domain is never perfectly Euclidean. The
heart, for instance, is finite, anisotropic and littered with inhomogeneities.
To capture this loss of symmetry and as a result model the physical situation
with a higher degree of accuracy, LeBlanc and Wulff introduced forced Euclidean
symmetry-breaking (FESB) in the analysis, via two basic types of perturbations:
translational symmetry-breaking (TSB) and rotational symmetry-breaking terms.
They show that phenomena such as anchoring and quasi-periodic meandering can be
explained by combining Barkley's insight with FESB.

studying the effects of n simultaneous TSB perturbations, where n > 1.

small constant times $V^{2/3}(log V)^{-4/3}$, where V is the volume of the

subjected to arithmetic algorithms until grade 6. In earlier grades they read,
invented, and discussed stories and problems; estimated lengths, heights, and
areas; and enjoyed finding and interpreting numbers relevant to their lives. In
grade 6, with 4 months of formal training, they caught up to the regular
students in algorithmic ability, and were far ahead in general numeracy and in
the verbal, semantic, and problem solving skills they had practiced for the
five years before. Assessment was both qualitative -- e.g., asking 8th grade
students to relate in their own words why it is `that if you have two fractions
with the same numerator, the one with the smaller denominator is the larger';

this choice is that, in competitive markets, a greater quantity of the good is

Electricity markets are pretty different from other commodities mainly due to
the physical constraints related to the network structure that may impact the
market performance. The network structure of the system on which the economic
transactions need to be undertaken poses strict physical and operational
constraints. Strategic interactions among producers that game the market with
the objective of maximizing their producer surplus must be taken into account
when modeling competitive electricity markets. The physical constraints,
specific of the electricity markets, provide additional opportunity of gaming
to the market players. Game theory provides a tool to model such a context.
This paper discussed the application of game theory to physical constrained
electricity markets with the goal of providing tools for assessing the market
performance and pinpointing the critical network constraints that may impact
the market efficiency. The basic models of game theory specifically designed to
represent the electricity markets will be presented. IEEE30 bus test system of

insuring the consistency of the histories, is called the nondemolition, or
causality principle in modern quantum theory. The application of this rule in

replacing the real space with complex space and additionally imposing the

where the information is encoded into massive indistinguishable particles:
bosons or fermions. We study the situation in which the particles are
noninteracting. The encoding input states obey a set of physically motivated
constraints on the mean values of the energy and particle number. In such a
case, the determination of both classical and quantum capacity reduces to a
constrained maximization of entropy. In the case of noninteracting bosons,
signatures of Bose Einstein condensation can be observed in the behavior of the
capacity. A major motivation for these considerations is to compare the
information carrying capacities of channels that carry bosons with those that
carry fermions. We show analytically that fermions generally provide higher
channel capacity, i.e., they are better suited for transferring bits as well as
qubits, in comparison to bosons. This holds for a large range of power law
potentials, and for moderate to high temperatures. Numerical simulations seem
to indicate that the result holds for all temperatures. Also, we consider the
low temperature behavior for the three-dimensional box and harmonic trap, and
again we show that the fermionic capacity is higher than the bosonic one for
sufficiently low temperatures.

  nonlocality test","New Journal of Physics 8 302 (2006)","10.1088/1367-2630/8/12/302",,"quant-ph",,"  Bell theorems show how to experimentally falsify local realism. Conclusive
falsification is highly desirable as it would provide support for the most
profoundly counterintuitive feature of quantum theory - nonlocality. Despite
the preponderance of evidence for quantum mechanics, practical limits on
detector efficiency and the difficulty of coordinating space-like separated
measurements have provided loopholes for a classical worldview; these loopholes
have never been simultaneously closed. A number of new experiments have
recently been proposed to close both loopholes at once. We show some of these
novel designs fail in the most basic way, by not ruling out local hidden
variable models, and we provide an explicit classical model to demonstrate
this. They share a common flaw, which reveals a basic misunderstanding of how
nonlocality proofs work. Given the time and resources now being devoted to such
experiments, theoretical clarity is essential. Our explanation is presented in
terms of simple logic and should serve to correct misconceptions and avoid
future mistakes. We also show a nonlocality proof involving four participants
which has interesting theoretical properties.
