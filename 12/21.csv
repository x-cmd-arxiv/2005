the goal of investigating the interplay between numerical resolution effects

At the highest achieved resolution, we resolve the virial region of a
Virgo-like cluster with more than 2 million gas particles and with at least as
many dark-matter (DM) particles. Our resolution study confirms that, in the
absence of an efficient feedback mechanism, runaway cooling leads to about 35
per cent of baryons in clusters to be locked up in long lived stars at our
highest resolution, with no evidence of convergence. However, including
feedback causes the fraction of cooled baryons to converge at about 15 per cent
already at modest resolution. Feedback also stabilizes other gas-related
quantities, such as radial profiles of entropy, gas density and temperature,
against variations due to changes in resolution. We also investigate the
influence of the gravitational force softening length, and that of numerical
heating of the gas induced by two-body encounters between DM and lighter gas
particles. We show that simulations where more DM than gas particles are used,
show a significantly enhanced efficiency of star formation at z>3. Our results
are important for establishing and delineating the regime of numerical
reliability of the present generation of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy
clusters.

accelerators, and suggest that there is a population of Galactic gamma-ray
sources with emission extending beyond 10 TeV. A dedicated system of Cherenkov
imaging telescopes optimised for higher energies appears to be a promising way

offers a significant improvement over conventional techniques due to enhanced
reduction of atmospheric image motion. The method is based on two key elements:
apodization of the entrance pupil and the enhanced virtual symmetry of
reference stars. Symmetrization is implemented by setting special weights to
each reference star. Thus a reference field itself forms a virtual net filter
that effectively attenuates the image motion spectrum. Atmospheric positional
error was found to follow a power dependency ~ R^{K \mu /2} D^{-K/2+1/3} on
angular field size R and aperture D; here K is some optional even integer
2<=K<=sqrt{8N+1}-1 limited by a number N of reference stars, and \mu <= 1 is a
term dependent on K and the magnitude and sky star distribution in the field.
As compared to conventional techniques for which K=2, the improvement in
accuracy increases by some orders. Limitations to astrometric performance of
monopupil large ground-based telescopes are estimated. The total atmospheric
and photon noise for at a 10 m telescope at good 0.4"" seeing was found to be,
depending on sky star density, 10 to 60 microarcsec per 10 min exposure in R
band. For a 100 m telescope and FWHM=0.1"" (low-order adaptive optics
corrections) the potential accuracy is 0.2 to 2 microarcsec.

impact on the observable surface temperature. Extending the approach initiated
in Geppert et al.(2004), we consider more complex and, hence, more realistic,
magnetic field structures but still restrict ourselves to axisymmetric
configurations. We put special emphasis on the heat blanketing effect of a
toroidal field component. We show that asymmetric temperature distributions can
occur and a crustal field consisting of dipolar poloidal and toroidal
components will cause one polar spot to be larger than the opposing one. These
two warm regions can be separated by an extended cold equatorial belt. We
present an internal magnetic field structure which can explain both the X-ray
and optical spectra of the isolated NS RXJ 1856-3754. We investigate the
effects of the resulting surface temperature profiles on the observable
lightcurve which an isolated thermally emitting NS would produce for different
field geometries. The lightcurves will be both qualitatively (deviations from
sinusoidal shape) and quantitatively (larger pulsed fraction for the same
observational geometry) different from those of a NS with an isothermal crust.
This opens the possibility to determine the interna} magnetic field strengths
and structures in NSs by modeling their X-ray lightcurves and spectra. The
striking similarities of our model calculations with the observed spectra and
pulse profiles of isolated thermally emitting NSs is an indication for the
existence of strong magnetic field components maintained by crustal currents.

which allows us to precisely determine the binary orbital period
(Porb=9.87+/-0.03hr) and the white dwarf spin period Pspin=693.01+/-0.06s).
This system is then the third just outside the purported 6-10hr IP orbital
period gap and the fifth of the small group of long period IPs, which has a
relatively high degree of asynchronism. From the presence of weak red
absorption features, we identify the secondary star with a spectral type
K2+/-2V, which appears to have evolved on the nuclear timescale. From the
orbital radial velocities of emission and the red absorption lines a mass ratio
q=0.65+/-0.12 is found. The masses of the components are estimated to be Mwd >=
0.5Msun and Msec=0.4-0.79Msun and the binary inclination 25deg < i <=58deg . A
distance between 540-840pc is estimated. At this distance, the presence of
peculiar absorption features surrounding Balmer emissions cannot be due to the
contribution of the white dwarf photosphere and their spin modulation suggests
an origin in the magnetically confined accretion flow. The white dwarf is also
not accreting at a particularly high rate (Mdot<5x10**16g/s), for its orbital
period. The spin-to-orbit period ratio Pspin/Porb=0.02 and the low mass
accretion rate suggest that this system is far from spin equilibrium. The
magnetic moment of the accreting white dwarf is found to be < 4.1x10**32

  By constructing effective actions in terms of suitable order parameters, we
revisit this outstanding open problem.
  We find that if the instability is driven by the SF Goldstone mode near $ k=0
$, then there is a quantum Lifshitz transition from the SF to a Boosted SF
(BSF) with the dynamic exponent $ (z_x=3/2,z_y=3) $ subject to logarithmic
corrections from a marginally irrelevant cubic term.
  This case may happen to exciton superfluids in bilayer quantum Hall systems
or electron-hole bilayer systems, especially in weakly interacting Bose gas in
cold atom systems.
  If the instability is driven by the roton mode near a finite momentum $ k=k_0
$, then there is a SF to a stripe supersolid transition with the dynamic
exponent $ z=1 $ which is in the same universality class as the $ z=1 $ boosted
Mott-SF transition studied previously in a different context. This case may
apply to Helium 4 and also cold atom BECs where the rotons in the SF phase
plays an important role.
  Driving a SF sufficiently fast may become an effective way to create a SS

slowly varying over the size of the Cooper pairs. The equations reduce to a
generalized time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation on the BEC side of the

(F) and antiferromagnetism (AF) in the pure itinerant model. These methods can
be extended later to the superconducting materials. In our model we assume the
extended Hubbard Hamiltonian. Transition from the paramagnetic state to the
ordered state of magnetic nature is decided by the competition between kinetic
and potential energy in which there is an increase in the kinetic energy
moderated by the inter-site interactions, and a decrease in the potential
energy. The competition between these two energies results in the existence of
critical values of interactions for creating magnetic alignment. Only when
existing in a given material interaction exceeds the critical value for a given
type of ordering we can have the alignment of this type.
  The influence of inter-site correlation on F and AF in the presence of
Coulomb on-site correlation is investigated. The well known Landau free energy
expansion is corrected for both F and AF ordering to reflect the presence of
critical interaction in the second order term, which leads to the magnetic
alignment.
  The numerical results show that the inter-site interactions favor F at the
end of the band and AF at the half-filled point. In both cases of F and AF
ordering, these interactions lower substantially the Curie and Neel's
temperature towards experimental data. This helps to remove the paradox in
magnetism that has persisted for a long time.

diluted magnetic materials, taking as a model for the exchange between magnetic
impurities a damped Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction and a shor
t range term representing the effects of superexchange. To properly include
effects of spin and thermal fluctuations as well as geometric disorder, we
solve the effective Heisenberg Hamiltonian by means of a recently developed
semi-analytical approach. This approach, ``self-consistent local Random Phase
Approximation (SC-L RPA)'', is explained. We show that previous mean-field
treatments, which have been widely used in the literature, largely overestimate
both the Curie temperatures and the stability of ferromagnetism as a function
of carrier density. The discr epancy when compared to the current approach was
that effects of frustration in RKKY oscillations had been strongly
underestimated by such simple mea n-field theories. We argue that the use, as
is frequent, of a weakly-disordered RKKY exchange to model ferromagnetism in
diluted III-V systems is inconsistent with the observation of ferromagnetism
over a wide region of itinerant carrier densities. This may be puzzling when
compared to the apparent success of calculations based on {\it ab-initio}
estimates of the coupling; we propose a resolution to this issue by taking
RKKY-like interactions between resonant states close to the Fermi level.

dimensions (2D). We demonstrate how the electronic structure of poly-MTO can be
tailored by intercalation of organic donor molecules, such as
tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) or bis-(ethylendithio)-tetrathiafulvalene (BEDT-TTF),
and by the inorganic acceptor SbF$_3$. Integration of donor molecules leads to
a more insulating behavior of poly-MTO, whereas SbF$_3$ insertion does not
cause any significant change in the resistivity. The resistivity data of pure
poly-MTO is remarkably well described by a two-dimensional electron system.
Below 38 K an unusual resistivity behavior, similar to that found in doped
cuprates, is observed: The resistivity initially increases approximately as
$\rho \sim$ ln$(1/T$) before it changes into a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence below 2 K.
As an explanation we suggest a crossover from purely two-dimensional
charge-carrier diffusion within the \{ReO$_2$\}$_{\infty}$ planes at high
temperatures to three-dimensional diffusion at low temperatures in a
disorder-enhanced electron-electron interaction scenario (Altshuler-Aronov
correction). Furthermore, a linear positive magnetoresistance was found in the
insulating regime, which is caused by spatial localization of itinerant
electrons at some of the Re atoms, which formally adopt a $5d^1$ electronic
configuration. X-ray diffraction, IR- and ESR-studies, temperature dependent
magnetization and specific heat measurements in various magnetic fields suggest
that the electronic structure of poly-MTO can safely be approximated by a
purely 2D conductor.

experimental observations of transport properties, under conditions in which
the thermal energy is comparable to the spacing between the single-particle
levels. For this purpose we have devised a many-body approach to the
one-dimensional electron system, incorporating the effects of a discrete
spectrum. We show that, in the crossover regime, the tunneling conductance
follows a power-law behavior as a function of the temperature, with an exponent
that oscillates with the gate voltage as observed in the experiments. Also in
agreement with the experimental observations, a distinctive feature of our
approach is the existence of an inflection point in the log-log plots of the
conductance vs temperature, at gate voltages corresponding to peaks in the
oscillation of the exponent. Moreover, we evaluate the effects of a transverse
magnetic field on the transport properties of the multi-walled nanotubes. For
fields of the order of 4 T, we find changes in the band structure that may be
already significant for the outer shells, leading to an appreciable variation
in the power-law behavior of the conductance. We then foresee the appearance of
sensible modulations in the exponent of the conductance for higher magnetic
fields, as the different subbands are shifted towards the development of flat
Landau levels.

sired outcome. In the last few years this field has received much interest of
researchers in computer science, especially with the Internet developing as a
platform for communications and connections among enormous numbers of computers
and humans. Arguably the most positive result in mechanism de- sign is truthful
and there are only one general truthful mechanisms so far : the generalized
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. But VCG mecha- nism has one shortage:
The implementation of truthfulness is on the cost of decreasing the revenue of
the mechanism. (e.g., Ning Chen and Hong Zhu. [1999]). We introduce three new
characters of mechanism:partly truthful, criti- cal, consistent, and introduce
a new mechanism: X mechanism that satisfy the above three characters. Like VCG
mechanism, X mechanism also generalizes from Vickery Auction and is consistent
with Vickery auction in many ways, but the extended methods used in X mechanism
is different from that in VCG mechanism . This paper will demonstrate that X
mechanism better than VCG mechanism in optimizing utility of mechanism, which
is the original intention of mechanism design. So partly truthful,critical and
consistent are at least as important as truthful in mechanism design, and they
beyond truthful in many situations.As a result, we conclude that partly
truthful,critical and consistent are three new directions in mechanism design.

based on a generalization from flat spacetime to curved spacetime of the
extended-body approach of Ori and Rosenthal. In this approach the charged
particle is first modeled as a body of finite extension s, the net force acting
on the extended body is computed, and the limit s -> 0 is taken at the end of
the calculation. Concretely our extended body is a dumbbell that consists of
two point charges that are maintained at a constant spacelike separation s. The
net force acting on the dumbbell includes contributions from the mutual forces
exerted on each charge by the field created by the other charge, the individual
self-forces exerted on each charge by its own field, and the external force
which is mostly responsible for the dumbbell's acceleration. These
contributions are added up, in a way that respects the curved nature of the
spacetime, and all diverging terms in the net force are shown to be removable
by mass renormalization. Our end result, in the limit s -> 0, is the standard
expression for the electromagnetic self-force in curved spacetime.

consequences: first total lepton number is not conserved, and second, the
neutrino is a Majorana particle. Further the effective mass measured allows to
put an absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. In addition, double beta
experiments yield sharp restrictions also for other beyond standard model
physics. These include SUSY models, leptoquarks (leptoquark-Higgs
coupling),compositeness, left-right symmetric models (right-handed W boson
mass), test of special relativity and of the equivalence principle in the
neutrino sector and others. First evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay
was given in 2001, by the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment. The HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW
experiment is the by far most sensitive 0-nu-bb experiment since more than 10
years. It operated 11 kg of enriched 76Ge in the Gran Sasso. The collected
statistics in the period 1990 - 2003 is 71.7 kgy. The background achieved in
the energy region of the Q value for double beta decay is 0.11events/kgykeV.
The two-neutrino accompanied half-life is determined on the basis of more than
100000 events to be (1.74. {+0.18}{-0.16})x10^{21}years. The confidence level
for the neutrinoless signal is 4.2 sigma level (more than 5 sigma in the
pulse-shape-selected spectrum). The half-life is T_{1/2}^{0\nu}=(1.19{+0.37}
{-0.23})x10^{25}years. The effective neutrino mass deduced is (0.2-0.6)eV
(99.73% c.l.), i.e. neutrinos have degenerate masses, and consequently can
considerably contribute to hot dark matter in the Universe. The sharp
boundaries for other beyond SM physics, mentioned above, are comfortably
competitive to corresponding results from high-energy accelerators like

suppression of this semi-heavy quark yield by its quark mass. In addition, the
dynamical expansion of colored quanta pushes against the vacuum structure, with
a resulting supercooling of the transition temperature. We address the status
of the search for the phase boundary as function of reaction energy and
collision centrality and show evidence for a change in reaction mechanism at
sufficiently low energies. The phase diagram derived from the study of hadron
production conditions shows two boundaries, one corresponding to the expected
transition between confined and deconfined matter, with a downward temperature
shift, and the other a high quark density hadronization which appears to
involve heavy effective quarks, at relatively large temperatures.

which hadronic configurations -- $D/D^* + \pi, D/D^* + 2 \pi, ...$ -- make up
$\Gamma (\bar B \to l \bar \nu X_c)$ beyond $\bar B \to l \bar \nu D/D^*$, what

relevant for the determination of hadronic mass moments in $\bar B \to l \bar

want to explain the theoretical issues involved, why they carry `gravitas' --
i.e. are weighty -- and why a better understanding of them will be of
significant value. In this brief memo we sketch the underlying arguments based
on heavy quark theory, the OPE, a special class of quark models and lattice QCD
in a nutshell. After summarizing the experimental situation we conclude with
two lists, namely one with measurements that need to be done and one with items

invariant, instead of just quasi-invariant,
  (ii) to have a well defined action principle, so that the action is an

obtained using hamiltonian methods,
  (iv) to regularize the action so that the euclidean action is finite and the
black hole thermodynamics derived from this action agrees with the one obtained
by hamiltonian methods.

potential, that probe the degrees of freedom of the QCD string, are critically
reviewed. It is emphasized that comparison of experimental or SU(N_c) lattice
data, at finite number of colors N_c, with free string theory can be misleading
due to string interactions. Large-N_c extrapolation of pure lattice gauge
theory data, in both 3 and 4 dimensions, indicates that there are more
worldsheet degrees of freedom than the purely massless transverse ones of the
free Nambu-Goto string. The extra variables are consistent with massive modes
of oscillation that effectively contribute like c ~ 1/2 conformal degrees of
freedom to highly excited states. As a concrete example, the highly excited
spectrum of the Chodos-Thorn relativistic string in 1+1 dimensions is analyzed,
where there are no transverse oscillations. It is found that the asymptotic
density of states for this model is characteristic of a c=1/2 conformal

investigate non-perturbative decay processes involving ghosts, such as the
spontaneous creation of self-gravitating lumps of ghost matter, as well as
pairs of Bondi dipoles (i.e., lumps of ghost matter chasing after positive

Euclidean action. In some cases, the instantons induce topology change or have
negative Euclidean action. To shed some light on the meaning of such

the canonical (Lorentzian) description of tunneling. We conclude that
non-perturbative ghost nucleation processes can be safely suppressed in

rational curves on algebraic varieties. It was written for the survey volume of

  To start, we discuss existence results for rational curves on foliated
manifolds. We construct the tangent morphism, define the variety of minimal
rational tangents (VMRT) and name a number of results that show that many of
the geometry properies of a uniruled variety are encoded in the projective
geometry of the VMRT.
  The results are then applied in two different settings. For one, we discuss
the geometry of chains of rational curves on uniruled varieties, show how the
length of a variety can be determined from the VMRT and discuss the concrete
example of the moduli space of vector bundles on a curve.
  On the other hand, the existence results for rational curves can be also be
used to study manifolds which are known NOT to contain rational curves. We
employ this method to study deformations of morphisms. Finally, we look at
families of varieties of canonically polarized manifolds over complex surfaces,
and use non-existence results for rational curves on the base to relate the
variation of the family with the logarithmic Kodaira dimension of the base.

two orbits within each pair differ only by their connections inside close
self-encounters in phase space. The frequency of occurrence of these
self-encounters is determined by ergodicity. Permutation theory is used to
systematically sum over all topologically different families of such orbit
pairs. The resulting expansions of the form factor in powers of $\tau$ coincide
with the predictions of random-matrix theory, both for systems with and without
time-reversal invariance, and to all orders in $\tau$. Our results are closely
related to the zero-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ model of quantum field

$0.6<x_F<1.2$, which we refer to as the trans-fragmentation region (TFR), since
it corresponds roughly to $\eta'>0$, where $\eta'=\eta-y_{\rm beam}$, depending
on $p_T$. We show how hadrons can be produced in that region when the
hadronization process is parton recombination. The inclusive $x$-distributions
for proton and pion production are calculated with momentum degradation taken
into account. The results show that the proton yield is significantly higher
than that of the pions in the TFR. Without particle identification the existing
data cannot be used for comparison with our result on the $p/\pi$ ratio.
Without $p_T$ determination it is not feasible to relate the $x$ distribution
to the experimental $\eta'$ distribution. Nevertheless, on theoretical grounds
we have shown why the production of hadrons in the TFR is not forbidden by
momentum conservation.

automata, introduced by Nowak and May \cite{nm92}, in which the pressure of the
environment is taken into account. This is implemented by requiring that
individuals need to collect a minimum score $U_{min}$, representing
indispensable resources (nutrients, energy, money, etc.) to prosper in this
environment. So the agents, instead of evolving just by adopting the behaviour
of the most successful neighbour (who got $U^{msn}$), also take into account if
$U^{msn}$ is above or below the threshold $U_{min}$. If $U^{msn}<U_{min}$ an
individual has a probability of adopting the opposite behaviour from the one
used by its most successful neighbour. This modification allows the evolution
of cooperation for payoffs for which defection was the rule (as it happens, for
example, when the sucker's payoff is much worse than the punishment for mutual
defection). We also analyse a more sophisticated version of this model in which
the selective rule is supplemented with a ""win-stay, lose-shift"" criterion. The
cluster structure is analyzed and, for this more complex version we found
power-law scaling for a restricted region in the parameter space.

the deterministic case where at most $L_d$ messages can be transmitted with
perfect fidelity, and in the unambiguous case where when the protocol succeeds
(probability $\tau_x$) Bob knows for sure that Alice sent message $x$, and when
it fails (probability $1-\tau_x$) he knows it has failed. Alice is allowed any
single-shot (one use) encoding procedure, and Bob any single-shot measurement.
For $\bar D\leq D$ a bound is obtained for $L_d$ in terms of the largest
Schmidt coefficient of the entangled state, and is compared with published
results by Mozes et al. For $\bar D > D$ it is shown that $L_d$ is strictly
less than $D^2$ unless $\bar D$ is an integer multiple of $D$, in which case
uniform (maximal) entanglement is not needed to achieve the optimal protocol.
The unambiguous case is studied for $\bar D \leq D$, assuming $\tau_x>0$ for a
set of $\bar D D$ messages, and a bound is obtained for the average
$\lgl1/\tau\rgl$. A bound on the average $\lgl\tau\rgl$ requires an additional
assumption of encoding by isometries (unitaries when $\bar D=D$) that are
orthogonal for different messages. Both bounds are saturated when $\tau_x$ is a
constant independent of $x$, by a protocol based on one-shot entanglement
concentration. For $\bar D > D$ it is shown that (at least) $D^2$ messages can
be sent unambiguously. Whether unitary (isometric) encoding suffices for
optimal protocols remains a major unanswered question, both for our work and
for previous studies of dense coding using partially-entangled states,
including noisy (mixed) states.

A 74, 052322 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.74.052322",,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, there has been growing interest in using adiabatic quantum
computation as an architecture for experimentally realizable quantum computers.
One of the reasons for this is the idea that the energy gap should provide some
inherent resistance to noise. It is now known that universal quantum
computation can be achieved adiabatically using 2-local Hamiltonians. The
energy gap in these Hamiltonians scales as an inverse polynomial in the problem
size. Here we present stabilizer codes which can be used to produce a constant
energy gap against 1-local and 2-local noise. The corresponding fault-tolerant
universal Hamiltonians are 4-local and 6-local respectively, which is the
optimal result achievable within this framework.

spin-1/2 particles or polarized photons. But they also have other important
properties, namely they are instable particles and they violate the CP symmetry
(C...charge conjugation, P...parity). We consider a Bell inequality and,
surprisingly, the premises of local realistic theories require strict CP
conservation, in contradiction to experiment. Furthermore we investigate Bohr's
complementary relation in order to describe the physics of the time evolution
of kaons. Finally, we discuss quantum marking and eraser experiments with
kaons, which prove in a new way the very concept of a quantum eraser.

  455.",,,"quant-ph",,"  After a brief introduction to the quantum no-cloning theorem and its link
with the linearity and causality of quantum mechanics, the concept of quantum
cloning machines is sketched, following, whenever possible, the chronology of
the main results. The important classes of quantum cloning machines are
reviewed, in particular state-independent and state-dependent cloning machines.
The 1-to-2 cloning problem is then studied from a formal point of view, using
the isomorphism between completely positive maps and operators, which leads to
the so-called double-Bell ansatz. This also yields an efficient numerical
approach to quantum cloning, based on semidefinite programming methods. The
derivation of the optimal N-to-M universal cloning machine in d dimensions is
then detailed, as well as the notion of asymmetric cloning machines. In the
second part of this review, the optical implementation of cloning machines is
considered. It is shown that the universal cloning of photons can be achieved
by parametric amplification of light or by symmetrization via the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. The various experimental demonstrations of quantum
cloning machines are reviewed. The cloning of orthogonally polarized photons is
also considered, as well as the asymmetric and phase-covariant cloning of
photons. Finally, the extension of quantum cloning to continuous variables is
analyzed. The optimal cloning of coherent states of light by phase-insensitive
amplification is explained, as well as the experimental realization of
continuous-variable quantum cloning with linear optics, measurement, and
feed-forward operations.

the systems past through a noisy environment. For the detection of noise we

efficient than a simple generalization of the purification protocol for a

community to the fact that in Bell's arguments one can not distinguish two
hypotheses: a) quantum mechanics is {\it nonlocal}, b) quantum mechanics is
{\it nonergodic.} Therefore experimental violations of Bell's inequality can be
as well interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that stochastic processes
induced by quantum measurements are nonergodic. The latter hypothesis was
discussed actively by Buonomano since 1980th. However, in contrast to Bell's
hypothesis on nonlocality it did not attract so much attention. The only
experiment testing the hypothesis on nonergodicity was performed in neutron
interferometry (by Summhammer, in 1989). This experiment can be considered as
rejecting this hypothesis. However, it cannot be considered as a decisive
experiment. New experiments are badly needed. We point out that a nonergodic
model can be realistic, i.e., the distribution of hidden (local!) variables is
well defined. We also discuss coupling of violation of the Bell inequality with
violation of the condition of weak mixing for ergodic dynamical systems.

must be satisfied by any separable two-mode states. These inequalities are
presented in terms of the su(2) operators J_x, J_y, and the total photon number
N_a+N_b. They include as special cases the inequality derived by Hillery and
Zubairy [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 050503 (2006)], and the one by Agarwal and Biswas

inequalities leads to the criterion obtained by Agarwal and Biswas. We show
that this optimal criterion can detect entanglement for a broad class of
non-Gaussian entangled states, i.e., the su(2) minimum-uncertainty states.
Experimental schemes to test the optimal criterion are also discussed,
especially the one using linear optical devices and photodetectors.

probe smaller and smaller regions of space. We then discuss the relationship
between the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation and our conditions for the
presence of entanglement and compare the respective critical temperatures. We
close with a short discussion of the idea of seeing entanglement as a
macroscopic property in thermodynamical systems and its possible relation to
phase transitions in general.

to irreversible process in isolated quantum systems. The use of the Hamiltonian
can induce the non-Markovian Langevin equation, showing a complex memory
