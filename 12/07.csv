  shortened","Astron.J.131:1806-1815,2006","10.1086/500298",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the first high-resolution (R ~ 31,000) spectra of the cool sdL
2MASS0532, and what was originally identified as an early-type L subdwarf (sdL)
LSR1610-0040. Our work, in combination with contemporaneous work by Cushing and
Vacca, makes it clear that the latter object is more probably a mid-M dwarf
with an unusual composition that gives it some sub-dwarf spectral features. We
use the data to derive precise radial velocities for both objects and to
estimate space motion; both are consistent with halo kinematics. We measure the
projected rotational velocities, revealing very slow rotation for the old sd?M6
object \lsr. \twom exhibits rapid rotation of vsini = 65 +- 15km/s, consistent
with the behavior of L dwarfs. This means that the braking time for L dwarfs is
extremely long, or that perhaps they never slow down. A detailed comparison of
the atomic Rb and Cs lines to spectra of field L dwarfs shows the spectral type
\twom is consistent with being mid- to late-L. The Rb I and K I lines of \lsr\
are like an early-L dwarf, but the Cs I line is like a mid-M dwarf. The
appearance of the Ca II triplet in absorption in this object is very hard to
understand if it is not as least as warm as M6. We explain these effects in a
consistent way using a mildly metal-poor mid-M model. M subdwarfs have weak
metal-oxides and enhanced metal-hydrides relative to normal M dwarfs. \lsr\
exhibits metal-hydrides like an M dwarf but metal-oxides like a subdwarf. The
same explanation that resolves the atomic line discrepancy explains this as
well. We identify atomic lines of Ti around 9600 \AA and a small contribution
of FeH, but we cannot confirm a detection of TiH in the spectra of cool L
subdwarfs. High resolution spectroscopy has aided in beginning to understand
the complex molecular chemistry in metal-deficient and ultralow-mass objects.

self-adjoint formalism introduced in Papaloizou \& Ivanov 2005 (PI) to derive
general expressions for the energy and angular momentum transfered when the
planet or a star passes through periastron in a parabolic or highly eccentric
orbit around a central mass, without making a low frequency approximation as
was done in PI. We show how these can be adapted to the low frequency limit in
which only inertial modes contribute to the energy and angular momentum
transfer. We calculate the inertial mode eigenspectrum for planet models of one
and five Jupiter masses $M_J,$ without a solid core, with different radii
corresponding to different ages.
  We consider the multi-passage problem when there is no dissipation finding
that stochastic instability resulting in the stochastic gain of inertial mode
energy over many periastron passages occurs under similar conditions to those
already found for the $f$ modes.
  We apply our calculations to the problem of the tidal circularisation of the
orbits of the extra solar planets in a state of pseudo synchronisation, and
find that inertial mode excitation dominates the tidal interaction for $1 M_J$
planets that start with semi- major axes less than $10 AU$ and end up on
circular orbits with final period in the $4-6$ day range. It is potentially
able to account for initial circularisation up to a final $6$ day period within
a few $Gyr$ But in the case of $5M_J$ oscillation modes excited in the star are
more important.

of orbits of subhaloes in high resolution cosmological simulations of dark
matter haloes. We find a trend for substructure to preferentially revolve in
the same direction as the sense of rotation of the host halo: there is an
excess of prograde satellite haloes. Throughout our suite of nine host haloes
(eight cluster sized objects and one galactic halo) there are on average 59% of
the satellites corotating with the host. Even when including satellites out to
five virial radii of the host, the signal still remains pointing out the
relation of the signal with the infall pattern of subhaloes. However, the
fraction of prograde satellites weakens to about 53% when observing the data
along a (random) line-of-sight and deriving the distributions in a way an
observer would infer them. This decrease in the observed prograde fraction has
its origin in the technique used by the observer to determine the sense of
rotation, which results in a possible misclassification of non-circular orbits.
We conclude that the existence of satellites on corotating orbits is another
prediction of the cold dark matter structure formation scenario, although there
will be difficulties to verify it observationally. Since the galactic halo
simulation gave the same result as the cluster-sized simulations, we assume
that the fraction of prograde orbits is independent of the scale of the system,
though more galactic simulations would be necessary to confirm this.

luminosity distance estimates from standardizable candles such as supernovae Ia
(SNe) - a Poissonian scatter for each SN and a coherent component due to
correlated fluctuations between different SNe. Increasing the number of SNe
helps reduce the first type of error but not the second. The coherent component
has been largely ignored in forecasts of dark energy parameter estimation from
upcoming SN surveys. For instance it is commonly thought, based on Poissonian
considerations, that peculiar motion is unimportant, even for a low redshift SN
survey such as the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory; z = 0.03 - 0.08), which
provides a useful anchor for future high redshift surveys by determining the SN
zero-point. We show that ignoring coherent peculiar motion leads to an
underestimate of the zero-point error by about a factor of 2, despite the fact
that SNfactory covers almost half of the sky. More generally, there are four
types of fluctuations: peculiar motion, gravitational lensing, gravitational
redshift and what is akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Peculiar motion
and lensing dominates at low and high redshifts respectively. Taking into
account all significant luminosity distance fluctuations due to large scale
structure leads to a degradation of up to 60% in the determination of the dark
energy equation of state from upcoming high redshift SN surveys, when used in
conjunction with a low redshift anchor such as the SNfactory. The most relevant
fluctuations are the coherent ones due to peculiar motion and the Poissonian
ones due to lensing, with peculiar motion playing the dominant role. We also
discuss to what extent the noise here can be viewed as a useful signal, and
whether corrections can be made to reduce the degradation.

infall velocity to the linear infall model with an exponential cutoff
introduced by Croft et al., we find that the best agreement is obtained for a

kinematics and chemical composition of RGB stars in the stream field located at
a projected distance of R = 20 kpc from M31's center. A mix of stellar
populations is found in this field. M31 RGB stars are isolated from Milky Way
dwarf star contaminants using a variety of spectral and photometric
diagnostics. The radial velocity distribution of RGB stars displays a clear
bimodality -- a primary peak centered at v = -513 km/s and a secondary one at v
= -417 km/s -- along with an underlying broad component that is presumably
representative of the smooth spheroid of M31. Both peaks are found to be
dynamically cold with intrinsic velocity dispersions of sigma(v) = 16 km/s. The
mean metallicity and metallicity dispersion of stars in the two peaks is also
found to be similar: [Fe/H] = -0.45 and sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.2. The observed
velocity of the primary peak is consistent with that predicted by dynamical
models for the stream, but there is no obvious explanation for the secondary
peak. The nature of the secondary cold population is unclear: it may represent:
(1) tidal debris from a satellite merger event that is superimposed on, but
unrelated to, the giant southern stream; (2) a wrapped around component of the
giant southern stream; (3) a warp or overdensity in M31's disk at R > 50 kpc

emission is developed. Using the head-on approximation for the Compton cross
section and taking into account angular effects from the star's orbital motion,
we derive expressions to calculate the spectrum of gamma rays when nonthermal
jet electrons Compton-scatter photons of the stellar radiation field.
Calculations are presented for power-law distributions of nonthermal electrons
that are assumed to be isotropically distributed in the comoving jet frame, and
applied to $\gamma$-ray observations of LS 5039. We conclude that (1) the TeV
emission measured with HESS cannot result only from Compton-scattered stellar
radiation (CSSR), but could be synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission or a
combination of CSSR and SSC; (2) fitting both the HESS data and the EGRET data
associated with LS 5039 requires a very improbable leptonic model with a very
hard electron spectrum. Because the gamma rays would be variable in a leptonic
jet model, the data sets are unlikely to be representative of a simultaneously
measured gamma-ray spectrum. We therefore attribute EGRET gamma rays primarily
to CSSR emission, and HESS gamma rays to SSC emission. Detection of periodic
modulation of the TeV emission from LS 5039 would favor a leptonic SSC or
cascade hadron origin of the emission in the inner jet, whereas stochastic
variability alone would support a more extended leptonic model. The puzzle of
the EGRET gamma rays from LS 5039 will be quickly solved with GLAST. (Abridged)

1. Fourteen sources are detected within 1.4 arcmin of the cluster center with 2
of these sources predicted to be not associated with the cluster (background
AGN or foreground objects). The neutron star X-ray transient, X1732-304, has
previously been observed in outburst within this globular cluster with the
outburst seen to last for at least 12 years. Here we find 4 sources that are
consistent with the ROSAT position for this transient, but none of the sources
are fully consistent with the position of a radio source detected with the VLA
that is likely associated with the transient. The most likely candidate for the
quiescent counterpart of the transient has a relatively soft spectrum and an
unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity of 2.6E32 ergs/s, quite typical of other
quiescent neutron stars. Assuming standard core cooling, from the quiescent
flux of this source we predict long (>400 yr) quiescent episodes to allow the
neutron star to cool. Alternatively, enhanced core cooling processes are needed
to cool down the core. However, if we do not detect the quiescent counterpart
of the transient this gives an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity upper limit of
8E31 ergs/s. We also discuss other X-ray sources within the globular cluster.
  From the estimated stellar encouter rate of this cluster we find that the
number of sources we detect is significantly higher than expected by the
relationship of Pooley et al. (2003).

measure HST's apparent focus at the time of the exposure. TinyTim can then be
used to model the PSF at any position on the ACS field of view. This obviates
the need for images of dense stellar fields at different focus values, or

stochastic noise that is added to the shape of point sources when distortion is

the regions badly affected by the dust lane. We also calculate the half-light

this object falls in the same region of the M_V versus log R_h diagram as do

within their half-light radius. These galaxies correspond to 3-sigma peaks in
the spherical collapse model if the total mass in the halo is assumed to be 20
times the dynamical mass within the half-light radius. This value yields
stellar mass to total mass ratios of 8%, compared to a cosmological baryon
fraction of 18% derived from WMAP3 alone. We further develop a method for
reconstructing the concentration halo parameter c of the progenitors of these

within the framework of monolithic collapse, the resulting distribution of c is
log-normal with a peak value of c~3-10 and a distribution width similar to the

sufficient to recover the tilt of the fundamental plane.

retrograde accretion disc (in't Zand et al. 1998) but also via the stellar wind
of the companion (Roberts et al. 2001), so that the variation of the accretion
rate from the disc does not cause significant variation in the observed X-ray

Unlike SNe Ia, calibration of GRB LIs using a low-redshift sample is difficult.
Based on the Bayesian theory, here we propose an approach to calibrate these
LIs without introducing a low-redshift GRB sample. The essential points of our
approach include, (1) calibrate the power-law indices in the LIs with a sample
of GRBs in a narrow redshift range (Delta z); and (2) marginalize the
coefficient of the LIs over a reasonable range of cosmological parameters. We
take our newly discovered multivariable GRB LIs as an example and test the
validity of our approach through simulations. We show that while the
coefficient strongly depends on the cosmological parameters, the power-law
indices do not as long as Delta z is small enough. The selection of Delta z for
a particular GRB sample could be judged according to the size and the
observational uncertainty of the sample. There is no preferable redshift to
perform the calibration of the indices, while a lower redshift is preferable
for the marginalization of the coefficient. The best strategy would be to
collect GRBs within a narrow redshift bin around a fiducial intermediate
redshift (e.g. z~1 or z~2), since the observed GRB redshift distribution is
found to peak around z=(1 - 2.5). Our simulation suggests that with the current
observational precision of measuring GRB isotropic energy, spectral break
energy, and the optical temporal break time, 25 GRBs within a redshift bin of
Delta z ~ 0.30 would give fine calibration to our luminosity
indicator(abridged).

adopt the alpha prescription for the viscosity. The radial-azimuthal component
of viscous stress tensor is assumed to be proportional to the total pressure in
the optically thick region, while the gas pressure in the optically thin
regime. The viscosity parameter, alpha, is taken to be 0.1. We find the
limit-cycle variation in luminosity between high and low states. When we set
the mass input rate from the outer disk boundary to be 100 L_E/c^2, the
luminosity suddenly rises from 0.3L_E to 2L_E, where L_E is the Eddington
luminosity. It decays after retaining high value for about 40 s. Our numerical
results can explain the variation amplitude and duration of the recurrent
outbursts observed in microquasar, GRS 1915+105. We show that the
multi-dimensional effects play an important role in the high-luminosity state.
In this state, the outflow is driven by the strong radiation force, and some
part of radiation energy dissipated inside the disk is swallowed by the black
hole due to the photon-trapping effects. This trapped luminosity is comparable
to the disk luminosity. We also calculate two more cases: one with a much
larger accretion rate than the critical value for the instability and the other
with the viscous stress tensor being proportional to the gas pressure only even
when the radiation pressure is dominant. We find no quasi-periodic light
variations in these cases. This confirms that the limit-cycle behavior found in
the simulations is caused by the disk instability.

synchrotron self-Compton effect has been taken into account to calculate the

evolution of the intracluster medium based on the ROSAT and ASCA distant

connection to the LX-T relation under the beta-model, the scaled gas profile is
nearly universal for the outer region and the LX(>0.2r500) is tightly related
to the temperature through T^3 rather than T^2. On the other hand, a large
density scatter exists in the core region and there is clearly a deviation from
the self-similar scaling for clusters with a small core size. A direct link
between the core size and the radiative cooling timescale suggest that t_cool
is a parameter to control the gas structure and the appearance of small cores
in regular clusters may be much connected with the thermal evolution. We derive
the luminosity-ambient temperature (T') relation, assuming the universal
temperature profile to find the dispersion around the relation significantly
decreases: L_1keV is almost constant for a wide range of t_cool. We further
examined the LX-Tbeta and LX-T'beta relations and showed a trend that merging
clusters segregate from the regular clusters on the planes. A good correlation
between t_cool and the X-ray morphology on the L_1keV-t_cool/t_age plane leads
us to define three phases according to the different level of cooling, and draw
a phenomenological picture: after a cluster collapses and t_cool falls below
t_age, the core cools radiatively with quasi-hydrostatic balancing in the
gravitational potential, and the central density gradually becomes higher to
evolve from an outer-core-dominant cluster to inner-core-dominant cluster.

concluding that the mass donor star of SS 433 is not a Wolf-Rayet star, we
propose that this strong wind out flows from a geometrically thick envelope of

the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon. This wind could also wrap the mass donor star, and
at larger distances (~ 40 AU), it might form a dust envelope from which the

to take a fresh look at the constraints that exist on alternatives to

to those of Maoz (1998) and demonstrate that an extremely wide range of other
possibilities can be excluded. In particular, we present the new argument that
for the velocity dispersions inferred for many galactic nuclei, even binaries
made of point masses cannot stave off core collapse because hard binaries are
so tight that they merge via emission of gravitational radiation before they
can engage in three-body or four-body interactions. We also show that under
these conditions core collapse leads inevitably to runaway growth of a central
black hole with a significant fraction of the initial mass, regardless of the
masses of the individual stars. For clusters of noninteracting low-mass objects
(from low-mass stars to elementary particles), relaxation of stars and compact
objects that pass inside the dark region will be accelerated by interactions
with the dark mass. If the dark region is instead a self-supported object such
as a fermion ball, then if stellar-mass black holes exist they will collide
with the object, settle, and consume it. The net result is that the keyhole
through which alternatives to supermassive black holes must pass is
substantially smaller and more contrived than it was even a few years ago.

enhances modifications of the emission rate as compared to vertically
unconfined 2D photonic crystals. The emission rate modifications inside the
membrane mimic the local electric field mode density in a simple 2D model. The
inhibition of emission saturates exponentially as the crystal size around the
source is increased, with a $1/e$ length that is inversely proportional to the
bandwidth of the emission gap. We obtain inhibition of emission only close to
the slab center. However, enhancement of emission persists even outside the
membrane, with a distance dependence which dependence can be understood by
analyzing the contributions to the spontaneous emission rate of the different
vertically guided modes of the membrane. Finally we show that the emission
changes can even be observed in experiments with ensembles of randomly oriented
dipoles, despite the contribution of dipoles for which no gap exists.

Evidences are given that the fractal dimension of the deposits remains constant

techniques. It is found that the distribution of growth probabilities obeys
multifractal scaling, i.e. it can be analyzed in terms of its $f(\alpha)$
multifractal spectrum. For low dipolar strengths, the $f(\alpha)$ spectrum is
similar to that of diffusion-limited aggregation. Our results suggest that for

single-band formalism [T. Thonhauser, D. Ceresoli, D. Vanderbilt, and R. Resta,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95}, 137205 (2005)], we work in the Wannier
representation and find that the magnetization is comprised of two
contributions, an obvious one associated with the internal circulation of
bulk-like Wannier functions in the interior and an unexpected one arising from
net currents carried by Wannier functions near the surface. Unlike the
single-band case, where each of these contributions is separately
gauge-invariant, in the multi-band formulation only the \emph{sum} of both
terms is gauge-invariant. Our final expression for the orbital magnetization
can be rewritten as a bulk property in terms of Bloch functions, making it
simple to implement in modern code packages. The reciprocal-space expression is
evaluated for 2d model systems and the results are verified by comparing to the
magnetization computed for finite samples cut from the bulk. Finally, while our
formal proof is limited to normal insulators, we also present a heuristic
extension to Chern insulators (having nonzero Chern invariant) and to metals.
The validity of this extension is again tested by comparing to the
magnetization of finite samples cut from the bulk for 2d model systems. We find
excellent agreement, thus providing strong empirical evidence in favor of the
validity of the heuristic formula.

applied to the homogeneous Bianchi type IX cosmological model. As a result, the
framework for the quantum theory of homogeneous cosmologies is developed. We
show that the theory is internally consistent, and prove that it possesses the
correct classical limit (the theory of general relativity). To emphasize the
special role that the constraints play in this new theory we, compare it to the
traditional ADM square-root and Wheeler-DeWitt quantization schemes. We show
that, unlike the traditional approaches, QG leads to a well-defined Schrodinger
equation for the wave-function of the universe that is inherently coupled to
the expectation value of the constraint equations. This coupling to the
constraints is responsible for the appearance of a coherent spacetime picture.
Thus, the physical meaning of the constraints of the theory is quite different
from Dirac's interpretation. In light of this distinctive feature of the
theory, we readdress the question of the dark energy effects in the Bianchi IX
cosmological model for highly non-classical quantum states. We show that, at
least for this model, for any choice of the initial wave function, the quantum
corrections will not produce the accelerated expansion of the universe.

the TeV and GUT scales. We study the phenomenological implications of these
compactifications at low energy. Three realistic scenarios can be identified
depending on whether the Standard Model lies on D3 or D7 branes and on the
value of the string scale. For the MSSM on D7 branes and the string scale

lower scales it is the stop. At the GUT scale the results of the fluxed MSSM
are reproduced, but now with all moduli stabilised. For the MSSM on D3 branes
we identify two realistic scenarios. The first one corresponds to an
intermediate string scale version of split supersymmetry. The second is a
stringy mSUGRA scenario. This requires tuning of the flux parameters to obtain
the GUT scale. Phenomenological constraints from dark matter, (g-2)_mu and
BR(b->s gamma) are considered for the three scenarios. We provide benchmark
points with the MSSM spectrum, making the models suitable for a detailed

coupling constant, this potential reduces to a mass term with a mass fixed in
terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter. This mass dependence allows the
existence of several free cases including massless and tachyonic sources. There
even exists a particular value of the nonminimal coupling parameter for which
the corresponding mass exactly compensates the contribution generated by the
negative scalar curvature, producing a genuinely massless field in this curved
background. The self-interacting case is studied in detail for the conformal
coupling. The resulting gravitational wave is formed by the superposition of
the free and the self-interaction contributions, except for a critical value of
the coupling constant where a non-perturbative effect relating the strong and
weak regimes of the source appears. We establish a correspondence between the
scalar source supporting an AdS wave and a pp wave by showing that their
respective pure radiation constraints are conformally related, while their
involved backgrounds are not. Finally, we consider the AdS waves for
topologically massive gravity and its limit to conformal gravity.

techniques to understand these diagrams in terms of a relatively small amount
of information, namely, at what heights various vertices of the graph should be

  We then show how Adinkras that are the graphs of N-dimensional cubes can be
obtained as the Adinkra for superfields satisfying constraints that involve
superderivatives. This dramatically widens the range of supermultiplets that
can be described using the superspace formalism and organizes them. Other
topologies for Adinkras are possible, and we show that it is reasonable that
these are also the result of constraining superfields using superderivatives.
  The family of Adinkras with an N-cubical topology, and so also the sequence
of corresponding irreducible supersymmetric multiplets, are arranged in a
cyclical sequence called the main sequence. We produce the N=1 and N=2 main
sequences in detail, and indicate some aspects of the situation for higher N.

highlight that in low-dimensions consensus is reached through a coarsening
process which requires less cognitive effort of the agents, with respect to the
mean-field case, but takes longer to complete. In 1-d the dynamics of the
boundaries is mapped onto a truncated Markov process from which we analytically
computed the diffusion coefficient. More generally we show that the convergence
process requires a memory per agent scaling as N and lasts a time N^{1+2/d} in
dimension d<5 (d=4 being the upper critical dimension), while in mean-field

which cause a motion of the cosmic material towards the nodes, resulting in the

non-elastic fluid, such as air, the research shows that the rotation will
produce an additional stress along the rotation axis direction, that is on the
normal direction of rotation plane. This result can be used to explain the lift

arrived at his retina simultaneously. Due to finite and constant velocity of
light these photons left the moving body at different times, since not all
points of the body are equidistant. In other words its image represents the
body as it was in several different times i.e. it is distorted and does not
correspond to its real appearance. The useful experimental arrangement is set
and then used to derive the general expression that transforms two-dimensional
stationary shapes to their apparent forms, which could be photographed once
they are set in motion. It is then used to simulate the so-called Gamow's
bicycle combined out of circles and straight lines. The simulation outlines two
important aspects of bike's motion: apparent distance of two points and
apparent velocity which are then discussed thoroughly. It is found that the
approaching body is elongated and its apparent speed is greater than its real
one (under certain conditions can exceed the speed of light), whereas the
receding one is contracted (but not in a matter of Lorentz contraction) with
the speed smaller than the real one. Both the apparent length and speed tends
to a certain limit when time tends to plus or minus infinity. The change of
both parameters takes place in the vicinity of the nearest approach to the
observer and is more rapid when the velocity greater and the distance is
smaller. When the moving vertical rod is seen at right angle, its total
apparent length is Lorentz contracted, however its interior is still distorted.
At the same conditions apparent velocity of a point equals its real one.
Finally it is proven that not only the apparent geometrical shape changes as
the body moves but also its color according to Doppler shift.

impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but
experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher order interactions
among large groups of elements play an important role. In the vertebrate
retina, we show that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with
strongly collective behavior in the responses of ten or more neurons.
Surprisingly, we find that this collective behavior is described quantitatively
by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher
order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising
models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by
correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or
error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such
behavior. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that
similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.

change accompanied by a change in network structure. On average the network
self-organizes to a state close to the transition between a fragmented state
and a state with a giant component. Furthermore, with increasing system size
both the average degree and the level of fragmentation decreases. We also
observe that the network keeps on actively evolving, although it does not have
to, thus suggesting a Red Queen-like situation where agents have to keep on
networking and responding to the moves of the others in order to stay
