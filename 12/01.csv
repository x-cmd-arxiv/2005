luminosities with halo/subhalo masses, based on a self-consistent treatment of
subhalo mass loss and the subhalo mass function. We find that, at high mass,
the mass-luminosity relation is almost independent of the actual luminosity
function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the characteristic luminosity
L*. Additionally, the shape of the total halo luminosity depends on the slope
of the subhalo mass function. For these high mass, cluster sized haloes, we
find that total luminosity scales as L_tot ~ M^0.88, while the luminosity of
the first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass, L_1 ~
M^0.28, in good agreement with observations and previous results. At low mass,
the resulting slope of the mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the
faint end slope of the luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation,
with approximately L ~ M^4.5 in the K-band. The average number of galaxies per
halo/cluster is also in very good agreement with observations, scaling as
M^0.9. In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of
observational data. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a
flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for Omega_m and sigma_8.
Within the WMAP+SDSS concordance plane of Tegmark et al. (2004), we find best
agreement around Omega_m=0.25 and sigma_8=0.8, also in very good agreement with
the results of the CMB+2dF study of Sanchez et al. (2005). We also check on
possible corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent
number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on the model
results based on the mass to light ratio, the occupation number, the group
luminosity function and the multiplicity function. (abridged)

found strong circular polarization ($\geq 0.3$%) in approximately 15% of our

however, we did find a few strong jet components to be circularly polarized.
The levels of circular polarization were typically in the range of $0.3-0.5$%
of the local Stokes-$I$. We found no strong correlations between fractional
circular polarization of jet cores and source type, redshift, EGRET detections,
linear polarization, or other observed parsec-scale jet properties. There were
differences between the circular-to-linear polarization ratios of two nearby
galaxies versus more distant quasars and BL Lac objects. We suggest this is
because the more distant sources either have (1) less depolarization of their
linear polarization, and/or (2) poorer effective linear resolution and
therefore their VLBA cores apparently contain a larger amount of linearly
polarized jet emission. The jet of 3C 84 shows a complex circular polarization
structure, similar to observations by Homan & Wardle five years earlier;
however, much of the circular polarization seems to have moved, consistent with
a proper motion of 0.06$c$. The jet of 3C 273 also has several circularly
polarized components, and we find their fractional circular polarization

quantitative results for these stars, and the difficulties involved in their
determination. We show how stars with similar luminosities can have different
luminosity classes while stars with similar spectral types and luminosity
classes can have significantly different luminosities. While the weak winds of
the dwarfs present serious difficulties for the determination of wind terminal
velocities we show that the supergiants have terminal velocities comparable to
OB supergiants in the Milky Way, agreement with theory. We also summarize
recent work demonstrating that the temperature dependence of wind terminal
velocities does not follow the widely adopted step-like approximation. Finally
we review surface compositons of OB stars in the SMC finding that 42 out of 45
OB stars with detailed surface abundances are enriched in nitrogen by a factor
\~10 or more. While these enhancements are consistent with those produced by
models with rotational mixing the rotational velocities of the sample are

experience from the two limiting idealized cases which have been studied in
great extent in the past: that of an aligned rotator where ideal MHD conditions
apply, and that of a misaligned rotator in vacuum. We construct a spindown
formula that takes into account the misalignment of the magnetic and rotation
axes, and the magnetospheric particle acceleration gaps. We show that near the
death line aligned rotators spin down much slower than orthogonal ones. In
order to test this approach, we use a simple Monte Carlo method to simulate the
evolution of pulsars and find a good fit to the observed pulsar distribution in
the P-Pdot diagram without invoking magnetic field decay. Our model may also
account for individual pulsars spinning down with braking index n < 3, by
allowing the corotating part of the magnetosphere to end inside the light
cylinder. We discuss the role of magnetic reconnection in determining the
pulsar braking index. We show, however, that n ~ 3 remains a good approximation
for the pulsar population as a whole. Moreover, we predict that pulsars near
the death line have braking index values n > 3, and that the older pulsar
population has preferentially smaller magnetic inclination angles. We discuss
possible signatures of such alignment in the existing pulsar data.

morphologies are determined by their clustocentric distance and their nearest
cluster's richness. We look at three tracers of star-formation history (i-band
absolute magnitude M_i, [g-r] color, and Halpha emission line equivalent width)
and two indicators of galaxy morphology (surface brightness and radial
concentration) for 52,569 galaxies in the redshift range of 0.015<z<0.068. We
find that our morphology indicators relate to the clustocentric distance only
indirectly through their relationships with stellar population and
starformation rate. Galaxies that are near the cluster center tend to be more
luminous, redder and have lower Halpha EW (ie, lower star-formation rates) than
those that lie near or outside the virial radius of the cluster. The detailed
relationships between these galaxy properties and clustocentric distance depend
on cluster richness. For richer clusters, we find that (i) the transition in
color and Halpha EW from cluster center to field values is more abrupt and
occurs closer to the cluster virial radius, and (ii) the color and Halpha EW
distributions are overall narrower than in less rich clusters. We also find
that the radial gradient seen in the luminosity distribution is strongest
around the smaller clusters and decreases as cluster richness increases. We
find there is a `characteristic distance' at around one virial radius (the
infall region) where the change with radius of galaxy property distributions is
most dramatic, but we find no evidence for infall-triggered star bursts. These
results suggest that galaxies `know' the distance to, and the size of, their
nearest cluster and they express this information in their star-formation
histories.

August 7, 2003. Using these observations, we determined new orbital epochs for
both circular and elliptical orbit models. The orbital epochs for both orbit
solutions agreed with each other and yielded an orbital period derivative
$\dot{P} / P = (0.4 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$. This value is
consistent with the earlier measurement of $\dot{P} / P = (2.9 \pm 2.1) \times
10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ at the $1 \sigma$ level and gives only an upper limit to the
orbital period decay. Our determination of the pulse frequency showed that the

of the universe is not caused by repulsive gravitation due to dark energy, but
is rather a result of inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter. In this

Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi universe model, and confront it with various
astrophysical observations. We find that such a model can easily explain the
observed luminosity distance-redshift relation of supernovae without the need
for dark energy, when the inhomogeneity is in the form of an underdense bubble
centered near the observer. With the additional assumption that the universe
outside the bubble is approximately described by a homogeneous Einstein-de
Sitter model, we find that the position of the first CMB peak can be made to
match the WMAP observations. Whether or not it is possible to reproduce the
entire CMB angular power spectrum in an inhomogeneous model without dark
energy, is still an open question.

with the Spitzer Space Telescope. These are the deepest infrared and X-ray
fields to date and cover a total area of ~0.1 square degrees. AGN are selected
on the basis of their hard (2-8 keV) X-ray emission. The median AGN infrared
luminosity is at least 10 times larger than the median for normal galaxies with
the same redshift distribution, suggesting that the infrared emission is
dominated by the central nucleus. The X-ray to infrared luminosity ratios of
GOODS AGN, most of which are at 0.5<z<1.5, are similar to the values obtained
for AGN in the local Universe. The observed infrared flux distribution has an
integral slope of ~1.5 and there are 1000 sources per square degree brighter
than ~50 uJy at 3-6 microns. The counts approximately match the predictions of
models based on AGN unification, in which the majority of AGN are obscured.
This agreement confirms that the faintest X-ray sources, which are dominated by
the host galaxy light in the optical, are obscured AGN. Using these Spitzer
data, the AGN contribution to the extragalactic infrared background light is
calculated by correlating the X-ray and infrared catalogues. This is likely to
be a lower limit given that the most obscured AGN are missed in X-rays. We
estimate the contribution of AGN missed in X-rays, using a population synthesis
model, to be ~45% of the observed AGN contribution, making the AGN contribution
to the infrared background at most ~2-10% in the 3-24 micron range, depending
on wavelength, lower than most previous estimates. The AGN contribution to the
infrared background remains roughly constant with source flux in the IRAC bands
but decreases with decreasing flux in the MIPS 24 um band, where the galaxy
population becomes more important.

obtained using flux density correlations of the data which were spatially
filtered to have the same u-v coverage. A multiwavelength search for
counterparts to the compact central X-ray source was made. Results: We compiled

strikingly close to CXOU J085201.4-461753. Our observations show no evidence
for the existence of a pulsar wind driven nebula associated with the point
X-ray source. Furthermore, Source 18 has a thermal spectrum with index +0.8 +/-
0.4, and appears to be the counterpart of the optical source Wray 16-30. In
spite of the absence of OIII emission lines as reported in the literature, we
find that this object could be explained as a low emission planetary nebula

that if the radio source 18 is actually a planetary nebula, then CXOU

universe is about half can be determined by correlating Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) temperature maps with 21-cm line maps at degree scales ($l\sim
100$). During reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces the
Doppler anisotropy of the CMB, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogen
induce the 21-cm line anisotropy. In our simplified model of inhomogeneous
reionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas a
negative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlation
provides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained by
presently. The signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 Mpc^-1) where
linear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionization
is averaged out. Since the Doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the
21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) in
redshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.
Furthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,
especially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: this
is analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the CMB being more
immune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. Therefore, we
argue that the Doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the
21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detected
signals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides the
strongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin. We show that
the Square Kilometer Array can easily measure the predicted correlation signal
for 1~year of survey observation.

SiO masers in the circumstellar envelope of the M-type semi-regular variable
star VX Sgr at 3 epochs during 1999 April-May. These high-resolution VLBA
images reveal a persistent ringlike distribution of SiO masers with a projected
radius of ~3 stellar radii. The typical angular size of 0.5 mas for individual
maser feature was estimated from two-point correlation function analysis for
maser spots. We found that the apparent size scale of maser features was
distinctly smaller than that observed in the previous observations by comparing
their fractions of total power imaged. This change in the size scale of maser
emission may be related to stellar activity that caused a large SiO flare
during our observations. Our observations confirmed the asymmetric distribution
of maser emission, but the overall morphology has changed significantly with
the majority of masers clustering to the north-east of the star compared to
that lying to the south-west direction in 1992. By identifying 42 matched maser
features appearing in all the three epochs, we determined the contraction of an
SiO maser shell toward VX Sgr at a proper motion of -0.507 mas/yr,
corresponding to a velocity of about 4 km/s at a distance of 1.7 kpc to VX Sgr.
Such a velocity is on the order of the sound speed, and can be easily explained
by the gravitational infall of material from the circumstellar dust shell.

numerical calculations of the effects that could be caused on Earth by a
Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), considering atmospheric and biological implications. The
main effects of the illumination by a GRB are classified in four distinct ones
and analyzed separately, namely: direct gamma Flash, UV Flash, Ozone Layer
Depletion and Cosmic Rays. The effectiveness of each of these effects is
compared and distances for significant biological damage are given for each
one. We find that the first three effects have potential to cause global
environmental changes and biospheric damages, even if the source is located at
Galactic distances or even farther (up to 150 kpc, about five times the
Galactic diameter of 30 kpc). Instead, cosmic rays would only be a serious
threat for close sources (on the order of a few pc). As a concrete application
from a well-recorded event, the effects on the biosphere of an event identical
to the giant flare of SGR1806-20 on Dec 27, 2004 have been calculated. In spite
of not beeing a classical GRB, most of the parameters of this recent flare are
quite well-known and have been used as a calibration for our study. We find
that a giant flare impinging on Earth is not a threat for life in all practical
situations, mainly because it is not as energetic, in spite of being much more
frequent than GRBs, unless the source happens to be extremely close.

In particular, it incorporates: (i) dark energy with time-varying

relativistic particles in the early universe; and (iii) a variety of physical
effects that cause deviations from the standard equation-of-state w=1/3 during

out to the cluster's half-mass radius (r_h ~ 2.2). The colour-magnitude diagram
(CMD) that we derive in this way reveals a narrow and well defined MS extending
down to the 5 sigma detection limit at V~25, or about 6 magnitudes below the
turn-off, corresponding to stars of ~ 0.25 Msolar. The luminosity function (LF)
obtained with these data shows a marked radial gradient, in that the ratio of
lower- and higher-mass stars increases monotonically with radius. The mass
function (MF) measured at the half-mass radius, and as such representative of
the clusters global properties, is surprisingly flat. Over the range 0.4 - 0.8
Msolar, the number of stars per unit mass follows a power-law distribution of
the type dN/dm \propto m^{0}, where, for comparison, Salpeter's IMF would be
dN/dm \propto m^{-2.35}. We expect that such a flat MF does not represent the
cluster's IMF but is the result of severe tidal stripping of the stars from the
cluster due to its interaction with the Galaxy's gravitational field. Our
results cannot be reconciled with the predictions of recent theoretical models
that imply a relatively insignificant loss of stars from NGC 6218 as measured
by its expected very long time to disruption. They are more consistent with the
orbital parameters based on the Hipparcos reference system that imply a much
higher degree of interaction of this cluster with the Galaxy than assumed by
those models. Our results indicate that, if the orbit of a cluster is known,
the slope of its MF could be useful in discriminating between the various
models of the Galactic potential.

framework of lattice driven diffusive systems. Motors, considered as hopping
particles, perform a highly biased asymmetric exclusion process when bound to
the filament. With a certain rate, they detach from the filament and execute
unbiased random walk in the bulk which is considered as a closed cubic
compartment. Motors are injected (extracted) from the leftmost (rightmost) site
of the filament located along the symmetry axis of the compartment. We explore
the transport properties of this system and investigate the bulk-boundary
interplay on the system stationary states. It is shown that the detachment rate
notably affects the system properties. In particular and in contrast to ASEP,
it is shown that the density profile of bound particles exhibit different types
of non monotonic behaviours when the detachment rate varies. It is shown that
in certain situations, the density profile of the filament consists of
coexisting high and low regions.

we study the current vertex corrections (CVC) based on the fluctuation exchange

simultaneous rupture of several elements occur, with a distribution $D(\Delta)$

power law $D(\Delta)\propto\Delta^{-\xi}$. For the systems we study here, a
crossover behavior is seen between two power laws, with a small exponent $\xi$

away from the breakdown point. We demonstrate this analytically for bundles of

In this case $\xi=3/2$ near the breakdown point and $\xi=5/2$ away from it. The
latter is known to be the generic behavior. This crossover is a signal of
imminent catastrophic failure of the material. Near the breakdown point,
avalanche statistics show nontrivial finite size scaling. We observe similar
crossover behavior in a network of electric fuses, and find $\xi=2$ near the
catastrophic failure and $\xi=3$ away from it. For this fuse model power
dissipation avalanches show a similar crossover near breakdown.

The combinatorial basis is shown to be the most fundamental (most primitive) of

cross-entropy and Shannon entropy functions, as simplified forms of the
multinomial distribution subject to the Stirling approximation; (ii) an
explanation for the need to maximize entropy (or minimize cross-entropy) to
find the most probable realization; and (iii) new, generalized definitions of
entropy and cross-entropy - supersets of the Boltzmann principle - applicable
to non-multinomial systems. The combinatorial basis is therefore of much
broader scope, with far greater power of application, than the
information-theoretic and axiomatic bases. The generalized definitions underpin
a new discipline of ``{\it combinatorial information theory}'', for the
analysis of probabilistic systems of any type.

and long-time behaviour of space-time correlations in both systems. The dynamic
structure factor of the coupled map lattice (CML) of logistic units in its deep
chaotic regime and the usual d=1 KPZ equation have a similar temporal stretched
exponential relaxation. Conversely, the spatial scaling and, in particular, the
size dependence are very different due to the intrinsic confinement of the
fluctuations in the CML. We discuss the range of values of the non-linear
parameter in the logistic map elements and the elastic coefficient coupling
neighbours on the ring for which the connection with the KPZ-like equation
holds. In the same spirit, we derive a continuum partial differential equation
governing the evolution of the Lyapunov vector and we confirm that its
space-time behaviour becomes the one of KPZ. Finally, we briefly discuss the
interpretation of the continuum limit of the CML as a

electron-phonon coupling induced by the Hubbard repul sion depends in a

selects the fittest neural networks. The probability of a successful genetic
attack is calculated for different model parameters using numerical
simulations. The results show that scaling laws observed in the case of other
attacks hold for the improved algorithm, too. The number of networks needed for
an effective attack grows exponentially with increasing synaptic depth. In

analyzed. These learning rules converge to the random walk rule if the synaptic

  Computer Press, Timisoara, Romania, Sep. 25-29, 2005",,,,"cs.DC",,"  Wasps, bees, ants and termites all make effective use of their environment
and resources by displaying collective swarm intelligence. Termite colonies -
for instance - build nests with a complexity far beyond the comprehension of
the individual termite, while ant colonies dynamically allocate labor to
various vital tasks such as foraging or defense without any central
decision-making ability. Recent research suggests that microbial life can be
even richer: highly social, intricately networked, and teeming with
interactions, as found in bacteria. What strikes from these observations is
that both ant colonies and bacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on
Stigmergy and Self-Organization in order to emerge coherent and sophisticated
patterns of global behaviour. Keeping in mind the above characteristics we will
present a simple model to tackle the collective adaptation of a social swarm
based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA algorithm) for tracking extrema in
dynamic environments and highly multimodal complex functions described in the
well-know De Jong test suite. Then, for the purpose of comparison, a recent
model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA algorithm) based on similar
stigmergic features is described and analyzed. Final results indicate that the
SSA collective intelligence is able to cope and quickly adapt to unforeseen
situations even when over the same cooperative foraging period, the community
is requested to deal with two different and contradictory purposes, while
outperforming BFOA in adaptive speed.

Dadhich highlights the fact that the apparently ``self-evident'' assumption of

cosmological models though no general proof for non-occurrence of trapped
surfaces exists in the cosmological context. However, Dadhich added, without
sufficient justification, that trapped surfaces should occur for collapse of
isolated bodies. We point out that actually trapped surfaces do not occur even
for collapse of spherically symmetric isolated bodies. Further unlike the
cosmological case, for isolated bodies, an exact proof for generic
non-occurrence of trapped surfaces is available. Thus for isolated bodies, the
above referred apparently ``self-evident'' assumption fails much more acutely
than in cosmology. Many recent astrophysical observations tend to corroborate
the fact trapped surfaces do not occur for isolated bodies. Two recent specific
papers (PRD) are cited to show that when radiative non-diispative collapse can
prevent formation of trapped surfaces.

$1.1\times 10^{-9}$, while the ""popcorn"" noise has an amplitude about one order
of magnitude higher and the maximum occurs around a frequency of 1.2 kHz. The
signal is below the sensitivity of the first generation of detectors but could
be detectable by the future generation of ground based interferometers.

integral of motion corresponding to this symmetry, the integral of motion is
similar to the mass function in general relativity (GR). Space closure with
respect to the extra dimensionality follows from the requirement of the absence
of a conical singularity. Thus, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) model is realized
dynamically as a Lorentz-invariant mode of five-dimensional general relativity.
After the dimensional reduction and conformal mapping the model is reduced to
the GR configuration. It contains a scalar field with a vanishing conformally
invariant energy-momentum tensor on the flat space-time background. This zero
mode can be interpreted as a vacuum configuration in GR. As a result the
vacuum-like configuration in GR can be considered as a manifestation of the

different inconsistencies in the standard treatment of chiral quark models at

incorporated and an effective theory of quarks and Polyakov loops as basic

suppression of finite temperature effects in hadronic observables below the
deconfinement phase transition triggered by approximate triality conservation
in a phase where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken (Polyakov cooling). We
also propose a simple phenomenological model to describe the available lattice

analysis shows that non perturbative contributions driven by dimension-2 gluon
condensates dominate the behaviour of the Polyakov loop in the regime T_c < T <

based on the Hawking--Unruh effect: an observer moving with an acceleration $a$
experiences the influence of a thermal bath with an effective temperature $T =

In the case of heavy ion collisions, the acceleration is caused by a pulse of
chromo--electric field $E \sim Q_s^2/g$ ($Q_s$ is the saturation scale, and $g$
is the strong coupling), the typical acceleration is $a \sim Q_s$, and the heat
bath temperature is $T \simeq Q_s / 2\pi \sim 200$ MeV. In nuclear collisions
at sufficiently high energies the effect can induce a rapid thermalization over
the time period of $\tau \sim \pi/Q_s $ accompanied by phase transitions. A
specific example of chiral symmetry restoration induced by the chromo--electric
field is considered; it is mathematically analogous to the phase transition
occurring in the vicinity of a black hole.

realized as neutral matter in compact star cores. However, smooth form factors

quantum field theory from first principles. There has been important progress
in our analytical understanding based on 2PI generating functionals. In
addition, for the first time direct lattice simulations based on stochastic
quantization techniques have been achieved. The quantitative descriptions of
characteristic far-from-equilibrium time scales and thermal equilibration in
quantum field theory point out new phenomena such as prethermalization. They
determine the range of validity of standard transport or semi-classical
approaches, on which most of our ideas about nonequilibrium dynamics were based
so far. These are crucial ingredients to understand important topical phenomena
in high-energy physics related to collision experiments of heavy nuclei, early
universe cosmology and complex many-body systems.

the atoms' initial momentum distribution is studied as well as the dependence
of the expected fractal dimension on finite-size effects of the experiment,
such as finite detection windows and short measurement times. Our results show
that clear signatures of fractality could be observed in experiments with cold
atoms subjected to periodically flashed optical lattices, which offer an
excellent control on interaction times and the initial atomic ensemble.

utilizing a capillary discharge were demonstrated. An intense current pulse is
applied to a gas filled capillary, inducing magnetic collapse (Z-pinch) and
formation of a highly ionized plasma column. Usually, a small current pulse
(pre-pulse) is applied to the gas in order to pre-ionize it prior to the onset
of the main current pulse. In this paper we investigate the effects of the
pre-pulse on a capillary discharge Ne-like Ar XUV laser (46.9nm). The
importance of the pre-pulse in achieving suitable initial conditions of the gas
column and preventing instabilities during the collapse is demonstrated.
Furthermore, measurements of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)
properties (intensity, duration) in different pre-pulse currents revealed
unexpected sensitivity. Increasing the pre-pulse current by a factor of two
caused the ASE intensity to decrease by an order of magnitude - and to nearly
disappear. This effect is accompanied by a slight increase in the lasing
duration. We attribute this effect to axial flow in the gas during the
pre-pulse.

ideal fluids are considered. The study is based on a Hamiltonian approach. It
concentrates on values of the density ratio close to a critical one, where the
supercritical bifurcation changes to the subcritical one. As the solitary wave
velocity approaches the minimum phase velocity of linear interfacial waves (the
bifurcation point), the solitary wave solutions transform into envelope
solitons. In order to describe their behavior and bifurcations, a generalized
nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation describing the behavior of solitons and
their bifurcations is derived. In comparison with the classical NLS equation
this equation takes into account three additional nonlinear terms: the
so-called Lifshitz term responsible for pulse steepening, a nonlocal term
analogous to that first found by Dysthe for gravity waves and the six-wave
interaction term. We study both analytically and numerically two solitary wave
families of this equation for values of the density ratio $\rho$ that are both
above and below the critical density ratio $\rho_{cr}$. For $\rho>\rho_{cr}$,
the soliton solution can be found explicitly at the bifurcation point. The
maximum amplitude of such a soliton is proportional to $\sqrt{\rho-\rho_{cr}}$,
and at large distances the soliton amplitude decays algebraically. A stability
analysis shows that solitons below the critical ratio are stable in the
Lyapunov sense in the wide range of soliton parameters. Above the critical
density ratio solitons are shown to be unstable with respect to finite
perturbations.

obtained via a complete integration of the Pauli equation over time and space.
The probability density evolution describes a slipping of the wave packet into
two separate packets due to the measurement device, but it cannot account for
impacts.

explain impacts naturally, but also accounts for the spin quantization

or the cavity or both can be probed by lasers, with or without the presence of
traps inducing local atomic frequency shifts. It is shown that, albeit the
(possibly strong) coupling between atom and cavity, it is sufficient for
deriving the momentum diffusion to consider that the atom couples to a mean
cavity field, which gives a first contribution, and that the cavity mode
couples to a mean atomic dipole, giving a second contribution. Both
contributions have an intuitive form and present a clear symmetry. The total
diffusion is the sum of these two contributions plus the diffusion originating
from the fluctuations of the forces due to the coupling to the vacuum modes
other than the cavity mode (the so called spontaneous emission term). Examples
are given that help to evaluate the heating rates induced by an optical cavity
for experiments operating at low atomic saturation. We also point out
intriguing situations where the atom is heated although it cannot scatter
light.

cloning of single photon polarization is possible when the gain factor of the
amplification is equal to the inverse squareroot of 1-R.

in order to discuss the entanglement properties of these systems. First,
integrable quantum dissipative models are discussed, i.e., the quantum Brownian
motion and the quantum harmonic oscillator. In case of the free particle, the
related entanglement of formation shows no non-analyticity. In case of the
dissipative harmonic oscillator, there is a non-analyticity at the transition
of underdamped to overdamped oscillations. We argue that this might be a
general property of dissipative systems. We show that similar features arise in
the dissipative two level system and study different regimes using sub-Ohmic,
Ohmic and and super-Ohmic baths, within a scaling approach.

system which is no longer incoherently pumped on the transition at which lasing
occurs. The four-level system can overcome some limits in the typical
lambda-type and V-type three-level systems, furthermore it is possible to
achieve lasing even in the absence of the inversion condition for the thermal
radiation fields or of the inversion of spontaneous decay rate. We find that
when the detuning of probe field is equal to that of coherent coupling field,
there is a peak value along with the increase of the detuning. To explain it,
we bring forward that there are adiabatic and nonadiabatic stimulated Raman
processes when a three-level atomic system is interacted with two coherent
fields, so there are two mechanisms influencing the change of probe field. We
believe that it can explain more general lasing without inversion processes
because of quantum interference induced by coherent fields.
