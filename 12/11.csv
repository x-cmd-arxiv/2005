massive stars in their earliest evolutionary stage, the clusters should also be

reflect properties associated with their formation rather than their evolution.
For each cluster, we estimate the mass, the morphological type, the photometry
and extinction. The clusters in our study, by their association with massive
protostars and massive outflows, reinstate the notion that massive stars begin
to form after the first generation of low mass stars have completed their
accretion phase. Further, the observed high gas densities and accretion rates
at the centers of these clusters is consistent with the hypothesis that high
mass stars form by continuing accretion onto low mass stars.

obtained by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), provide one of the
most precise data sets to test fundamental hypotheses of modern cosmology. One
of these issues is related to the statistical properties of the CMB temperature
fluctuations, which would have been produced by Gaussian random density
fluctuations when matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium in the early
Universe. We analysed here the WMAP data and found that the distribution of the
CMB temperature fluctuations P^{CMB}(Delta T) can be quite well fitted by the
anomalous temperature distribution emerging within nonextensive statistical
mechanics. This theory is based on the nonextensive entropy S_q = k (1 - \int
dx [P_q(x)]^q) /(q-1), with the Boltzmann-Gibbs expression as the limit case q
-> 1. For the frequencies investigated (\nu= 40.7, 60.8, and 93.5 GHz), we
found that P^{CMB}(Delta T) is well described by P_q(Delta T) \propto 1/[1 +
(q-1) B(\nu) (Delta T)^2]^{1/(q-1)}, with q = 1.055 \pm 0.002, which exclude,
at the 99% confidence level, exact Gaussian temperature distributions
P^{Gauss}(Delta T) \propto e^{- B(\nu) Delta T^2}, corresponding to the q -> 1
limit, to properly represent the CMB temperature fluctuations measured by WMAP.

of the telescope and wide spectral coverage of the spectrograph allowed us to
detect several H_2 and [Fe II] lines in the H- and K-bands. These include H_2
lines arising from v=1-3 and J=1-11, and [Fe II] lines with upper level
energies of E/k=1.1-2.7x10^4 K. For all objects the outflow is found to have
two velocity components: (1) a high-velocity (-70 to -130 km s^-1) component
(HVC), seen in [Fe II] or H_2 emission and associated with a collimated jet;
and (2) a low-velocity (-10 to -30 km s^-1) component (LVC), which is seen in
H_2 emission only and is spatially more compact. Such a kinematic structure
resembles optical forbidden emission line outflows associated with classical T
Tauri stars, whereas the presence of H_2 emission reflects the low-excitation
nature of the outflowing gas close to these protostars. The observed H_2 flux
ratios indicate a temperature of 2-3x10^3 K, and a gas density of 10^5 cm^-3 or
more, supporting shocks as the heating mechanism. B5-IRS 1 exhibits faint
extended emission associated with the H_2-LVC, in which the radial velocity
slowly increases with distance from the protostar (by ~20 km s^-1 at ~500 AU).
This is explained as warm molecular gas entrained by an unseen wide-angled
wind. The [Fe II] flux ratios indicate electron densities to be ~10^4 cm^-3 or
greater, similar to forbidden line outflows associated with classical T Tauri
stars. Finally the kinematic structure of the [Fe II] emission associated with
the base of the B5-IRS 1 and HH 34 IRS outflows is shown to support disk-wind
models.

bursts (GRBs) and compare them with that of the long GRBs by using the
CGRO/BATSE GRB Catalog. Our results are as follows. (1)The spectral lag
distribution of the short GRBs is significantly different from that of the long
GRBs. Excluding the statistical fluctuation effect, a proportion of ~17% of the
short GRBs have a negative spectral lag, i.e., the hard photons being lag
behind the soft photons. We do not find any peculiar features from their light
curves to distinguish these bursts from those with a positive spectral lag. We
argue that a more physical mechanism dominated the hard lag may be hid behind
the morphological features of the light curves. This should be a great
challenge to the current GRB models. We notice that this proportion is
consistent with the proportion of short GRBs correlated with nearby galaxies
newly discovered by Tanvir et al., although it is unclear if these short GRBs
are indeed associated with the sources originated at low redshift. (2)While the
spectral lags of the long GRBs are strongly correlated with the pulse
durations, they are not for the short GRBs. However, the ratios of the spectral
lag to the pulse duration for the short and long GRBs normally distributed at
0.023 and 0.046, respectively, with the sample width, indicating that the
curvature effect alone could not explain the difference of the spectral lags
between the two types of GRBs. The hydrodynamic timescales of the outflows and
the radiative processes at work in GRBs might also play an important role as
suggested by Daigne and Mochkovitch.

of 1/1000. It implies that (1) GRB's peak at a significantly higher redshift
than supernovae; (2) massive star evolution at low metallicity may be
qualitatively different and; (3) the larger the low-metallicity bias of GRBs
the less likely binary evolution channels can be significant GRB producers.

azimuthal--vertical plane of the disk is considered where we include the
Coriolis force and the radial advection of the Keplerian rotation flow. Dust
grains, treated as individual particles, move under the influence of friction
with the gas, while the gas is treated as a compressible fluid. The friction
force from the dust grains on the gas leads to a vertical shear in the gas
rotation velocity. As the particles settle around the mid-plane due to gravity,
the shear increases, and eventually the flow becomes unstable to the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence saturates when
the vertical settling of the dust is balanced by the turbulent diffusion away
from the mid-plane. The azimuthally averaged state of the self-sustained
Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence is found to have a constant Richardson number in
the region around the mid-plane where the dust-to-gas ratio is significant.
Nevertheless the dust density has a strong non-axisymmetric component. We
identify a powerful clumping mechanism, caused by the dependence of the
rotation velocity of the dust grains on the dust-to-gas ratio, as the source of
the non-axisymmetry. Our simulations confirm recent findings that the critical
Richardson number for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is around unity or larger,

transitions via the 3-dimensional O(N) vector model, accurate predictions for
critical exponents can be obtained from (resummation of) the perturbative
series of Renormalization-Group functions, which are in turn derived
--following Parisi's approach-- from the expansions of appropriate field
correlators evaluated at zero external momenta.
  Such a technique was fully exploited 30 years ago in two seminal works of
Baker, Nickel, Green and Meiron, which lead to the knowledge of the
$\beta$-function up to the 6-loop level; they succeeded in obtaining a precise
numerical evaluation of all needed Feynman amplitudes in momentum space by
lowering the dimensionalities of each integration with a cleverly arranged set
of computational simplifications. In fact, extending this computation is not
straightforward, due both to the factorial proliferation of relevant diagrams
and the increasing dimensionality of their associated integrals; in any case,
this task can be reasonably carried on only in the framework of an automated
environment.
  On the road towards the creation of such an environment, we here show how a
strategy closely inspired by that of Nickel and coworkers can be stated in
algorithmic form, and successfully implemented on the computer. As an
application, we plot the minimized distributions of residual integrations for
the sets of diagrams needed to obtain RG-functions to the full 7-loop level;
they represent a good evaluation of the computational effort which will be
required to improve the currently available estimates of critical exponents.

periodic potential, with repulsive interactions. We chiefly consider the most
fundamental case of the inter-species repulsion with zero intra-species
interactions. Existence and stability regions for gap solitons (GSs) supported
by the interplay of the inter-species repulsion and periodic potential are
identified. Two-component GSs are constructed by means of the variational
approximation (VA) and in a numerical form. The VA provides accurate
description for the GS which is a bound state of two tightly-bound components,
each essentially trapped in one cell of the periodic potential. GSs of this
type dominate in the case of intra-gap solitons, with both components belonging
to the first finite bandgap of the linear spectrum. Inter-gap solitons, with
one component residing in the second bandgap, and intra-gap solitons which have
both components in the second gap, are possible in a deeper periodic potential,
with the strength essentially exceeding the recoil energy of the atoms.
Inter-gap solitons are, typically, bound states of one tightly- and one
loosely-bound components. In this case, results are obtained in a numerical
form. For 2D solitons, the stability is identified in direct simulations, while
in the 1D case it is done via eigenfrequencies of small perturbations, and then
verified by simulations. In the latter case, if the intra-gap soliton in the
first bandgap is weakly unstable, it evolves into a stable breather, while
unstable solitons of other types get completely destroyed. The intra-gap 2D
solitons in the first bandgap are less robust, and in some cases they are
completely destroyed by the instability. Addition of intra-species repulsion to
the repulsion between the components leads to further stabilization of the GSs.

direct experimental searches, such as LEP and Tevatron experiments, gave robust
lower bounds on the masses of these particles, the cosmic dark matter can give
some upper bounds and thus have important implications for the searches at
future colliders. In this work we scrutinize such dark matter constraints and
show the allowed mass range for charginos and neutralinos (the mass eigenstates
of gauginos and Higgsinos). We find that the lightest chargino must be lighter

other cases. The corresponding production rates of the lightest chargino at the

production rate can be larger than 1 pb at LHC and 100 fb at the ILC, other
parts of the region correspond to very small production rates and thus there is

system whose classical equations of motion do not necessarily follow from the
least action principle. The idea of the method is in assigning a certain BRST
operator $\hat\Omega$ to any classical equations of motion, Lagrangian or not.
The generating functional of Green's functions is defined by the equation
$\hat\Omega Z (J) = 0$ that is reduced to the standard Schwinger-Dyson equation
whenever the classical field equations are Lagrangian. The corresponding
probability amplitude $\Psi$ of a field $\phi$ is defined by the same equation
$\hat\Omega \Psi (\phi) = 0$ although in another representation. When the
classical dynamics are Lagrangian, the solution for $\Psi (\phi)$ is reduced to
the Feynman amplitude $e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}S}$, while in the non-Lagrangian case
this amplitude can be a more general distribution.

suggested that life began with a set of simpler, collectively replicating
elements, such as an enclosed autocatalytic set of polymers (or protocell).
Since replication occurs without a self-assembly code, acquired characteristics
are inherited. Moreover, there is no strict distinction between alive and dead;
one can only infer that a protocell was alive if it replicates. These features
of early life render natural selection inapplicable to the description of its
change-of-state because they defy its underlying assumptions. Moreover, natural
selection describes only randomly generated novelty; it cannot describe the
emergence of form at the interface between organism and environment.
Self-organization is also inadequate because it is restricted to interactions
amongst parts; it too cannot account for context-driven change. A modified
version of selection theory or self-organization would not work because the
description of change-of-state through interaction with an incompletely
specified context has a completely different mathematical structure, i.e.
entails a non-Kolmogorovian probability model. It is proposed that the
evolution of early life is appropriately described as lineage transformation
through context-driven actualization of potential (CAP), with self-organized
change-of-state being a special case of no contextual influence, and
competitive exclusion of less fit individuals through a selection-like process
possibly (but not necessarily) playing a secondary role. It is argued that
natural selection played an important role in evolution only after genetically
mediated replication was established.
