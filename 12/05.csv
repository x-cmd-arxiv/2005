an impressive ground-based followup effort as well as space-based followup from
Swift. The Swift data from the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and our own optical
photometry and spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for our
analysis. Under the traditional assumption that the visible waveband was above
the peak synchrotron frequency and below the cooling frequency, the optical
photometry from 0.03 to 5.03 days show an afterglow decay corresponding to an
electron energy index of p_lc = 2.05 +/- 0.04, without a jet break as suggested
by others. A break is seen in the X-ray data at early times (at ~12600 sec
after the GRB). The spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent with
p_lc assuming a host-galaxy extinction of A_V = 1.18 mag. The optical-NIR
broadband spectrum is also consistent with p = 2.05, but prefers A_V = 0.57
mag. The X-ray afterglow shows a break at 1.26 x 10^4 sec, which may be the
result of a refreshed shock. This burst stands out in that the optical and
X-ray data suggest a large H I column density of N_HI ~ 10^22 cm^-2; it is very
likely a damped Lyman alpha system and so the faintness of the host galaxy (M_V
> -18 mag) is noteworthy. Moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong Ti II
absorption lines with a column density through the GRB host that exceeds the
largest values observed for the Milky Way by an order of magnitude.
Furthermore, the Ti II equivalent width is in the top 1% of Mg II
absorption-selected QSOs. This suggests that the large-scale environment of GRB
050408 has significantly lower Ti depletion than the Milky Way and a large
velocity width (delta v > 200 km/s).

evolution of the Gunn-Peterson optical depth in the Ly alpha,beta, and gamma;
(b) the distribution of dark absorption gaps, and (c) the size of HII regions
around quasars. We find that the evolution of the IGM accelerated at z>5.7: the
optical depth evolution changes from tau ~ (1+z)^{4.3} to (1+z)^{>11}, and the
average length of dark gaps with tau>3.5 increases from <10 to >80 comoving
Mpc. The dispersion of IGM properties along different lines of sight also
increases rapidly, implying fluctuations by a factor of >4 in the UV background
at z>6, when the mean free path of UV photons is comparable to the correlation
length of galaxies. The mean length of dark gaps shows the most dramatic
increase at z~6, as well as the largest varianace. We suggest using dark gap
statistics as a powerful probe of the ionization state of the IGM at yet higher
redshift. The sizes of HII regions around quasars decrease rapidly towards
higher redshift, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the IGM has increased
by a factor of >10 from z=5.7 to 6.4. The mass-averaged neutral fraction is
1-4% at z~6.2 based on the GP optical depth and HII region sizes. The

the finite length of dark absorption gaps.

determined from HST STIS spectroscopy around the BIII 2066A line. Boron
abundances provide a unique and critical test of stellar evolution models that
include rotational mixing since boron is destroyed in the surface layers of
stars through shallow mixing long before other elements are mixed from the
stellar interior through deep mixing. Boron abundances range from 12+log(B/H) =
1.0 to 2.2. The boron abundances are compared to the published values of their
stellar nitrogen abundances (all have 12+log(N/H) < 7.8, i.e., they do not show
significant CNO-mixing) and to their host cluster ages (4 to 16 Myr) to
investigate the predictions from models of massive star evolution with
rotational mixing effects (Heger & Langer 2000). Only three stars (out of 34)
deviate from the model predictions, including HD36591, HD205021, and HD30836.
These three stars suggest that rotational mixing could be more efficient than
currently modelled at the highest rotation rates.

short-period, low-mass hot-Neptune planets characteristic of $\mu$ Ara-like

subsequent evolution taking into account irradiation and evaporation provide a
viable formation mechanism for this type of strongly irradiated light planets.
At an orbital distance $a \simeq$ 0.1 AU, this revised core accretion model
leads to the formation of planets with total masses ranging from $\sim$ 14
$\mearth$ (0.044 $\mjup$) to $\sim$ 400 $\mearth$ (1.25 $\mjup$). The newly
born planets have a dense core of $\sim$ 6 $\mearth$, independent of the total
mass, and heavy element enrichments in the envelope, $M_{\rm Z,env}/M_{\rm env}
$, varying from 10% to 80% from the largest to the smallest planets. We examine
the dependence of the evolution of the born planet on the evaporation rate due
to the incident XUV stellar flux. In order to reach a $\mu$ Ara-like mass
($\sim$ 14 $\mearth$) after $\sim $ 1 Gyr, the initial planet mass must range
from 166 $\mearth$ ($\sim$ 0.52 $\mjup$) to about 20 $\mearth$, for evaporation
rates varying by 2 orders of magnitude, corresponding to 90% to 20% mass loss
during evolution. The presence of a core and heavy elements in the envelope
affects appreciably the structure and the evolution of the planet and yields
$\sim 8%-9%$ difference in radius compared to coreless objects of solar
composition for Saturn-mass planets. These combinations of evaporation rates
and internal compositions translate into different detection probabilities, and
thus different statistical distributions for hot-Neptunes and hot-Jupiters.

parameters, the line of sight velocity temporal variations at photospheric and
chromospheric heights. Chromospheric velocity oscillations show a three minute
period with a clear sawtooth shape typical of propagating shock wave fronts.
Photospheric velocity oscillations have basically a five minute period,
although the power spectrum also shows a secondary peak in the three minute
band which has proven to be predecessor for its chromospheric counterpart. The
derived phase spectra yield a value of the atmospheric cut-off frequency around
4 mHz and give evidence for the upward propagation of higher frequency
oscillation modes. The phase spectrum has been reproduced with a simple model
of linear vertical propagation of slow magneto-acoustic waves in a stratified
magnetized atmosphere that accounts for radiative losses through Newton's
cooling law. The model explains the main features in the phase spectrum, and
allows us to compute the theoretical time delay between the photospheric and
chromospheric signals, which happens to have a strong dependence on frequency.
We find a very good agreement between this and the time delay obtained directly
from the cross-correlation of photospheric and chromospheric velocity maps
filtered around the 6 mHz band. This allows us to infer that the 3-minute power
observed at chromospheric heights comes directly from the photosphere by means
of linear wave propagation, rather than from non-linear interaction of 5-minute

where sources with very different outflow activity can be found. This is
consistent with other studies showing that among ClassI one can find objects
with different accretion properties and it demonstrates that the H2 power in
the jet can be a powerful tool to identify the most active sources of this
class.

astrometric grid stars for the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest).
Data are analyzed for 775 stars selected from the Grid Giant Star Survey
spanning a wide range of effective temperatures (Teff), gravities and
metallicities. The spectra are used to determine these stellar parameters and
to monitor radial velocity (RV) variability at the 100 m/s level. The degree of
RV variation measured for 489 stars observed two or more times is explored as a
function of the inferred stellar parameters. The percentage of radial velocity
unstable stars is found to be very high -- about 2/3 of our sample. It is found
that the fraction of RV-stable red giants (at the 100 m/s level) is higher
among stars with Teff \sim 4500 K, corresponding to the calibration-independent
range of infrared colors 0.59 < (J-K_s)_0 < 0.73. A higher percentage of
RV-stable stars is found if the additional constraints of surface gravity and
metallicity ranges 2.3< log g < 3.2 and -0.5 < [Fe/H] < -0.1, respectively, are
applied. Selection of stars based on only photometric values of effective
temperature (4300 K < Teff < 4700 K) is a simple and effective way to increase
the fraction of RV-stable stars. The optimal selection of RV-stable stars,
especially in the case when the Washington photometry is unavailable, can rely
effectively on 2MASS colors constraint 0.59 < (J-K_s)_0 < 0.73. These results
have important ramifications for the use of giant stars as astrometric

relaxation ($\mu$SR), neutron and Raman scattering, and angle-resolved

$^{4}$He. The 41 meV neutron resonance mode and the ARPES superconducting
coherence peak (SCP) can be viewed as direct observations of spin and charge
soft modes, respectively, appearing near ($\pi,\pi$) and the center of the
Brillouin zone, having identical energy transfers and dispersion relations. We
present a conjecture that the mode energy of this twin spin/charge collective
excitation, as a roton analogue in HTSC, plays a primary role in determining
$T_{c}$, together with the superfluid density $n_{s}/m^{*}$ at $T \to 0$. We
further propose a microscopic model for pairing based on a resonant spin-charge
motion, which explains the extremely strong spin-charge coupling, relevant
energy scales, disappearence of pairing in the overdoped region, and the
contrasting spin-sensitivities of nodal and antinodal charges in HTSC systems.
Comparing collective versus single-particle excitations, pair formation versus

and transport properties of graphene. On the one hand, point defects induce a
finite elastic lifetime at low energies with the enhancement of the electronic
density of states close to the Fermi level. Localized disorder leads to a
universal, disorder independent, electrical conductivity at low temperatures,
of the order of the quantum of conductance. The static conductivity increases
with temperature and shows oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field.
The graphene magnetic susceptibility is temperature dependent (unlike an
ordinary metal) and also increases with the amount of defects. Optical
transport properties are also calculated in detail. On the other hand, extended
defects induce localized states near the Fermi level. In the absence of
electron-hole symmetry, these states lead to a transfer of charge between the
defects and the bulk, the phenomenon we call self-doping. The role of
electron-electron interactions in controlling self-doping is also analyzed. We

assimilates the conformal analysis of gravitational degrees of freedom. The
work is motivated by the problem of time in quantum gravity and is carried out
at the metric and the triad levels. At the metric level, it is shown that by
extending the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) phase space of general relativity
(GR), a conformal form of geometrodynamics can be constructed. In addition to
the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints, an extra first class constraint
is introduced to generate conformal transformations. This phase space consists
of York's mean extrinsic curvature time, conformal three-metric and their
momenta. At the triad level, the phase space of GR is further enlarged by
incorporating spin-gauge as well as conformal symmetries. This leads to a
canonical formulation of GR using a new set of real spin connection variables.
The resulting gravitational constraints are first class, consisting of the
Hamiltonian constraint and the canonical generators for spin-gauge and
conformorphism transformations. The formulation has a remarkable feature of
being parameter-free. Indeed, it is shown that a conformal parameter of the
Barbero-Immirzi type can be absorbed by the conformal symmetry of the extended
phase space. This gives rise to an alternative approach to loop quantum gravity
that addresses both the conceptual problem of time and the technical problem of
functional calculus in quantum gravity.

le ading to a relatively large uncertainty in $\vec d_N$. It is shown, using
quenched configurations, that a better sampling of the charge d istribution
reduces this problem, but because the CP even part of the fermion determinant
is absent, both the topological charge dis tribution and $\vec d_N$ are

If leptogenesis occurs at lower temperatures, electroweak sphalerons partially
transfer the lepton asymmetry to a baryonic one, while Yukawa interactions and
QCD sphalerons partially transfer the asymmetries of the left-handed fields to
the right-handed ones, suppressing the washout processes. Depending on the

show a puzzling pattern. We explore this ""$B\to\pi K$ puzzle"" through a

unitarity triangle through the CP-violating $B^0_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$,
$B^0_d\to\pi^-K^+$ asymmetries, yielding $\gamma=(73.9^{+5.8}_{-6.5})^\circ$,
and the extraction of hadronic parameters through the measured $B\to\pi\pi$
branching ratios. Using arguments related to the SU(3) flavour symmetry, we
convert the hadronic $B\to\pi\pi$ parameters into their $B\to\pi K$
counterparts, allowing us to predict the $B\to\pi K$ observables in the
Standard Model. We find agreement with the data for those quantities that are
only marginally affected by electroweak penguins, while this is not the case
for the observables with sizeable electroweak penguin contributions. Since we
may also perform a couple of internal consistency checks of our working
assumptions, which are nicely satisfied for the current data, and find a small
sensitivity of our results to large non-factorizable SU(3)-breaking
corrections, the ""$B\to\pi K$"" puzzle may be due to new physics in the
electroweak penguin sector. We show that it can indeed be resolved through such
a kind of new physics with a large CP-violating phase. Further insights into
the electroweak penguins are provided by the $B^+\to\pi^0K^+$ and
$B_d^0\to\pi^0K_{\rm S}$ CP asymmetries, and in particular through correlations

using the approach unifying all the internal degrees of freedom, proposed by
one of us. Spinors, living in d(=1+13)-dimensional space, carry in this
approach only the spin and interact with only the gravity through vielbeins and
two kinds of the spin connection fields - the gauge fields of the Poincare
group and the second kind of the Clifford algebra objects. All the quarks and
the leptons of one family appear in one Weyl representation of a chosen
handedness of the Lorentz group, if analyzed with respect to the Standard model
gauge groups: the right handed (with respect to SO(1,3)) weak chargeless quarks
and leptons and the left handed weak charged quark and leptons. A part of the
starting Lagrange density of a Weyl spinor in d=1+13 transforms right handed
quarks and leptons into left handed quarks and leptons manifesting as the
Yukawa couplings of the Standard model. The second kind of Clifford algebra
objects generates families and contributes to diagonal and off diagonal Yukawa
couplings. The approach predicts an even number of families, treating leptons
and quarks equivalently. In this paper we investigate within this approach the
appearance of the Yukawa couplings within one family of quarks and leptons as
well as among the families (without assuming any Higgs fields). We present the
mass matrices for four families and investigate whether our way of generating
families might explain the origin of families of quarks and leptons as well as
their observed properties - the masses and the mixing matrices. Numerical
results are presented in the paper following this one.

particles with a black body energy spectrum. The original calculation lead to
the conclusion that about the 90% of the black hole mass is radiated away in
the form of photons, neutrinos and light leptons, mainly electrons and muons.
With the advent of String Theory, such a scenario must be updated by including
new effects coming from the stringy nature of particles and interactions.By
taking for granted that black holes can be produced in hadronic collisions,
then their decay must take into account that: (i) we live in a D3-Brane
embedded into an higher dimensional bulk spacetime; (ii) fundamental
interactions, including gravity, are unified at TeV energy scale. Thus, the
formal description of the Hawking radiation mechanism has to be extended to the
case of more than four spacetime dimensions and include the presence of
D-branes. Furthermore, unification of fundamental interactions at an energy
scale many order of magnitude lower than the Planck energy implies that any
kind of fundamental particle, not only leptons, is expected to be emitted. A
detailed understanding of the new scenario is instrumental for optimal tuning
of detectors at future colliders, where, hopefully, this exciting new physics
will be tested. In this article we review higher dimensional black hole decay,
considering not only the emission of particles according to Hawking mechanism,
but also their near horizon QED/QCD interactions. The ultimate motivation is to
build up a phenomenologically reliable scenario, allowing a clear experimental
signature of the event.

preserve only N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions. As is well-known,
worldsheet or brane instantons in such a background can sometimes contribute to
an effective superpotential for the moduli of the compactification. We
generalize this phenomenon by showing that such instantons can also contribute
to new multi-fermion and higher-derivative F-terms in the low-energy effective
action. We consider in most detail the example of heterotic compactification on
a Calabi-Yau threefold X with gauge bundle V, in which case we study worldsheet
instanton effects that deform the complex structure of the moduli space
associated to X and V. We also give new, slightly more economical derivations
of some previous results about worldsheet instantons in Type IIA Calabi-Yau
compactifications.

formulated and the standard-like model with the symmetry ${\text{U}(3_c\otimes
2\otimes 1_{\text{\scriptsize$Y$}})\ast}$ is reconstructed based on it.
$\text{U}(n+m)\ast$ gauge group reduces to $\text{U}(n+m)$ on the commutative
spacetime which is not ${\text{U}}(N), (N=n+m)$ but isomorphic to
$\text{SU}(n)\times\text{SU}(m)\times \text{U}(1)$ in this article. On the
noncommutative spacetime, the representation that fields belong to is
fundamental, adjoint or bi-fundamental. For this reason, one had to construct
the standard model by use of bi-fundamental representations. However, we can
reconstruct the standard-like model with only fundamental and adjoint
representation and without using bi-fundamental representations. It is well
known that the charge of fermion is 0 or $\pm1$ in the U(1) gauge theory on
noncommutative spacetime. Thus, there may be no room to incorporate the
noncommutative U(1) gauge theory into the standard model because the quarks
have fractional charges. However, it is shown in this article that there is the
noncommutative gauge theory with arbitrary charges which symmetry is for
example $\text{U}(3\otimes 1)\ast$. This type of gauge theory emerges from the
spontaneous breakdown of the noncommutative U(4)$\ast$ gauge theory in which
the gauge field contains the 0 component $A_\mu^0(x,\theta)$. The standard-like
model in this paper also has fermion fields with fractional charges. Thus, the
noncommutative gauge theory with fractional U(1) charges can not exist alone,
but it must coexist with noncommutative nonabelian gauge theory.

  Analysis",,,,"math.PR",,"  Various Poincare-Sobolev type inequalities are studied for a
reaction-diffusion model of particle systems on Polish spaces. The systems we
consider consist of finite particles which are killed or produced at certain
rates, while particles in the system move on the Polish space interacting with
one another (i.e. diffusion). Thus, the corresponding Dirichlet form, which we
call reaction-diffusion Dirichlet form, consists of two parts: the diffusion
part induced by certain Markov processes on the product spaces $E^n (n \geq 1)$
which determine the motion of particles, and the reaction part induced by a
$Q$-process on $\mathbb Z_+$ and a sequence of reference probability measures,
where the $Q$-process determines the variation of the number of particles and
the reference measures describe the locations of newly produced particles. We
prove that the validity of Poincare and weak Poincare inequalities are
essentially due to the pure reaction part, i.e. either of these inequalities
holds if and only if it holds for the pure reaction Dirichlet form, or
equivalently, for the corresponding $Q$-process. But under a mild condition,
stronger inequalities rely on both parts: the reaction-diffusion Dirichlet form
satisfies a super Poincare inequality (e.g. the log-Sobolev inequality) if and
only if so do both the corresponding $Q$-process and the diffusion part.
Explicit estimates of constants in the inequalities are derived. Finally, some
specific examples are presented to illustrate the main results.

Exploiting this fact, we point out that systems which involve spherical nuclei
require the diffuseness parameter of around 0.60 fm in order to fit the
experimental data, while systems with a deformed target between 0.8 fm and 1.1
fm.

Rayleigh-fading channels with $N$ inputs (transmitters) and $M$ outputs
(receivers).
  The main issues addressed are the condition of statistical stability, the
rate of information transfer and the effect of pinholes. The stability
condition is proved to be
  $MC\ll N_{\rm eff}B$ for broadband channels and
  $M\ll N_{\rm eff}$ for narrowband channels where $C$ is the symbol rate,
  $B$ is the bandwidth and $N_{\rm eff}$ is the {\em effective} number (maybe
less than 1) of transmitters. It is shown that when the number of screens,
$n-1$, is relatively low compared to the logarithm of numbers of pinholes
$N_{\rm eff}$ is given by the {\em harmonic} (or {\em inverse}) {\em sum} of
the number of transmitters and the numbers of pinholes at all screens.
  The novel idea of the effective number of time reversal array (TRA) elements
is introduced to derive the stability condition and estimate the channel
capacity in the presence of multi-screen pinholes. The information rate, under
the constraints of the noise power $\nu$ per unit frequency and the average
total power $P$, attains the supremum $P/\nu$ in the regime $M\wedge N_{\rm
eff}\gg P/(\nu B)$. In particular, when $N_{\rm eff}\gg M\gg P/(B\nu)$ the
optimal information rate can be achieved with statistically stable, sharply
focused signals.

AdS/CFT duality, the dS/bulk duality, and gravity. The digital code for the
space structure consists of 1 and 0 for attachment space and detachment space,
respectively. Attachment space attaches to object permanently at zero speed or
reversibly at the speed of light. Detachment space detaches from the object
irreversibly at the speed of light. The combination of attachment space and
detachment space results in miscible space, binary lattice space or binary
partition space. Miscible space represents special relativity. Binary lattice
space consists of multiple quantized units of attachment space separated from
one another by detachment space. Binary lattice space corresponds to the
nilpotent universal computational rewrite system (NUCRS) by Diaz and Rowlands.
The gauge force fields and wavefunction are in binary lattice space. With

  Radiat. Prot. Dosim",,,,"physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM",,"  Although DNA damage is widely viewed as a critical target for the induction
of cell killing by ionizing radiation, the exact nature of DNA damage
responsible for these effects is unknown. To address this issue, the
probability of forming lethal damage by single proton tracks, derived from
published survival data for Chinese hamster V79 cells irradiated by protons
with energies from 0.57 to 5.01 MeV, has been compared to estimated yields of
clustered DNA lesions and repair outcomes calculated with Monte Carlo models.
The reported studies provide new information about the potential relationship
between the induction and repair of clustered DNA damage and trends in the
expected number of lethal events for protons with increasing linear energy
transfer (LET). A good correlation was found between the number of lethal
events in V79 cells and the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) consisting
of 3 or more elementary DNA lesions. For the yields of other types of DNA
damage, as well as point mutations formed through the misrepair of base damage
and single-strand breaks, observed trends with increasing LET are not
consistent with trends in the yields of lethal events. This observation
suggests that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of protons of varying
quality may be more closely related to the induction of complex DSBs rather
than other forms of damage.

in a cooperative manner is studied theoretically. The transport properties
depend primarily on the maximal number, $N$, of motor molecules that may pull
simultaneously on the cargo particle. Since each motor must unbind from the
filament after a finite number of steps but can also rebind to it again, the
actual number of pulling motors is not constant but varies with time between
zero and $N$. An increase in the maximal number $N$ leads to a strong increase
of the average walking distance (or run length) of the cargo particle. If the
cargo is pulled by up to $N$ kinesin motors, e.g., the walking distance is
estimated to be $5^{N-1}/N$ micrometers which implies that seven or eight
kinesin molecules are sufficient to attain an average walking distance in the
centimeter range. If the cargo particle is pulled against an external load
force, this force is shared between the motors which provides a nontrivial
motor-motor coupling and a generic mechanism for nonlinear force-velocity
relationships. With increasing load force, the probability distribution of the
instantenous velocity is shifted towards smaller values, becomes broader, and
develops several peaks. Our theory is consistent with available experimental
data and makes quantitative predictions that are accessible to systematic in
vitro experiments.
