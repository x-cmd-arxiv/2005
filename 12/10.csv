simple, non-parametric model which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to
the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (V_max) by preserving the
observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulations
with observed galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the use of the
maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, V_max,acc, for subhalos,
the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for
subhalos in dissipationless simulations, V_max,acc reflects the luminosity and
stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at
the epoch of observation, V_max,now. The simulations and our model L-V_max
relation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the
two-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy
clustering in the SDSS data at z~0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z~1 over the
entire probed range of projected separations, 0.1<r_p/(Mpc/h)<10.0. In
particular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from the
power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2 luminosity-selected samples is reproduced
very well. At z~3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape and
amplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of Lyman-break galaxies

more extended, steeper spectrum mini-halo. B2151+174 is unusual in a number of
important aspects: i) it is one of the most compact and flat spectrum sources
in a cluster core known; ii) it shows a complex, compact twin-jet structure in
a north-south orientation; iii) the orientation of the jets is 45deg misaligned
with apparent structure (ionization cones and dust disk) of the host galaxy on
larger scales. Since the twin-jet of the MSO has its northern half with an
apparent `twist', it might be that precession of the central supermassive black
hole explains this misalignement.
  B2151+174 may be an example of the early stage (10^3-10^4 yrs duration) of a
`bubble' being blown into the ICM where the plasma has yet to expand.

for 2008. As an analog to ""Kepler-like"" photometric transit observations, we
obtained (spatially unresolved) radiometric observations with the ACRIM 3

irradiance (TSI). Contemporaneous high-resolution broadband imagery with NASA's
TRACE spacecraft provided, directly, measures of the stellar (solar)
astrophysical noise that can intrinsically limit such transit observations.
During the ~ 5.5 h transit, the planet's angular diameter was approximately
1/32 the solar diameter, thus covering ~ 0.1 of the stellar surface. With our
ACRIM 3 data, we measure temporal changes in TSI with a 1 sigma per sample
(unbinned) uncertainty of approximately 100 mW m^-2 (0.007%). A diminution in
TSI of ~ 1.4 W m^-2 (~ 0.1%, closely corresponding to the geometrically
occulted area of the photosphere) was measured at mid-transit compared with a
mean pre/post transit TSI of ~ 1365.9 W m^-2. These observations serve as a
surrogate to future photometric observations of ETPs such as Kepler will
deliver. Detailed analysis of the ToV, a rare event within our own solar
system, with time-resolved radiometry augmented with high-resolution imagery
provides a useful analogue for investigating the detectability and
characterization of ETPs from observations that are anticipated in the near

orbital period of 1161 days by far the longest of any known X-ray binary. The
orbit has a modest eccentricity of 0.10 with an orbital circularization time of
less than 10^6 years. The large mass function of the orbit significantly
restricts the mass of the M giant. Adopting a neutron-star mass of 1.35M(Sun),
the maximum mass of the M giant is 1.22M(Sun), making it the less massive star.
Derived abundances indicate a slightly subsolar metallicity. Carbon and
nitrogen are in the expected ratio resulting from the red-giant first dredge-up
phase. The lack of O-17 suggests that the M-giant has a mass less than
1.3M(Sun), consistent with our maximum mass. The red giant radius is 103R(Sun),
much smaller than the estimated Roche lobe radius. Thus, the mass loss of the
red giant is via a stellar wind. Although the M giant companion to the neutron
star has a mass similar to the late-type star in low-mass X-ray binaries, its
near-solar abundances and apparent runaway velocity are not fully consistent
with the properties of this class of stars.

a period of at least 8 years. Based on our radial velocity measurements
covering more than two cycles of the outer orbit, along with other

conditionally cubic-Gaussian acceleration statistics. This model captures the
effects of intermittency of dissipation on acceleration and the conditional
dependence of acceleration on pseudo-dissipation (which differs from that
predicted by the refined Kolmogorov (1962) hypotheses). Non-Gaussianity of the
conditional acceleration PDF is accounted for in terms of model nonlinearity.

  In this paper we characterize those {\it points} of Euclidean space that lie

computable extension of the analyst's traveling salesman theorem. Our extension
says that a point in Euclidean space lies on some computable curve of finite
length if and only if it is ``permitted'' by some computable ``Jones
constriction''. A Jones constriction here is an explicit assignment of a
rational cylinder to each of the above-mentioned tiles in such a way that, when
the radius of the cylinder corresponding to a tile is used in place of the
``width of $K$'' in each tile, the square beta sum is finite. A point is
permitted by a Jones constriction if it is contained in the cylinder assigned
to each tile containing the point. The main part of our proof is the
construction of a computable curve of finite length traversing all the points
permitted by a given Jones constriction. Our construction uses the main ideas

and their phenomenology. Little Higgs models incorporate a light composite
Higgs boson and remain perturbative until a scale of order 10 TeV, as required
by precision electroweak data. The collective symmetry breaking mechanism,
which forms the basis of Little Higgs models, is introduced. An explicit, fully
realistic implementation of this mechanism, the Littlest Higgs model, is then
discussed in some detail. Several other implementations, including simple group
models and models with T parity, are also reviewed. Precision electroweak
constraints on a variety of Little Higgs models are summarized. If a Little
Higgs model is realized in nature, the predicted new particles should be
observable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The expected signatures, as well
as the experimental sensitivities and the possible strategies for confirming
the Little Higgs origin of new particles, are discussed. Finally, several other
related topics are briefly reviewed, including the ultraviolet completions of
Little Higgs models, as well as the implications of these models for flavor
physics and cosmology.

study numerically the rate of equidistribution for a uniformly-hyperbolic

construct a codimension three, type two $h$-vector of socle degree $e$ such

of contributions from different scales of motion and different orders of
space-derivatives of velocity, a Multi-Scale Gradient (MSG) expansion. The
expansion is proved to converge to the exact stress, as a consequence of the
locality of cascade both in scale and in space. Simple estimates show, however,
that the convergence rate may be slow for the expansion in spatial gradients of
very small scales. Therefore, we develop an approximate expansion, based upon
an assumption that similar or `coherent' contributions to turbulent stress are
obtained from disjoint subgrid regions. This Coherent-Subregions Approximation
(CSA) yields an MSG expansion that can be proved to converge rapidly at all
scales and is hopefully still reasonably accurate. As an application, we
consider the cascades of energy and helicity in three-dimensional turbulence.
To first order in velocity-gradients, the stress has three contributions: a
tensile stress along principal directions of strain, a contractile stress along
vortex lines, and a shear stress proportional to `skew-strain.' While
vortex-stretching plays the major role in energy cascade, there is a second,
less scale-local contribution from `skew-strain'. For helicity cascade the
situation is reversed, and it arises scale-locally from `skew-strain' while the
stress along vortex-lines gives a secondary, less scale-local contribution.
These conclusions are illustrated with simple exact solutions of 3D Euler
equations. In the first, energy cascade occurs by Taylor's mechanism of
stretching and spin-up of small-scale vortices due to large-scale strain. In
the second, helicity cascade occurs by `twisting' of small-scale vortex
filaments due to a large-scale screw.

  Cascade","24 pages, 1 figure",,"10.1017/S0022112005007883",,"nlin.CD",,"  We develop a fundamental approach to a turbulent constitutive law for the 2D
inverse cascade, based upon a convergent multi-scale gradient (MSG) expansion.
To first order in gradients we find that the turbulent stress generated by
small-scale eddies is proportional not to strain but instead to `skew-strain,'
i.e. the strain tensor rotated by $45^\circ.$ The skew-strain from a given
scale of motion makes no contribution to energy flux across eddies at that
scale, so that the inverse cascade cannot be strongly scale-local. We show that
this conclusion extends a result of Kraichnan for spectral transfer and is due
to absence of vortex-stretching in 2D. This `weakly local' mechanism of inverse
cascade requires a relative rotation between the principal directions of strain
at different scales and we argue for this using both the dynamical equations of
motion and also a heuristic model of `thinning' of small-scale vortices by an
imposed large-scale strain. Carrying out our expansion to second-order in
gradients, we find two additional terms in the stress that can contribute to
energy cascade. The first is a Newtonian stress with an `eddy-viscosity' due to
differential strain-rotation, and the second is a tensile stress exerted along
vorticity contour-lines. The latter was anticipated by Kraichnan for a very
special model situation of small-scale vortex wave-packets in a uniform strain
field. We prove a proportionality in 2D between the mean rates of differential
strain-rotation and of vorticity-gradient stretching, analogous to a similar
relation of Betchov for 3D. According to this result the second-order stresses
will also contribute to inverse cascade when, as is plausible, vorticity
contour-lines lengthen on average by turbulent advection.

functional relation that provides long-term stability despite the wide
diversity of the fluctuations commence: emotions, economics, physical

its specification: the route to the long-term stability is through coherence
and boundedness as necessary conditions. It is demonstrated that the chaoticity
is the hallmark of that relationship. The present contribution is a systematic
study written as a book on the relation between long-term stability and
exerting macroscopic fluctuations. Further attention is focused on the
mechanism that guarantees the boundedness and the coherence of the local
fluctuations in the physical systems. Crucial arguments that neither of the
existing so far approaches to the behavior of the extended many-body systems

turns out that the mechanism that brings about macroscopic fluctuations has
universal properties and entangles quantum decoherence, chaos and 1/f noise in

contrast response curve is shifted to lower contrast values (Reynolds et al,
2000, Neuron 26:703). Attention also increases the coherence between neurons
responding to the same stimulus (Fries et al, 2001, Science 291:1560). We
studied how the firing rate and synchrony of a densely interconnected cortical
network varied with contrast and how they were modulated by attention. We found
that an increased driving current to the excitatory neurons increased the
overall firing rate of the network, whereas variation of the driving current to
inhibitory neurons modulated the synchrony of the network. We explain the
synchrony modulation in terms of a locking phenomenon during which the ratio of
excitatory to inhibitory firing rates is approximately constant for a range of
driving current values. We explored the hypothesis that contrast is represented
primarily as a drive to the excitatory neurons, whereas attention corresponds
to a reduction in driving current to the inhibitory neurons. Using this
hypothesis, the model reproduces the following experimental observations: (1)
the firing rate of the excitatory neurons increases with contrast; (2) for high
contrast stimuli, the firing rate saturates and the network synchronizes; (3)
attention shifts the contrast response curve to lower contrast values; (4)
attention leads to stronger synchronization that starts at a lower value of the
contrast compared with the attend-away condition. In addition, it predicts that
attention increases the delay between the inhibitory and excitatory synchronous
volleys produced by the network, allowing the stimulus to recruit more
downstream neurons.

kinetics are discussed. A functional response, which is a function of the ratio
of uninfected to infected tumor cells, is proposed to describe the spread of
the virus infection in the tumor. One of the main mathematical features of
ratio-dependent models is that the origin is a complicated equilibrium point
whose characteristics crucially determine the main properties of the model. It
is shown that, in a certain area of parameter values, the trajectories of the
model form a family of homoclinics to the origin (so-called elliptic sector).
Biologically, this means that both infected and uninfected tumor cells can be
eliminated with time, and complete recovery is possible as a result of the
virus therapy within the framework of deterministic models

  cells",,"Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 (2005) 208105","10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.208105",,"q-bio.QM",,"  A salient feature of stationary patterns in tip-growing cells is the key role
played by the symports and antiports, membrane proteins that translocate two
ionic species at the same time. It is shown that these co-transporters
destabilize generically the membrane voltage if the two translocated ions
diffuse differently and carry a charge of opposite (same) sign for symports
(antiports). Orders of magnitude obtained for the time and lengthscale are in
agreement with experiments. A weakly nonlinear analysis characterizes the
bifurcation.

constructed to assess correlations between the position and momentum of a
single free particle. These correlations give rise to position dependent phases
which develop dynamically and may play an important role in the interference
patterns. For large enough transverse coherence lenght such interference
patterns are noticeably different from those of a classical dispersion free
wave.

which depends on the form of the state. Surprisingly, this lower bound can be
very large. We derive the states which have the lowest possible uncertainty
product for a given uncertainty in the angle or in the angular momentum. We
show that, if the given angle uncertainty is close to its maximum value, the
lowest possible uncertainty product tends to infinity.
