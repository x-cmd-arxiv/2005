reveals the classic spectrum of a `disk maser', represented by three distinct

rotation velocity of the putative masing disk is well below 1000 km/s. Based on
the literature and archive data, X-ray absorbing column densities are compiled
for the 64 galaxies with reported maser sources beyond the Magellanic Clouds.
For NGC2782 and NGC5728, we present Chandra archive data that indicate the
presence of an active galactic nucleus in both galaxies. The correlation
between absorbing column and H_2O emission is analyzed. There is a striking
difference between kilo- and megamasers with megamasers being associated with
higher column densities. All kilomasers (L_H_2O < 10 L_sun) except NGC2273 and
NGC5194 are Compton-thin, i.e. their absorbing columns are < 10^24 cm^-2. Among
the H_2O megamasers, 50% arise from Compton-thick and 85% from heavily obscured
(> 10^23 cm^-2) active galactic nuclei. These values are not larger but
consistent with those from samples of Seyfert 2 galaxies not selected on the
basis of maser emission. The similarity in column densities can be explained by
small deviations in position between maser spots and nuclear X-ray source and a
high degree of clumpiness in the circumnuclear interstellar medium.

use the Ca II triplet as a benchmark to evaluate the utility of the other

extending from ~5050-5520 A, in combination with narrow coronal emission lines,
can seriously bias sigma* measurements from the Mgb region, highlighting the
need for extreme caution in its use. However, we argue that at luminosities
constituting a moderate fraction of the Eddington limit, when the Fe II lines
are both weak and smooth relative to the stellar lines, it is possible to
derive meaningful measurements with careful selection of the fitting region. In
particular, to avoid the contamination of coronal lines, we advocate the use of
the region 5250--5820 A, which is rich in Fe absorption features. We lay the

luminosity function and luminosity dependence of clustering are the same as
that observed, and in which the form of the luminosity-weighted correlation
function is entirely a consequence of the fact that massive halos populate
dense regions. We do this by using mock catalogs which are constrained to
reproduce the observed luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of
clustering, as well as by using the language of the redshift-space halo-model.
These analyses show that marked correlations may show a signal on large scales
even if there are no large-scale physical effects--the statistical correlation
between halos and their environment will produce a measureable signal. Our
model is in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the halo mass
function in dense regions is top-heavy; the correlation between halo mass and
large scale environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy
properties and environment; and the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halo
is different from (in general, brighter than) that of the other objects in the
halo. Thus our measurement provides strong evidence for the accuracy of these
three standard assumptions of galaxy formation models. These assumptions also
form the basis of current halo-model based interpretations of galaxy
clustering.

and [OII] equivalent widths, we distinguish star-forming from passive
populations in order to explore the nature of ""downsizing''--a pattern in which
the sites of active star formation shift from high mass galaxies at early times
to lower mass systems at later epochs. Over the redshift range probed, we
identify a mass limit, M_Q, above which star formation appears to be quenched.
The physical mechanisms responsible for downsizing can thus be empirically
quantified by charting the evolution in this threshold mass. We find that M_Q
decreases with time by a factor of ~3 across the redshift range sampled
according with a redshift dependence of (1+z)^3.5. To further constrain
possible quenching mechanisms, we investigate how this downsizing signal
depends on local galaxy environment. For the majority of galaxies in regions
near the median density, there is no significant correlation between downsizing
and environment. However, a trend is observed in the comparison between more
extreme environments that are more than 3 times overdense or underdense
relative to the median. Here, we find that downsizing is accelerated in
overdense regions which host higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies and
fewer late-types as compared to the underdense regions. Our results
significantly constrain recent suggestions for the origin of downsizing and
indicate that the process for quenching star formation must, primarily, be
internally driven. (Abridged)

notion of Hilbert C*-modules to nonselfadjoint algebras. We show that an
`ideal' of a general operator space X is the intersection of X with an `ideal'
in any containing C*-algebra or C*-module. Finally, we discuss the
noncommutative variant of the classical theory of `peak sets'.

transitions, a state population inversion can be achieved and preserved for the
two working levels of the SQC and, when needed, the SQC can generate a single
photon. We can regularly repeat these processes in each cycle when the
previously generated photon in the cavity is decaying, so that a periodic
sequence of single photons can be produced persistently. This provides a
controllable way for implementing a persistent single-photon source on a
microelectronic chip.

interacting with the electromagnetic field in the rotating wave approximation
(RWA), commonly used in the atom-radiation interaction. One of the three atoms
is initially excited, and the other two are in their ground state. We
numerically calculate the propagation of the field spontaneously emitted by the
excited atom and scattered by the second atom, as well as the excitation
probability of the second and third atom. The results obtained are analyzed
from the point of view of relativistic causality in the atom-field interaction.
We show that, when the RWA is used, relativistic causality is obtained only if
the integrations over the field frequencies are extended to $-\infty$; on the
contrary, noncausal tails remain even if the number of field modes is
increased. This clearly shows the limit of the RWA in dealing with subtle
problems such as relativistic causality in the atom-field interaction.
