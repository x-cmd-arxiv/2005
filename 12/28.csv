true vacuum state of all existing fields in the Universe, is the simplest and
the most natural possibility to describe the current cosmic acceleration.
However, despite its observational successes, such a possibility exacerbates
the well known $\Lambda$ problem, requiring a natural explanation for its
small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we discuss how different our Universe
may be from the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying observational aspects of a kind
of ""expansion"" around the vacuum given by the equation of (EOS)
$p_{d}=-\rho_{d} - A \rho_{d}^{\alpha}$. In different parameter regimes such a
parametrization is capable of describing both quintessence-like and
phantom-like dark energy, transient acceleration, and various (non)singular
possibilities for the final destiny of the Universe, including singularities at
finite values of the scale factor, the so-called ""Big Rip"", as well as sudden
future singularities. By using some of the most recent cosmological
observations we show that if the functional form of the dark energy EOS has
additional parameters very little can be said about their values from the
current observational results, which postpones, until the arrival of more
precise observational data, a definitive answer to the question posed above.

6334. The 3-10 keV and 10-35 keV images made with JEM-X show a complex
structure of extended emission from NGC 6334. The ISGRI source detected in the
energy ranges 20-40 keV and 40-80 keV coincides with the NGC 6334 ridge. The
20-60 keV flux from the source is (1.8+-0.37)*10(-11) erg cm(-2) s(-1).
Spectral analysis of the source revealed a hard power-law component with a
photon index about 1. The observed X-ray fluxes are in agreement with
extrapolations of X-ray imaging observations of NGC 6334 by Chandra ACIS and
ASCA GIS. The X-ray data are consistent with two very different physical
models. A probable scenario is emission from a heavily absorbed, compact and
hard Chandra source that is associated with the AGN candidate radio source NGC
6334B. Another possible model is the extended Chandra source of nonthermal
emission from NGC 6334 that can also account for the hard X-ray emission
observed by INTEGRAL. The origin of the emission in this scenario is due to
electron acceleration in energetic outflows from massive early type stars. The
possibility of emission from a young supernova remnant, as suggested by earlier
infrared observations of NGC 6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44Ti

observational coverage in the radio (University of Michigan Radio Astronomy

  At TeV energies, the observations revealed several flares at intermediate
flux levels, peaking between 1 and 1.5 times the flux from the Crab Nebula.
While the time averaged spectrum can be fitted with a single power law of
photon index Gamma =2.8, we find some evidence for spectral variability.
Confirming earlier results, the campaign reveals a rather loose correlation
between the X-ray and TeV gamma-ray fluxes. In one case, a very strong X-ray
flare is not accompanied by a comparable TeV gamma-ray flare. Although the
source flux was variable in the optical and radio bands, the sparse sampling of
the optical and radio light curves does not allow us to study the correlation
properties in detail.

potential modulation directions may be ignored is investigated. The
long-distance behaviour at the ordinary surface transition is mapped onto a
field theory with the boundary conditions that both the order parameter
$\bm{\phi}$ and its normal derivative $\partial_n\bm{\phi}$ vanish at the
surface plane. The boundary-operator expansion is utilized to study the
short-distance behaviour of $\bm{\phi}$ near the surface. Its leading
contribution is found to be controlled by the boundary operator
$\partial_n^2\bm{\phi}$. The field theory is renormalized for dimensions $d$
below the upper critical dimension $d^*(m)=4+m/2$, with a corresponding surface
source term $\propto \partial_n^2\bm{\phi}$ added. The anomalous dimension of
this boundary operator is computed to first order in $\epsilon=d^*-d$. The
result is used in conjunction with scaling laws to estimate the value of the
single independent surface critical exponent
$\beta_{\mathrm{L}1}^{(\mathrm{ord},\perp)}$ for $d=3$. Our estimate for the
case $m=n=1$ of a uniaxial Lifshitz point in Ising systems is in reasonable
agreement with published Monte Carlo results.

solution has asymptotic flatness properties and is reduced to Voorhees's one in

of the conformal transformation such that their results are independent of
details of scalar-tensor theories. For some specific cases, we analytically
obtain a deflection angle of the light path and find that it can become
negative. The appearance of a negative deflection angle indicates
``reflection'' of a light path, and we investigate under which conditions the
light reflection occurs. As for the optical scalars, the Weyl source-term shows
significantly different properties compared with that in the Schwarzschild
spacetime. We therefore classify a space of the model parameters into four
distinct regions on the basis of the qualitative properties of the Weyl
source-term and find a close relationship between this classification and the
occurrence of the light reflection. We finally solve the null geodesic
equations and the optical scalar equations numerically. We find that a picture
of the thin lens is applicable and give a simple analytic model for the optical
scalars. As for the properties of gravitational lensing, the deflection angle
and the image distortion rate are obtained as functions of the impact
parameter. Again, we find a close relationship between their qualitative

of $B-L$ cosmic strings can produce heavy right handed neutrinos, $N_R$'s,
whose CP-asymmetric decay in out-of-thermal equilibrium condition can give rise
to a net lepton ($L$) asymmetry which is then converted, due to sphaleron
transitions, to a Baryon ($B$) asymmetry. This is studied by using the relevant
Boltzmann equations and including the effects of both thermal and string
generated non-thermal $N_R$'s. We explore the parameter region spanned by the
effective light neutrino mass parameter $\tilde{m}_1$, the mass $M_1$ of the
lightest of the heavy right-handed neutrinos (or equivalently the Yukawa
coupling $h_1$) and the scale of $B-L$ symmetry breaking, $\eta_{B-L}$, and
show that there exist ranges of values of these parameters, in particular with
$\eta_{B-L} > 10^{11}\gev$ and $h_1\gsim 0.01$, for which the cosmic string

produce, the observed Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe when the purely thermal
leptogenesis mechanism is not sufficient. We also discuss how, depending on the

modular form on $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ of weight $2k$. We explore number theoretic
properties of this form and find a sufficient condition for its vanishing which
yields modular identities (e.g., Ramanujan-Watson's modular identities).
Furthermore, we focus on a family of modular invariant spaces coming from
suitable two-dimensional spaces via the symmetric power construction. In
particular, we consider a two-dimensional space spanned by graded dimensions of
certain level one modules for the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra of type
$D_4^{(1)}$. In this case, the reduction modulo prime $p=2k+3 \geq 5$ of the
modular form associated to the $k$-th symmetric power classifies supersingular
elliptic curves in characteristic $p$. This construction also gives a new
interpretation of certain modular forms studied by Kaneko and Zagier.

of $n$ alternating white and black pegs on a one-dimensional board consisting
of an unlimited number of empty holes, rearrange the pegs into a string
consisting of $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ white pegs followed immediately by
$\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ black pegs (or vice versa) using only moves which
take 2 adjacent pegs to 2 vacant adjacent holes. Avis and Deza proved that the
alternating string can be sorted in $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ such {\em Berge
2-moves} for $n\geq 5$. Extending Berge's original problem, we consider the
same sorting problem using {\em Berge $k$-moves}, i.e., moves which take $k$
adjacent pegs to $k$ vacant adjacent holes. We prove that the alternating
string can be sorted in $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ Berge 3-moves for
$n\not\equiv 0\pmod{4}$ and in $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil+1$ Berge 3-moves for

$\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ Berge $k$-moves. This estimate is tight as
$\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$ is a lower bound for the minimum number of required

feature of allowing the sort of general abstraction or comprehension principle
that infamously leads to paradox in naive set theory. Because type-free systems
possess these features, and avoid the hierarchy of types that is felt to be
unnatural in some contexts, they have the potential to play an important role
in the foundations of mathematics, the theory of classes (producing a richer
notion of class than that currently used in set theory and category theory),
property theory, natural language semantics, the theory of truth, and
theoretical computer science. Clearly, type-free systems must depart from
classical logic in some way, but there is little agreement on what kind of
type-free system to use, and which departures from classical logic should be
allowed.
  Our approach to type-free logic is to study a naturally occurring type-free
system that we believe is in some sense prototypical of systems that will
ultimately prove useful. The logic studied in this paper, called algorithmic
logic, concerns certain basic statements involving algorithms and the
algorithmic rules of inference between such statements. This paper studies the
propositional properties of algorithmic logic. A future paper will show that
algorithmic logic possesses a general abstraction principle.

standards. For the quadrupole moments, agreement is obtained to within about
10~% with the available measurements. For the hyperfine constants, good
agreement is obtained with measurements and with other calculations, except for
the $A$ factors of the $^2D_{5/2}$ states of Sr$^+$, Ba$^+$, and Yb$^+$, where
the correlation effects are so large that they reverse the sign of the constant
relative to the Dirac-Hartree-Fock value. As a test of the Hg$^+$ calculational
methods, quadrupole moments and hyperfine constants are calculated for the
$5d^9 6s^2 ^2 D_{3/2, 5/2}$ states in isoelectronic neutral Au. This yields a
new value of the nuclear quadrupole moment $Q$($^{197}$Au) = +0.587(29) b.

the dissociation energy for the carbon monoxide molecule. Our outcomes are more
accurate than the standard models used to study molecular vibrations, namely
the Morse and the $q$-oscillator models and comparable to the perturbed Morse
model proposed by Huffaker \cite{hf}, for the first experimental levels. The
dissociation energy obtained here is more accurate than all previous models.

Darwinian dynamics. We first show that how the nonequilibrium statistical
mechanics emerges naturally. We then show that the first three laws of the
thermodynamics, the Zeroth Law, the First Law and the Second Law can be
followed from the Darwinian dynamics, except the Third Law. The inability to
derive the Third Law indicates that the Darwinian dynamics belongs to the
""classical"" domain. Specifically, the Second Law is proved from the dynamical
point of view. Two types of current dynamical equalities are explicitly
discussed in the paper: one is based on Feynman-Kac formula and one is a
generalization of the Einstein relation. Both are directly accessible to
experimental tests. Our demonstration indicates that the Darwinian dynamics is
logically a simple and straightforward starting point to get into
thermodynamics and is complementary to the conservative dynamics dominated in
physics.

Evolutionary
game theory has been the standard framework to address this issue. In most
models, every individual plays with all others, and then reproduce and die
according to what they earn. This amounts to assuming that selection takes
place at a slow pace with respect to the interaction time scale. We show that,
quite generally, if selection speeds up, the evolution outcome changes
dramatically. Thus, in games such as Harmony, where cooperation is the only
equilibrium and the only rational outcome, rapid selection leads to dominance
of defectors. Similar non trivial phenomena arise in other binary games and
even in more complicated settings such as the Ultimatum game. We conclude that
the rate of selection is a key element to understand and model the emergence of
cooperation, and one that has so far been overlooked.

  We here consider an auxiliary rule-set called the nRules that triggers a
non-unitary mechanism that applies to all macroscopic measurements, as well as
to many microscopic processes including shelving. These rules are shown below
to describe the shelving process in complete detail without resorting to the
notion of null measurement, or to an external measurement of any kind. They
