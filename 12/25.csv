metric embedded in a background FRW universe, in which the observer could be
located anywhere. Within the exact general relativistic formulation, the
junction conditions for the only possible matching without a thin shell at the

way that the luminosity distance-red shift relation mimics a FRW universe with
dark energy. Therefore, the dimming of SNIa is accounted for in such a {\it
structured} FRW universe. We have also calculated the exact general
relativistic backreaction term and shown how it influences the global Hubble
parameter and the effective density of the cosmic fluid By using an exact
formulation of the general relativistic dynamics of structures in a homogeneous

perturbations leads to an apparent dimming of the cosmological distances.

magnetoexcitons in coupled quantum wells (CQW) and unbalanced two-layer
electron system in high magnetic field $H$ is considered in the presence of a
random field. The problem of the rare gas of magnetoexcitons with dipole-dipole

dipole excitons without magnetic field with the effective magnetic mass of a
magnetoexciton, which is a function of the magnetic field and parameters of the
CQW, in an $H$-dependent effective random field.
  The density of the superfluid component $n_{s}$ and the temperature $T_{c}$
of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a superfluid state are obtained as
functions of magnetic field $H$, interlayer separation $D$ and the random field
parameters $\alpha_{i}$ and $g_{i}$. For 2D magnetoexcitonic systems, the rise
of the magnetic field $H$ and the interwell distance $D$ is found to increase
the effective renormalized random field parameter $Q$ and suppress the
superfluid density $n_s$ and the temperature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition $T_c$. The suppressing influence of $D$ on $n_s$ and $T_c$ in strong
magnetic filed is opposite to the case without magnetic field, when $n_s$ and
$T_c$ increase with the rise of $D$ at fixed total exciton density $n$. It is
shown that in the presence of the disorder at sufficiently large magnetic field

Hele-Shaw cell. Combining analytical and numerical solutions, we describe the
emergence of a self-similar dumbbell shape and find non-trivial dynamic
exponents that characterize scaling behavior of the dumbbell dimensions.

Vol. 26, No. 9 (2009) 090601",,,"physics.atom-ph physics.optics",,"  A microwave atomic clock scheme based on Rb and Cs atoms trapped in optical
lattice with magic wavelength for clock transition is proposed. The ac Stark
shift of clock transition due to trapping laser can be canceled at some
specific laser wavelengths. Comparing with in fountain clock, the cavity
related shifts, the collision shift, and the Doppler effect are eliminated or
suppressed dramatically in atomic clock when the magic optical lattice is
exploited. By carefully analyzing various sources of clock uncertainty, we
conclude that a microwave atomic clock with an accuracy of better than
$2\times10^{-17}$ is feasible, which is of the same accuracy as the expected
best optical atomic clock.

limit. The mechanism is demonstrated for the kinetic Monte-Carlo version of the
Schnakenberg reaction where we identified a scaling limit in which the global
deterministic bifurcation picture is fundamentally altered by fluctuations.
Numerical simulations of the model are found to be in quantitative agreement
with theoretical predictions.

boson creation and annihilation operators. The fermion-antifermion operators
generate a unitary Lie algebra, whose representations are fixed by a first
order Casimir operator (corresponding to baryon number or charge). Eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of the four-momentum operator are analyzed and exact solutions
in the strong coupling limit are sketched. A simple model shows how the fine
