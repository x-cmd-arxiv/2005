the simulation kit GEANT4, we calculate proton cooling efficiency including
pion-multiplicity and proton-inelasticity in photomeson production. First, we
estimate the maximum energy of accelerated protons in GRBs. Using the obtained
results, neutrino flux from one burst and a diffuse neutrino background are
evaluated quantitatively. We also take account of cooling processes of pion and
muon, which are crucial for resulting neutrino spectra. We confirm the validity
of analytic approximate treatments on GRB fiducial parameter sets, but also
find that the effects of multiplicity and high-inelasticity can be important on
both proton cooling and resulting spectra in some cases. Finally, assuming that
the GRB rate traces the star formation rate, we obtain a diffuse neutrino
background spectrum from GRBs for specific parameter sets. We introduce the
nonthermal baryon-loading factor, rather than assume that GRBs are main sources
of UHECRs. We find that the obtained neutrino background can be comparable with
the prediction of Waxman & Bahcall, although our ground in estimation is
different from theirs. In this paper, we study on various parameters since
there are many parameters in the model. The detection of high energy neutrinos
from GRBs will be one of the strong evidences that protons are accelerated to
very high energy in GRBs. Furthermore, the observations of a neutrino
background has a possibility not only to test the internal shock model of GRBs
but also to give us information about parameters in the model and whether GRBs
are sources of UHECRs or not.

The protostellar outflow-driven turbulence (``protostellar turbulence'' for
short) can keep the region close to a virial equilibrium long after the initial
turbulence has decayed away. We argue that there exist two types of turbulence
in star-forming clouds: a primordial (or ``interstellar'') turbulence and a
protostellar turbulence, with the former transformed into the latter mostly in
embedded clusters such as NGC 1333. Since the majority of stars are thought to
form in clusters, an implication is that the stellar initial mass function is
determined to a large extent by the stars themselves, through outflows which
individually limit the mass accretion onto forming stars and collectively shape
the environments (density structure and velocity field) in which most cluster
members form. We speculate that massive cluster-forming clumps supported by
protostellar turbulence gradually evolve towards a highly centrally condensed
``pivotal'' state, culminating in rapid formation of massive stars in the
densest part through accretion.

optical afterglow light curves in the rest frame (t'_b) are used. By
considering this method we constrain the cosmological parameters and the
redshift at which the universe expanded from the deceleration to acceleration
phase. We add five recently-detected GRBs to the sample and derive E_{\gamma,

bursts and the efficiency of conversion of the explosion energy to gamma-ray
energy that are difficult to measure. We regard the E_{\gamma,iso}(E'_p, t'_b)
relationship as a standard candle and find 0.05<\Omega_M<0.48 and
\Omega_\Lambda<1.15 (at the 1\sigma confidence level). In a flat universe with

detected in a high-resolution optical spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 051111

FeII****, as well as SiII*, are confined to a narrow velocity structure
extending over +/-30 km/s, which we interpret as the burst local environment,
most likely a star forming region. We investigate two scenarios for the
excitation of the fine-structure levels by collisions with electrons and
radiative pumping by an infra-red or ultra-violet radiation field produced by
intense star formation in the GRB environment, or by the GRB afterglow itself.
We find that the conditions required for collisional excitation of FeII
fine-structure states cannot be easily reconciled with the relatively weak
SiII* absorption. Radiative pumping by either IR or UV emission requires >10^3
massive hot OB stars within a compact star-forming region a few pc in size, and
in the case of IR pumping a large dust content. On the other hand, it is
possible that the GRB itself provides the source of IR and/or UV radiation, in
which case we estimate that the excitation takes place at a distance of ~10-20
pc from the burst. Detailed radiative transfer calculations are required in
order to verify that excitation of the low-ionization fine-structure states is
possible given the intense UV flux from the burst. Still, it is clear that GRB
absorption spectroscopy can provide direct information on the mode and
conditions of star formation at high redshift.

and kinematic properties of Cold Dark Matter haloes forming in cosmological
simulations. Our approach involves generating a single realisation of the
initial power spectrum of density perturbations and studying how truncation of
this power spectrum on scales larger than L_cut affects the structure of dark
matter haloes at z=0. In particular, we have examined the cases of L_cut =
f_cut L_box with f_cut=1 (i.e. no truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with
previous studies, we find that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations
reduces the strength of clustering, as measured by a suppression of the 2-point
correlation function xi(r), and reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes,
as reflected in the depletion of the high mass end of the mass function n(M).
Interestingly, we find that truncation has little impact on the internal
properties of haloes. The masses of high mass haloes decrease in a systematic
manner as L_cut is reduced, but the distribution of concentrations is
unaffected. On the other hand, the median spin parameter is ~50% lower in runs
with f_cut<1. We argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth phase of
the halo's angular momentum by tidal torquing, and that the absence of any
measurable trend in concentration and the weak trend observed in halo shape
reflect the importance of virialisation and complex mass accretion histories
for these quantities. These results are of interest for studies that require
high mass resolution and statistical samples of simulated haloes, such as
simulations of the population of first stars. Our analysis shows that
large-scale tidal fields have relatively little effect on the internal
properties of Cold Dark Matter haloes and hence may be ignored in such studies.

Since then the mean optical brightness of the system is in steady decline,
reaching only in the last few years its pre-outburst value. Superposed on this
general decline are some 6 less intense outbursts of 1-2 magnitude and duration
of 2000-5000 days. We find a cycle of ~6376 days, or possibly twice this
period, in the occurrence of these outbursts. We suggest that the origin of the
system outbursts is in some magnetic cycle in the outer layers of the giant
star of the system, akin to the less intense ~8000 days magnetic cycle of our
Sun. We further find, that in addition to its well known binary period of 757.3
days, BF Cyg possesses also another photometric period of 798.8 days. This
could be the rotation period of the giant star of the system. If it is, the
beat period of these two periodicities, 14580 days, is the rotation period of a
tidal wave on the surface of the giant. A 4th period of 4436 days, the beat
period of the 14580 and the 6376 cycles is possibly also present in the LC. We
predict that BF Cyg will be at the peak of its next outburst around the month
of May in the year 2007. The newly discovered 798.8 days period explains the
disappearance of the orbital modulation at some epochs in the light curve. The
757.3 oscillations will be damped again around the year 2013.

branch (similar to the horizontal branch of Z sources) is characterised by a
low-amplitude change of the hard colour compared to the change in the soft
colour. In the soft branch (analogue to the normal branch) the amplitude of
variability of the hard colour is about three times larger than that of the
soft colour. As the count rate decreases the source moves up gradually through
the soft to the hard branch. The aperiodic variability (excluding the pulse
noise) consists of band-limited noise (represented by three broad Lorentzian
components) and two QPOs at 0.05 Hz and 0.22 Hz. The strength of the lower
frequency QPO increases as the source approaches the hard branch (similar to
HBOs in Z sources). The higher frequency QPO reaches maximum significance when
the source is in the middle of the branch (like NBOs). We have performed the
first measurements of phase lags in the band limited noise below 8 Hz in an
accreting X-ray pulsar and found that soft lags dominate at high frequencies.
Above the pulse frequency (0.23 Hz), the amplitude of the lag increases as the
X-ray flux increases. The Z topology appears to be a signature of the neutron
star binaries as it is present in all types of neutron-star binaries (Z, atoll
and, as we show here, in accreting pulsars as well). However, the motion along

a fair extrapolation to Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP)
frequencies and an estimate of the contamination by Galactic synchrotron
emission. We extrapolate the E-mode spectrum up to 32-GHz and confirm the
possibility to safely detect the CMBP E-mode signal in the Ka band found in
another low emission region (Carretti et al. 2005b). Extrapolated up to 90-GHz,
the Galactic synchrotron B-mode looks to compete with the cosmic signal only
for models with a tensor-to-scalar perturbation power ratio T/S < 0.001, which
is even lower than the T/S value of 0.01 found to be accessible in the only
other high Galactic latitude area investigated to date. This suggests that
values as low as T/S = 0.01 might be accessed at high Galactic latitudes. Such
low emission values can allow a significant red-shift of the best frequency to
detect the CMBP B-mode, also reducing the contamination by Galactic dust, and
opening interesting perspectives to investigate Inflation models.

models, enabling those variations which could be attributed to interstellar

Thin-screen scattering models do not account for the variability amplitude on

Scuti Pre-Main-Sequence star IP Per. Nine telescopes have been involved in the
observations, with a total of about 190 hours of observations over 38 nights.
Present data confirms the multiperiodic nature of this star and leads to the
identification of at least nine pulsational frequencies. Comparison with the
predictions of linear non-adiabatic radial pulsation models allowed us to
identify only five of the nine observed frequencies, and to constrain the
position of IP Per in the HR diagram. The latter is in good agreement with the
empirical determination of the stellar parameters obtained by Miroshnichenko et
al. (2001). An initial interpretation of the observed frequencies using the
Aarhus non-radial pulsation code suggests that three frequencies could be
associated with non-radial ($l$=2) modes. Finally, we present new evolutionary
and pulsation models at lower metallicity (Z=0.008) to take into account the
possibility that IP Per is metal deficient, as indicated by Miroshnichenko et
al. (2001).

contradictory results obtained using different abundance indicators. To achieve
a better understanding of the problem we have acquired high quality spectra
with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at VLT, with a
signal-to-noise of the order of 100 in the near ultraviolet and 500 in the
optical and near infrared wavelength range. Three different oxygen abundance
indicators, OH ultraviolet lines around 310.0 nm, the [OI] line at 630.03 nm
and the OI lines at 777.1-5 nm were observed in the spectra of 13 metal-poor
subgiants with -3.0<=[Fe/H]<=-1.5. Oxygen abundances were obtained from the
analysis of these indicators which was carried out assuming local thermodynamic
equilibrium and plane-parallel model atmospheres. Abundances derived from OI
were corrected for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. Stellar
parameters were computed using Teff-vs-color calibrations based on the infrared
flux method and Balmer line profiles, Hipparcos parallaxes and FeII lines.
[O/Fe] values derived from the forbidden line at 630.03 nm are consistent with
an oxygen/iron ratio that varies linearly with [Fe/H] as
[O/Fe]}=-0.09(+/-0.08)[Fe/H]+0.36(+/-0.15). Values based on the OI triplet are
on average 0.19+/-0.22 dex(s.d.) higher than the values based on the forbidden
line while the agreement between OH ultraviolet lines and the forbidden line is
much better with a mean difference of the order of -0.09+/-0.25 dex(s.d.). In
general, our results follow the same trend as previously published results with
the exception of the ones based on OH ultraviolet lines. In that case our
results lie below the values which gave rise to the oxygen abundance debate for
metal-poor stars.

the planet's orbital radius. The mass flow rate across the gap (and onto the

zero-SL point. We find such \textit{alternate solitons} and identify their
stability regions in the 2D and 1D models. Three types of the dynamical regimes
are distinguished: stable, unstable, and semi-stable. In the latter case, the
soliton sheds off a conspicuous part of its initial norm before relaxing to a
stable regime. In the 2D case, the threshold (minimum number of atoms)
necessary for the existence of the alternate solitons is essentially higher
than its counterparts for the ordinary and gap solitons in the static model. In
the 1D model, the alternate solitons are also found only above a certain
threshold, while the static 1D models have no threshold. In the 1D case, stable
antisymmetric alternate solitons are found too. Additionally, we consider a
possibility to apply the variational approximation (VA) to the description of
stationary gap solitons, in the case of constant positive SL. It predicts the
solitons in the first finite bandgap very accurately, and does it reasonably
well in the second gap too. In higher bands, the VA predicts a border between
tightly and loosely bound solitons.

that the non-quasiparticle (NQP) states exist in the majority or minority spin

obtained in various models of HMF, an important role of the hybridization

in a binary mixture of smaller spheres, and a semipermeable membrane. The
colloid is modeled as a big hard sphere and the membrane is represented as an
infinitely thin surface which is fully permeable to one of the smaller spheres
and impermeable to the other one. Within the framework of the density
functional theory we evaluate the depletion potentials, and we consider two
different approximate theories - the simple Asakura-Oosawa approximation and
the accurate White-Bear version of the fundamental measure theory. The
effective potentials are compared with the corresponding potentials for a hard,
nonpermeable wall. Using statistical-mechanical sum rules we argue that the
contact value of the depletion potential between a colloid and a semipermeable
membrane is smaller in magnitude than the potential between a colloid and a
hard wall. Explicit calculations confirm that the colloid-semipermeable
membrane effective interactions are generally weaker than these near a hard
nonpermeable wall. This effect is more pronounced for smaller osmotic
pressures. The depletion potential for a colloidal particle inside a
semipermeable vesicle is stronger than the potential for the colloidal particle
located outside of a vesicle. We find that the asymptotic decay of the
depletion potential for the semipermeable membrane is similar to that for the
nonpermeable wall and reflects the asymptotics of the total correlation
function of the corresponding binary mixture of smaller spheres. Our results
demonstrate that the ability of the membrane to change its shape constitutes an
important factor in determining the effective interactions between the
semipermeable membrane and the colloidal macroparticle.

entirely without the possession of channel state information (CSI) by either
the transmitter or the receiver. For an isotropically random unitary input we
obtain the exact closed-form expression for the probability density of the

of its mutual information. We compare the performance of DUSTM and USTM through
both numerical computations of mutual information and through the analysis of
low- and high-SNR asymptotic expressions. In our comparisons the symbol
durations of the equivalent unitary space-time signals are both equal to T, as
are the number of receive antennas N. For DUSTM the number of transmit antennas
is constrained by the scheme to be M = T/2, while USTM has no such constraint.
If DUSTM and USTM utilize the same number of transmit antennas at high SNR's
the normalized mutual information of the differential and the nondifferential
schemes expressed in bits/sec/Hz are asymptotically equal, with the
differential scheme performing somewhat better, while at low SNR's the
normalized mutual information of DUSTM is asymptotically twice the normalized
mutual information of USTM. If, instead, USTM utilizes the optimum number of
transmit antennas then USTM can outperform DUSTM at sufficiently low SNR's.

inequalities, solvers often exploit pruning techniques, which remove redundant
value combinations from the domains of variables, at pruning steps. To find the
complete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with
branching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the
so-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for
solving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that
uses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection
search. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions
are isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums
of solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper,
we propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants,
which not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case,
but also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These
new search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the
construction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our
experiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by
one order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of
solutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the
solutions are isolated.

employing potentials obtained from relativistic and non-relativistic
self-consistent mean-field models. The nuclear and Coulomb potentials are used
to obtain the tunneling probability and, in one model variant, also the
knocking frequency. The model contains only one parameter. We compare this
approach employing several modern mean-field parametrizations to experimental
data and to the semi-empirical Viola-Seaborg systematics. We extrapolate our
model to superheavy nuclei where assumptions entering semi-empirical approaches
might lose validity.

by a sink flow of constant flow rate to form a sharp tip. Using a microscope,
the interface shape is recorded down to a tip size of 1 $\rm{\mu m}$. The
curvature at the tip is controlled by the distance $h$ between the tip and the
sink. As a critical distance $h^{\star}$ is approached, the curvature diverges
like $1/(h-h^{\star})^3$ and the tip becomes cone-shaped. As the distance to
the sink is decreased further, the opening angle of the cone vanishes like
$h^2$. No evidence for air entrainment was found, except when the tip was
inside the orifice.

  considering whether to submit it for publication",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.CB",,"  In this note, we present a hypothesis for the emergence of the phenomenon of
sleep in organisms with sufficiently developed central nervous systems. We
argue that sleep emerges because individual neurons must periodically enter a
resting state and perform various ``garbage collection'' activities. Because
the proper functioning of the central nervous system is dependent on the
interconnections amongst a large collection of individual neurons, it becomes
optimal, from the standpoint of the organism, for these garbage collection
activities to occur simultaneously. We present analogies with complex
structures in modern economies to make our case, although we emphasize that our
hypothesis is purely speculative at this time. Although the ``garbage
collection'' hypothesis has been previously advanced, we believe that our
speculation is useful because it illustrates the power of a general paradigm
for understanding the emergence of collective behavior in agent-built systems.

suitable definition of randomness, gives probability distributions having total
variation distance at least a universal constant times the Frobenius distance
between the two states, with high probability. This result gives us the first
sufficient condition and an information-theoretic solution for the following
quantum state distinction problem: given an a priori known ensemble of quantum
states, is there a single POVM that gives reasonably large total variation
distance between every pair of states from the ensemble? Our random POVM method
also gives us the first information-theoretic upper bound on the number of
copies required to solve the quantum state identification problem for general
ensembles, i.e., given some number of independent copies of a quantum state
from an a priori known ensemble, identify the state. The standard quantum
approach to solving the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is a special case of the
state identification problem where the ensemble consists of so-called coset
states of candidate hidden subgroups. Combining Fourier sampling with our
random POVM result gives us single register algorithms using polynomially many
copies of the coset state that identify hidden subgroups having polynomially
bounded rank in every representation of the ambient group. These HSP algorithms
complement earlier results about the powerlessness of random Fourier sampling
when the ranks are exponentially large, which happens for example in the HSP
over the symmetric group. The drawback of random Fourier sampling based
algorithms is that they are not efficient because measuring in a random basis
is not. This leads us to the open question of efficiently implementable
pseudo-random measurement bases.
