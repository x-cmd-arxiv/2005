precision determinations of neutrino masses and inflationary models. The high-z
surveys are more useful for cosmology than low-z ones owing to much weaker
non-linearities in matter clustering, redshift-space distortion and galaxy
bias. We can then utilize the two-dimensional information of the linear power
spectrum in angular and redshift space to measure the scale-dependent
suppression of matter clustering due to neutrino free-streaming as well as the
shape of the primordial power spectrum. To illustrate capabilities of high-z
surveys for constraining neutrino masses and the primordial power spectrum, we
compare three future redshift surveys covering 300 square degrees at 0.5<z<2,
2<z<4, and 3.5<z<6.5. We find that, combined with the cosmic microwave
background data expected from the Planck satellite, these surveys allow
precision determination of the total neutrino mass with the projected errors of
sigma(m_nu)=0.059, 0.043, and 0.025 eV, respectively, thus yielding a positive
detection of the neutrino mass rather than an upper limit, as sigma(m_nu) is
smaller than the lower limits to the neutrino masses implied from the neutrino
oscillation experiments. The accuracies of constraining the tilt and running
index of the primordial power spectrum, sigma(n_s)=(3.8, 3.7, 3.0)x10^-3, and
sigma(alpha_s)=(5.9, 5.7, 2.4)x10^-3, respectively, are smaller than the
current uncertainties by more than an order of magnitude, which will allow us
to discriminate between candidate inflationary models. In particular, the error
on alpha_s from the highest redshift survey is not very far away from the
prediction of a class of simple inflationary models driven by a massive scalar
field with self-coupling, alpha_s=-(0.8-1.2)x10^-3.

the galaxy population. The evolution arises from the disruption of galactic
disks during mergers that make a larger fractional mass contribution to bulges
at low redshift than at earlier epochs. There is no comparable growth mode for
the black hole population. Thus, this effect produces evolution in the
mBH-mbulge relation that is driven by bulge mass growth and not by black holes.

Kotov et al. (2001), seeks to explain the spectral-timing properties of the
X-ray variability of accreting black holes in terms of inward-propagating mass
accretion fluctuations produced at a broad range of radii. The fluctuations
modulate the X-ray emitting region as they move inwards and can produce
temporal-frequency-dependent lags between energy bands, and energy-dependent
power spectral densities (PSDs) as a result of the different emissivity
profiles, which may be expected at different X-ray energies. Here we use a
simple numerical implementation to investigate in detail the X-ray
spectral-timing properties of the model and their relation to several
physically interesting parameters, namely the emissivity profile in different
energy bands, the geometrical thickness and viscosity parameter of the
accretion flow, the strength of damping on the fluctuations and the temporal
coherence (measured by the `quality-factor', Q) of the fluctuations introduced
at each radius. We find that a geometrically thick flow with large viscosity
parameter is favoured, and confirm that the predicted lags are quite robust to
changes in the emissivity profile, and physical parameters of the accretion
flow, which may help to explain the similarity of the lag spectra in the
low/hard and high/soft states of Cyg X-1. We also demonstrate the model regime
where the light curves in different energy bands are highly spectrally
coherent. We compare model predictions directly to X-ray data from the Narrow
Line Seyfert~1 galaxy NGC 4051 and the BHXRB Cyg X-1 in its high/soft state and
show that this general scheme can reproduce simultaneously the time lags and
energy-dependence of the PSD.

scenario where the relative number of Type Ia supernovae contributing to the
enrichment of the intra-cluster medium is ~25%, while the relative number of
core collapse supernovae is ~75%. Comparison of the observed abundances to the
supernova yields does not allow us to put any constrains on the contribution of
Pop III stars to the enrichment of the ICM. Radial abundance profiles show a
strong central peak of both Type Ia and core collapse supernova products. Both
the temperature and iron abundance maps show an asymmetry in the direction of
the elongated morphology of the surface brightness. In particular the
temperature map shows a sharp change over a brightness edge on the southern
side of the core, which was identified as a cold front in the Chandra data.
This suggests that the cluster is in the process of a merger with a subcluster.
Moreover, we find that the blobs or filaments discovered in the core of the
cluster by Chandra are, contrary to the previous results, colder than the
ambient gas and they appear to be in pressure equilibrium with their

that the extraordinarily luminous radio emission is well described by a
self-absorption dominated synchrotron spectrum while the observed X-ray
emission at t~30 days is adequately fit by Inverse Compton scattering of the
optical photons off of the synchrotron emitting electrons. Our radio model
implies a sub-relativistic ejecta velocity, v ~ 0.24c, at t_0 ~ 10 days after
the explosion which emphasizes that broad optical absorption lines do not imply
relativistic ejecta. We find that the total energy of the radio emitting region
evolves as E ~ 7.3 x 10^{48} (t/t_0)^{0.4} erg assuming equipartition of energy
between relativistic electrons and magnetic fields (e_e=e_B=0.1). The
circumstellar density is well described by a stellar wind profile with modest
(factor of ~2) episodic density enhancements which produce abrupt achromatic
flux variations. We estimate an average progenitor mass loss rate of M_dot ~ 3
x 10^{-4} solar masses per year (assuming a wind velocity of 1000 km/s),
consistent with the observed values for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars. Comparison
with other events reveals that ~50% of radio supernovae show similar short
timescale flux variations attributable to circumstellar density irregularities.
Specifically, the radio light-curves of SN 2003bg are strikingly similar to
those of the Type IIb SN 2001ig, suggestive of a common progenitor evolution.

episodes just prior to the SN explosion. [ABRIDGED]

very consistent constraints on ages from the three Balmer indices Hbeta,
Hgamma, and Hdelta, in good agreement with those of Proctor and Sansom based on
a completely different method. Like other studies in the literature, we find
that bulges have relatively low luminosity weighted ages, the lowest age
derived for the smallest bulges being 1.3 Gyr. Hence bulges are not generally
old but actually rejuvenated systems. We discuss evidence that this might be
true also for the bulge of the Milky Way. We show that the smallest bulges,
being the youngest with the lowest alpha/Fe ratios, must have experienced star
formation events involving 10-30 per cent of their total mass in the past 1-2
Gyr. No significant correlations of the stellar population parameters with
Hubble Type are found instead. We show that the relationships with sigma
coincide perfectly with those of early-type galaxies. Hence, bulges are
typically seen younger, metal-poorer and less alpha/Fe enhanced than early-type
galaxies, only because of their smaller masses. At a given velocity dispersion,
bulges and elliptical galaxies are indistinguishable as far as their stellar
populations are concerned. These results favour an inside-out formation
scenario and indicate that the discs in spiral galaxies of Hubble types Sbc and
earlier cannot have a significant influence on the evolution of the stellar
populations in the bulge component. The phenomenon of pseudobulge formation

highly inclined orbit can be affected both by the motion of the pulsar's
companion because of the finite time it takes a photon to cross the binary, and
by the gravitational light bending if the orbit is sufficiently edge-on
relative to the line of sight. Here we calculate the effect of retardation due
to the companion's motion on various time delays in pulsar binaries, including
the Shaipro delay, the geometric lensing delay, and the lens-induced delays
associated with the pulsar rotation. Our results can be applied to systems so
highly inclined that near conjunction gravitational lensing of the pulsar
radiation by the companion becomes important (the recently discovered double
pulsar system J0737-3039 may exemplify such a system). To the leading order,
the effect of retardation is to shift all the delay curves backward in time
around the orbit conjunction, without affecting the shape and amplitude of the
curves. The time shift is of order the photon orbit crossing time, and ranges
from a second to a few minutes for the observed binary pulsar systems. In the
double pulsar system J0737-3039, the motion of the companion may also affect
the interpretation of the recent correlated interstellar scintillation
measurements. Finally, we show that lensing sets an upper limit on the
magnitude of the frame-dragging time delay caused by the companion's spin, and
makes this delay unobservable in stellar-mass binary pulsar systems.

Airy rings, and are suitable for high dynamical range imaging of extrasolar
terrestrial planets (ETPs). To reach this goal, classical pupil apodization
(CPA) unfortunately requires most of the light gathered by the telescope to be
absorbed, resulting in poor throughput and low angular resolution.
Phase-induced amplitude apodization (PIAA) of the telescope pupil (Guyon 2003)
combines the advantages of classical pupil apodization (particularly low
sensitivity to low order aberrations) with full throughput, no loss of angular
resolution and little chromaticity, which makes it, theoretically, an extremely
attractive coronagraph for direct imaging of ETPs. The two most challenging
aspects of this technique are (1) the difficulty to polish the required optics
shapes and (2) diffraction propagation effects which, because of their
chromaticity, can decrease the spectral bandwidth of the coronagraph. We show
that a properly designed hybrid system combining classical apodization with the
PIAA technique can solve both problems simultaneously. For such a system, the
optics shapes can be well within today's optics manufacturing capabilities, and
the $10^{-10}$ PSF contrast at $\approx 1.5 \lambda/D$ required for efficient
imaging of ETPs can be maintained over the whole visible spectrum. This updated
design of the PIAA coronagraph maintains the high performance of the earlier
design, since only a small part of the light is lost in the classical
apodizer(s).

state of the art cosmological simulations to quantify this effect by comparing
pure N-body dark matter runs with corresponding hydrodynamical simulations,
carried out both in non-radiative, and in dissipative form with cooling and
star formation. In both hydrodynamical simulations, the clustering of the gas
is suppressed while that of dark matter is boosted at scales k>1 h/Mpc. Despite
this counterbalance between dark matter and gas, the clustering of the total
matter is suppressed by up to 1 percent at 1<k<10 h/Mpc, while for k ~ 20 h/Mpc
it is boosted, up to 2 percent in the non-radiative run and 10 percent in the

This has been interpreted as a signature of strongly fluctuating radiation
fields, or patchy reionization. To test this claim, we calculate the scatter
arising solely from density fluctuations, with a uniform ionizing background,
using analytic arguments and simulations. This scatter alone is comparable to
that observed. It rises steeply with redshift and is of order unity by z ~ 6,
even on ~ 50 Mpc/h scales. This arises because: i) at z ~ 6, transmission
spectra, which are sensitive mainly to rare voids, are highly biased (with a
linear bias factor b >~ 4-5) tracers of underlying density fluctuations, and
ii) projected power from small-scale transverse modes is aliased to long
wavelength line-of-sight modes. Inferring patchy reionization from quasar

Similarly, we expect order unity transmission fluctuations in the z ~ 3 HeII

We argue (a) that these are simply the mechanisms of low-mass star formation,
and (b) that they are not mutually exclusive. If, as seems possible, all four
mechanisms operate in nature, their relative importance may eventually be
constrained by their ability to reproduce the binary statistics of brown

extragalactic optically thin sources and a flexible parameterization of the

spectra show evidence for multi-temperature differential emission measures and
low coronal metal abundances (Z~0.3). The G- and K-type stars follow the same
relationship between X-ray activity and Rossby number established in older
clusters and field stars, although most solar-type stars in NGC 2547 exhibit
saturated/super-saturated X-ray activity levels. Median levels of Lx and
Lx/Lbol in the solar-type stars of NGC 2547 are similar to T-Tauri stars of the
Orion Nebula cluster (ONC), but an order of magnitude higher than in the older
Pleiades. The spread in X-ray activity levels among solar-type stars in NGC
2547 is much smaller than in older or younger clusters. Coronal temperatures
increase with Lx, Lx/Lbol and surface X-ray flux. Active solar-type stars in
NGC 2547 have coronal temperatures between those in the ONC and the most active
older ZAMS stars. A flaring rate (for total flare energies [0.3-3keV] >10^{34}
erg) of 1 every 350^{+350}_{-120} ks was found for solar-type stars, similar to
rates found in the ONC and Pleiades. Comparison with ROSAT HRI data taken 7
years previously reveals that only 10-15 percent of solar-type stars or stars
with Lx>3x10^{29} erg/s exhibit X-ray variability by more than a factor of two.
The similar levels of X-ray activity and rate of occurrence for large flares in

young solar-type stars remains relatively constant over their first 30 Myr

to increase. The question arises on {\it what particular entropic form} we have
in mind and {\it how it increases} with $N$. Thermodynamically speaking it
makes sense to choose an entropy which increases {\it linearly} with $N$ for
large $N$, i.e., which is {\it extensive}. If the $N$ elements are
probabilistically {\it independent} (no interactions) or quasi-independent
(e.g., {\it short}-range interacting), it is known that the entropy which is
extensive is that of Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon, $S_{BG} \equiv -k \sum_{i=1}^W
p_i \ln p_i$. If they are however {\it globally correlated} (e.g., through {\it
long}-range interactions), the answer depends on the particular nature of the
correlations. There is a large class of correlations (in one way or another
related to scale-invariance) for which an appropriate entropy is that on which
nonextensive statistical mechanics is based, i.e., $S_q \equiv k
\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ ($S_1=S_{BG}$), where $q$ is determined by
the specific correlations. We briefly review and illustrate these ideas through
simple examples of occupation of phase space. A very similar scenario emerges
with regard to the central limit theorem. We present some numerical indications
along these lines. The full clarification of such a possible connection would
help qualifying the class of systems for which the nonextensive statistical
concepts are applicable, and, concomitantly, it would enlighten the reason for

spin in a quantum dot under optical excitation and photon detection. When a
pair of applied laser fields satisfy two-photon resonance between the two
ground electronic spin states, detection of light scattering from the
intermediate exciton state acts as a weak quantum measurement of the effective
magnetic (Overhauser) field due to the nuclear spins. If the spin were driven
into a coherent population trapping state where no light scattering takes
place, then the nuclear state would be projected into an eigenstate of the
Overhauser field operator and electron decoherence due to nuclear spins would
be suppressed: we show that this limit can be approached by adapting the laser
frequencies when a photon is detected. We use a Lindblad equation to describe
the time evolution of the driven system under photon emission and detection.
Numerically, we find an increase of the electron coherence time from 5 ns to
500 ns after a preparation time of 10 microseconds.

is the rank of the orientational correlation function (given in terms of the
Legendre polynomial of rank $l$). One often finds significant deviation from
this prediction, in either direction. In supercooled molecular liquids where
the ratio $\tau_{1}/\tau_{2}$ falls considerably below three (the Debye limit),
one usually invokes a jump diffusion model to explain the approach of the ratio
$\tau_{1}/\tau_{2}$ to unity. Here we show in a computer simulation study of a
standard model system for thermotropic liquid crystals that this ratio becomes
much less than unity as the isotropic-nematic phase boundary is approached from
the isotropic side. Simultaneously, the ratio $\tau_2/\eta$ (where $\eta$ is
the shear viscosity of the liquid) becomes {\it much larger} than hydrodynamic
value near the I-N transition. We have also analyzed the break down of the
Debye model of rotational diffusion in ratios of higher order rotational
correlation times. We show that the break down of the DSE model is due to the
growth of orientational pair correlation and provide a mode coupling theory

model undergoes the same type condensation transitions as those on regular

distribution completely disappears and no phase transitions occurs. Instead,
the condensation with exponentially decaying background mass distribution
always takes place for any non-zero density. For the existence of the condensed
phase for $\gamma \leq 3$ at the zero density limit, we investigate one
lamb-lion problem on RNs and SFNs. We numerically show that a lamb survives

of a lamb on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$ ensures the existence of the

direct numerical simulations are practically impossible. At $\omega = \infty$,
we numerically confirm that complete condensation takes place for any $\rho >

current amplitude was studied. At low current amplitudes, the first harmonic
dominates in the frequency spectrum of the voltage, and at sufficiently high
current amplitudes, the amplitude of the second harmonic becomes higher than
that of the first harmonic. For air-annealed ribbons, the asymmetric two-peak
behaviour of the field dependences of the harmonic amplitudes was observed,
which is related to the coupling between the amorphous phase and surface
crystalline layers appearing after annealing. For vacuum-annealed samples, the
first harmonic has a maximum at zero external field, and the field dependence
of the second harmonic exhibits symmetric two-peak behaviour. The experimental
results are interpreted in terms of a quasi-static rotational model. It is

physical behavior. A landmark theoretical result in few-body quantum physics is
Efimov's prediction of a universal set of bound trimer states appearing for
three identical bosons with a resonant two-body interaction.
Counterintuitively, these states even exist in the absence of a corresponding
two-body bound state. Since the formulation of Efimov's problem in the context
of nuclear physics 35 years ago, it has attracted great interest in many areas
of physics. However, the observation of Efimov quantum states has remained an
elusive goal. Here we report the observation of an Efimov resonance in an
ultracold gas of cesium atoms. The resonance occurs in the range of large
negative two-body scattering lengths, arising from the coupling of three free
atoms to an Efimov trimer. Experimentally, we observe its signature as a giant
three-body recombination loss when the strength of the two-body interaction is
varied. We also detect a minimum in the recombination loss for positive
scattering lengths, indicating destructive interference of decay pathways. Our
results confirm central theoretical predictions of Efimov physics and represent
a starting point with which to explore the universal properties of resonantly
interacting few-body systems. While Feshbach resonances have provided the key
to control quantum-mechanical interactions on the two-body level, Efimov
resonances connect ultracold matter to the world of few-body quantum phenomena.

level is split into two components of multiplicity 4 and 2, respectively due to
coupling of the spin states of the hole in 3d$_{5/2}$ with Pr 4f holes spin
state. The observed splitting is 4.5 eV. The VB spectrum is interpreted using
density of states (DOS) calculations under LDA and LDA+U. It is noted that LDA
is not sufficient to explain the observed VB spectrum. Inclusion of on-site
Coulomb correlation for Co 3d electrons in LDA+U calculations gives DOS which
is useful in qualitative explanation of the ground state. However, it is
necessary to include interactions between Pr 4f electrons to get better
agreement with experimental VB spectrum. It is seen that the VB consists of Pr
4f, Co 3d and O 2p states. Pr 4f, Co 3d and O 2p bands are highly mixed
indicating strong hybridization of these three states. The band near the Fermi
level has about equal contributions from Pr 4f and O 2p states with somewhat
smaller contribution from Co 3d states. Thus in the Zaanen, Sawatzky, and Allen
scheme PrCoO$_3$ can be considered as charge transfer insulator. The charge
transfer energy $\Delta$ can be obtained using LDA DOS calculations and the
Coulomb-exchange energy U' from LDA+U. The explicit values for PrCoO$_3$ are
$\Delta$ = 3.9 eV and U' = 5.5 eV; the crystal field splitting and 3d bandwidth

tradeoffs that exist between important language characteristics such as safety
properties, expressive power, and succinctness. Unfortunately, such tradeoffs
are little understood, a situation we try to correct by embarking on a study of
metaprogramming language tradeoffs using tools from computability theory.
Safety properties of metaprograms are in general undecidable; for example, the
property that a metaprogram always halts and produces a type-correct instance
is $\Pi^0_2$-complete. Although such safety properties are undecidable, they
may sometimes be captured by a restricted language, a notion we adapt from
complexity theory. We give some sufficient conditions and negative results on
when languages capturing properties can exist: there can be no languages
capturing total correctness for metaprograms, and no `functional' safety
properties above $\Sigma^0_3$ can be captured. We prove that translating a
metaprogram from a general-purpose to a restricted metaprogramming language
capturing a property is tantamount to proving that property for the
metaprogram. Surprisingly, when one shifts perspective from programming to
metaprogramming, the corresponding safety questions do not become substantially
harder -- there is no `jump' of Turing degree for typical safety properties.

to the smooth extension exist, but a continuous extension (in fact, valid for

the model-independent constraints on naturalness from squark, gluino, chargino

R-symmetric limits of the NMSSM, where cascade decays or additional quartic
interactions can hide a Higgs without relying on heavy stops. Obtaining viable
electroweak symmetry breaking requires a tuning of $\sim 1-10%$ in the PQ

and this introduces an additional weak-scale tuning of $\sim 10%$. The
R-symmetric limit requires large marginal couplings, a large singlet soft mass,
and a tuning of $\sim 5-10%$ to break electroweak symmetry. Hiding MSSM-like
Higgs states below $\approx 112$ GeV requires additional tunings of A-terms at
the $\sim 1-10%$ level. Thus, although the NMSSM has rich discovery potential,

give rise to realistic compactifications of the strongly coupled heterotic
string. When vector bundles are constructed using extensions, we provide simple
rules to determine lower and upper bounds to the region of the Kaehler moduli
space where such compactifications can exist. We show how small these regions
can be, working out in full detail the case of the recently proposed Heterotic
Standard Model. More explicitely, we exhibit Kaehler classes in these regions
for which the visible vector bundle is stable. On the other hand, there is no
polarization for which the hidden bundle is stable.

Chiral Perturbation Theory, which is the low-energy formulation of Quantum
Chromodynamics, where we extend the spectrum of active degrees of freedom from
only pions and nucleons to also the Delta(1232) resonance. In the deuteron
sector, we treat the nucleon-nucleon interaction non-perturbatively. Besides
the Compton cross sections, our main concern is with the nucleon
polarizabilities, which are a useful tool to describe the reaction of the
internal nucleonic degrees of freeedom to the external electromagnetic field.
Experimentally, only a few nucleon polarizabilities are known. Especially our
present knowledge of the neutron polarizabilities is not satisfying. The reason
why it is so difficult to determine these quantities experimentally is the
finite lifetime of the free neutron. Therefore, we want to contribute to the
ongoing discussion of the neutron polarizabilities by fitting the average over
proton and neutron polarizabilities to the elastic deuteron Compton-scattering
data. Similarly, we determine the proton polarizabilities from fits to the
single-proton Compton data. We finally combine both results in order to
identify the neutron polarizabilities.

approach is limited to polynitriles. We demonstrate that the latter faces a
formidable problem: the electron attaches to the nitrile groups forming
molecular anions with bent C-C-N fragments. Since the energy cost of this
bending is very high, for dinitrile anions in n-hexane, the binding energies
for the electron are very low and for mononitriles, these binding energies are
lower still, and the entropy of electron attachment is anomalously small.
Density functional theory modeling of electron trapping by mononitriles in
n-hexane suggests that the mononitrile molecules substitute for the solvent
molecules at the electron cavity, ""solvating"" the electron by their methyl
groups. Such ""solvated electrons"" resemble multimer radical anions in which the
electron density is shared (mainly) between C 2p orbitals in the solute/solvent

system. The social standing of an individual agent is represented by an
integer-valued fitness that changes via two offsetting processes. When two
agents interact one advances: the fitter with probability p and the less fit
with probability 1-p. The fitness of an agent may also decline with rate r.
  From a scaling analysis of the underlying master equations for the fitness
distribution of the population, we find four distinct social structures as a
function of the governing parameters p and r. These include: (i) a static
lower-class society where all agents have finite fitness; (ii) an
upwardly-mobile middle-class society; (iii) a hierarchical society where a
finite fraction of the population belongs to a middle class and a complementary
fraction to the lower class; (iv) an egalitarian society where all agents are
upwardly mobile and have nearly the same fitness. We determine the basic
features of the fitness distributions in these four phases.

method is here extended to the 2D tensorial apparent resistivity acquisition
mode. The rotational invariant derived from the trace of the apparent
resistivity tensor is considered, since it gives on the datum plane anomalies
confined above the buried objects. Firstly, a departure function is introduced
as the difference between the tensorial invariant measured over the real
structure and that computed for a reference uniform structure. Secondly, a
resistivity anomaly occurrence probability (RAOP) function is defined as a
normalised crosscorrelation involving the experimental departure function and a
scanning function derived analytically using the Frechet derivative of the
electric potential for the reference uniform structure. The RAOP function can
be calculated in each cell of a 3D grid filling the investigated volume, and
the resulting values can then be contoured in order to obtain the 3D
tomographic image. Each non-vanishing value of the RAOP function is interpreted
as the probability which a resistivity departure from the reference resistivity
obtain in a cell as responsible of the observed tensorial apparent resistivity
dataset on the datum plane. A synthetic case shows that the highest RAOP values
correctly indicate the position of the buried objects and a very high spacial
resolution can be obtained even for adjacent objects with opposite resistivity
contrasts with respect to the resistivity of the hosting matrix. Finally, an
experimental field case dedicated to an archaeological application of the
resistivity tensor method is presented as a proof of the high resolution power
of the probability tomography imaging, even when the data are collected in

characterize the covariance matrix of pure and mixed three-mode Gaussian states
up to local unitary operations, showing that the local entropies of pure
Gaussian states are bound to fulfill a relationship which is stricter than the
general Araki-Lieb inequality. Quantum correlations will be quantified by a
proper convex roof extension of the squared logarithmic negativity (the
contangle), satisfying a monogamy relation for multimode Gaussian states, whose
proof will be reviewed and elucidated. The residual contangle, emerging from
the monogamy inequality, is an entanglement monotone under Gaussian local
operations and classical communication and defines a measure of genuine
tripartite entanglement. We analytically determine the residual contangle for
arbitrary pure three-mode Gaussian states and study the distribution of quantum
correlations for such states. This will lead us to show that pure, symmetric
states allow for a promiscuous entanglement sharing, having both maximum
tripartite residual entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between
any pair of modes. We thus name these states GHZ/$W$ states of continuous
variable systems because they are simultaneous continuous-variable counterparts
of both the GHZ and the $W$ states of three qubits. We finally consider the
action of decoherence on tripartite entangled Gaussian states, studying the
decay of the residual contangle. The GHZ/$W$ states are shown to be maximally

noise, it possesses unique two-photon coherence. Thus, for performing
two-photon processes, down-converted light is equivalent to coherent ultrashort
pulses in some aspects and to coherent CW laser radiation in others. This
equivalence is theoretically established and experimentally demonstrated in the
classical, high-power regime. Two applications that take advantage of
multi-photon coherence are then described in detail; one for optical spread
spectrum communication and the other for sub-diffraction limit optical
lithography. A key part of this research is the design and implementation of an
efficient source that generates high-power broadband down conversion in a
cavity. A broadband oscillation in the cavity is ensured by a mechanism very
similar to passive mode-locking of ultrashort pulse laser sources, which we
term as pair-wise mode locking, thus extending the equivalence to ultrashort
pulses to the light generating sources also. Finally, the quantum mechanical
properties of broadband down-conversion are explored experimentally, by
performing a two-photon process (sum frequency generation) at the low power
level of entangled photon pairs. The non-classical nature of the light is
expressed by a linear intensity dependence of the non-linear process. Temporal
shaping with femtosecond resolution of the entangled photon pairs is
