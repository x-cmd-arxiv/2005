offer the capability of direct composition and energy measurements on the
primary particles. A major difficulty is obtaining enough exposure to extend
the range of direct measurements sufficiently high in energy to permit overlap
with ground-based observations. Presently, balloon and space measurements
extend only up to ~100 TeV, well below the range of ground-based experiments.
The prospect of Ultra-Long Duration Balloon missions offers the promise of
multiple long flights that can build up exposure. The status of balloon
measurements to measure the high energy proton and nuclear composition and
spectrum is reviewed, and the statistical considerations involved in searching
for a steepening in the spectrum are discussed. Given the very steeply falling
spectrum, it appears unlikely that balloon experiments will be able to extend
the range of direct measurements beyond 1000 TeV any time in the near future.
Especially given the recent suggestions from KASCADE that the proton spectrum
steepens only at 4000-5000 TeV, the chance of detecting the knee with direct
measurements of protons to iron on balloons is not likely to occur without
significant increases in the payload and flight duration capabilities of high
altitude balloons.

virial starting states. Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100
simulations per case) are used to build up a robust statistical description of
these systems, e.g., distributions of closest approaches, mass profiles, and
distributions of radial locations. These results provide a framework from which
to assess the effects of these clusters on star and planet formation. The
distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with distributions of
FUV luminosities (also calculated here) to determine the radiation exposure of
circumstellar disks. The distributions of closest approaches are used in
conjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here from $10^5$
scattering experiments) to determine the probability of solar system
disruption. We also use the nearby cluster NGC 1333 as a test case. Our main
conclusion is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect on
forming planetary systems: Interaction rates are low so that the typical solar
system experiences a single encounter within 1000 AU. Radiation exposure is
low, with median FUV flux $G_0$ = 900, so that photoevaporation of disks is
only important beyond 30 AU. Given the low interaction rates and modest
radiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event in
these clusters.

while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument
and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with
respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference PSF is constructed from
other appropriately-selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to
remove quasi-static PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to
align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini
North data. It is shown that quasi-static PSF noise can be reduced by a factor
\~5 for each image subtraction. The combination of all residuals then provides
an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of

were gravitationally produced \sim 60e-folds before the end of inflation
produced the nearly scale invariant scalar density fluctuations which are

determine the time at the end of inflation, t_end. At t_end, the Hubble

the M particles, which we identify with the matter content of the universe
today. The time required for the universe to dissipate its vacuum energy into M

bulges of all Hubble types are similar to luminous ellipticals in their central
stellar populations. They have large luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities,
and alpha/Fe ratios. Blue bulges can be separated into a metal-poor class that
is restricted to late-types with small velocity dispersion and a young,
metal-rich class that includes all Hubble types and velocity dispersions.
Luminosity-weighted metallicities and alpha/Fe ratios are sensitive to central
velocity dispersion and maximum disk rotational velocity. Red bulges and

Where positive age gradients (with the central regions being younger) are
present, they are invariably in barred galaxies. The metallicities of bulges

analyze the 850$~\mu$m image of the GOODS HDF-N region. We show that much of
the submillimeter background at this wavelength is picked out by sources with
$H(AB)$ or 3.6um (AB)<23.25 (1.8 uJy). These sources contribute an 850um
background of 24\pm2 Jy deg^-2. This is a much higher fraction of the measured
background (31-45 Jy deg^-2) than is found with current 20cm or 24um samples.
Roughly one-half of these NIR-selected sources have spectroscopic
identifications, and we can assign robust photometric redshifts to nearly all
of the remaining sources using their UV to MIR spectral energy distributions.
We use the redshift and spectral type information to show that a large fraction
of the 850um background light comes from sources with z=0-1.5 and that the
sources responsible have intermediate spectral types. Neither the elliptical
galaxies, which have no star formation, nor the bluest galaxies, which have
little dust, contribute a significant amount of 850um light, despite the fact
that together they comprise approximately half of the galaxies in the sample.
The galaxies with intermediate spectral types have a mean flux of 0.40\pm0.03
mJy at 850um and 9.1\pm0.3 uJy at 20cm.
  The redshift distribution of the NIR-selected 850um light lies well below
that of the much smaller amount of light traced by the more luminous, radio-
selected submillimeter sources. We therefore require a revised star-formation
history with a lower star-formation rate at high redshifts. We use a stacking
analysis of the 20cm light in the NIR sample to show that the star-formation
history of the total 850um sample is relatively flat down to z~1 and that half
of the total star formation occurs at redshifts z<1.4.

0.5 s. This was followed by later emission 10-20 s post-burst. The upper limit

galaxies begin? And what separates these two classes of hot stellar systems?
  We examine to what extend very massive (>10^7 Mo) young star clusters are
similar to their lower mass counter parts and to which degree they resemble
other objects in their mass regime (dwarf--globular transition objects (DGTOs),
ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs), galaxy nuclei).
  The comparison is performed by placing the recently observed very massive
young clusters onto known scaling relation defined by globular clusters (with
typical masses <10^6 Mo) and/or by hot stellar systems with sizes up to those
of giant galaxies.
  The very massive (>10^{6.5-7} Mo) young clusters seem to show a mass--radius
relation compatible with the one defined by hot stellar systems of galaxy mass.
This, in turn, can explain their location on the other scaling relations
investigated. It contrasts with the behaviour of the less massive young
clusters and of globular clusters, which do not exhibit any mass-radius
relation. However, the behaviour of the most massive clusters is similar to
that of most other objects in that mass regime (10^6-10^8 Mo).
  We show that the properties of young massive clusters are compatible with
other objects in the same mass regime such as DGTOs/UCDs. They present a
possible direct avenue of formation for those objects, which does not require
the transformation of a previously existing stellar system. Simulations and
observations support the possibility of the formation of such very massive
young clusters by early mergers of lower mass stellar clusters, which could
explain the emergence of a mass--radius relation.

and Z- sources, on ~sec - msec time scales is caused primarily by variations of
the boundary layer luminosity. The accretion disk emission is less variable on
these time scales and its power density follows 1/f law, contributing to
observed flux variation at low frequencies and low energies only. The kHz QPOs
have the same origin as variability at lower frequencies - independent of the
nature of the ""clock"", the actual luminosity modulation takes place on the NS
surface. The boundary layer spectrum remains nearly constant during luminosity
variations and can be represented by the Fourier frequency resolved spectrum.
In the range of Mdot~(0.1-1)*Mdot_Edd it depends weakly on the global mass
accretion rate and in the limit Mdot~Mdot_Edd is close to Wien spectrum with
kT~2.4 keV. Its independence on the Mdot lends support to the suggestion by
Inogamov & Sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressure
supported.
  Based on the knowledge of the boundary layer spectrum we attempt to relate
the motion along the Z-track to changes of physically meaningful parameters.
Our results suggest that the contribution of the boundary layer to the observed
emission decreases along the Z-track from conventional ~50% on the horizontal
branch to a rather small number on the normal branch. This decrease can be
caused, for example, by obscuration of the boundary layer by the geometrically
thickened accretion disk at Mdot~Mdot_Edd. Alternatively, this can indicate
significant change of the structure of the accretion flow at Mdot~Mdot_Edd and
disappearance of the boundary layer as a distinct region of the significant
energy release associated with the NS surface.

based on L-band data at 3.5 micron taken with SPIREX (South Pole Infrared
Explorer), and 2MASS JHK data at 1.25-2.2 micron. This is the second of two
papers, the first one concerning a similar JHKL survey of 30 Doradus.
Colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams are used to detect sources with
infrared excess. This excess emission is interpreted as coming from
circumstellar disks, and hence gives the cluster disk fraction (CDF). Based on
the CDF and the age of RCW 57, it is possible to draw conclusions on the
formation and early evolution of massive stars. The infrared excess is detected
by comparing the locations of sources in JHKL colour-colour and L vs. (K-L)
colour-magnitude diagrams to the reddening band due to interstellar extinction.
A total of 251 sources were detected. More than 50% of the 209 sources included
in the diagrams have an infrared excess. Comparison with other JHKL surveys,
including the results on 30 Doradus from the first paper, support a very high
initial disk fraction (>80%) even for massive stars, although there is an
indication of a possible faster evolution of circumstellar disks around high
mass stars. 33 sources only found in the L-band indicate the presence of
heavily embedded, massive Class I protostars. We also report the detection of
diffuse PAHs emission throughout the RCW 57 region.

galaxies, in order to predict the epoch of reionization. We use a sophisticated
semi-analytic model to track the formation of galaxies. Our study represents a
much more complete and physically consistent modelling of reionization than has
been conducted in the past, containing significant improvements in the
modelling of the collapse of baryons into dark matter halos, and in the model
for the cooling and condensation of gas within halos (including photoheating
from a self-consistently computed ionizing background and cooling due to H2).
We find that reionization can be achieved by z~10-20 in a LCDM cosmological
model with sigma8~0.9. However, a cosmological model with a running spectral
index is only able to achieve reionization before z~9 if extreme assumptions
are made about the physics of feedback at high redshifts. We also consider the
galaxy formation model discussed by Baugh et al., and find that it is able to
reionize the Universe by z~12. The previous results assume that all of the
ionizing photons produced by stars in galaxies are able to escape and ionize
the IGM. If this is not the case, then the redshift of reionization could be
substantially reduced. We find that extended periods of partial reionization
and double reionizations can occur in models in which the first stars formed
via cooling by H2 molecules, are very massive, and in which the escape fraction
of ionizing photons ~10-30%. Such models do not fully reionize until z~6-7, but
predict an electron scattering optical depth as large as 0.15. Models with
lower sigma8=0.7-0.8 as suggested by the recent WMAP three year data have
reduced redshifts of reionization, but can be consistent with the lower optical
depth also suggested by the WMAP three year data.

lead to the suggestion that such behavior occurs within a quantum critical

down at zero temperature. Such a scenario can be thought of as a bottom-up
approach, with the zero temperature mechanisms finding a way to manifest
critical behavior at high temperatures. Here we propose an alternative,
top-down, mechanism by which strong kinematic constraints that can only be
broken at extremely high temperatures are responsible for critical behavior at
intermediate but still high temperatures. This critical behavior may extend all
the way down to zero temperature, but this outcome is not one of necessity, and
the system may order at low temperatures. We provide explicit examples of such
high-temperature criticality when additional strong interactions are introduced
in quantum Heisenberg, transverse field Ising, and some bosonic lattice models.

temperature behavior of crystalline alkali halide surfaces typified by
NaCl(100), of the liquid NaCl surface near freezing, and of the very unusual
partial wetting of the solid surface by the melt. Simulations are conducted
using two-body rigid ion BMHFT potentials, with full treatment of long-range
Coulomb forces. After a preliminary check of the description of bulk NaCl
provided by these potentials, which seems generally good even at the melting
point, we carry out a new investigation of solid and liquid surfaces. Solid
NaCl(100) is found in this model to be very anharmonic and yet exceptionally
stable when hot. It is predicted by a thermodynamic integration calculation of
the surface free energy that NaCl(100) should be a well ordered, non-melting
surface, metastable even well above the melting point. By contrast, the
simulated liquid NaCl surface is found to exhibit large thermal fluctuations
and no layering order. In spite of that, it is shown to possess a relatively
large surface free energy. The latter is traced to a surface entropy deficit,
reflecting some kind of surface short range order. Finally, the solid-liquid
interface free energy is derived through Young's equation from direct
simulation of partial wetting of NaCl(100) by a liquid droplet. It is concluded
that three elements, namely the exceptional anharmonic stability of the solid
(100) surface, the molecular short range order at the liquid surface, and the
costly solid liquid interface, all conspire to cause the anomalously poor
wetting of the (100) surface by its own melt in the BMHFT model of NaCl -- and
most likely also in real alkali halide surfaces.

network whose links correspond to noisy communication channels, and
broadcasting it through the network. We study the problem of reconstructing the

system limit, reconstruction is possible when the channel noise is smaller than
a threshold.
  We show that this threshold coincides with the dynamical (replica symmetry
breaking) glass transition for an associated statistical physics problem.
Motivated by this correspondence, we derive a variational principle which
implies new rigorous bounds on the reconstruction threshold. Finally, we apply
a standard numerical procedure used in statistical physics, to predict the
reconstruction thresholds in various channels. In particular, we prove a bound
on the reconstruction problem for the antiferromagnetic ``Potts'' channels,
which implies, in the noiseless limit, new results on random proper colorings
of infinite regular trees.
  This relation to the reconstruction problem also offers interesting
perspective for putting on a clean mathematical basis the theory of glasses on
random graphs.

to test if a logic program terminates for a given concrete or moded query, (2)
to test if a logic program terminates for all concrete or moded queries, and

interesting cases, these constraints take the form of recurrence relations.

approximates the ground state of a certain dilute large quantum system; the

provides a plausible explanation for the origin of mass and leads to the
unification of mass and electric charge through their coupling. By means of an
electromagnetic approach, the calculated mass of the proton closely
approximates its experimental value and does so with dependence on a single
parameter. That is to say, the proposed fundamental system provides a way to
comprehend the source of mass as a property of the structure of elementary
particles. It brings a new tool to the task of gaining insight into the proton
mass and to unravelling the enigma of proton stability. The inner energy of
elementary particles, or equivalently their mass, is surmised here to have
electrodynamic roots, deriving from the dynamics of a single or pair of
electric charge(s) shaping out their structure. Mass appears as the quantized
balance of two inner energies which conform collapsing action and retentive
reaction. Charge and mass are not taken as independent entities as in the
traditional mode, instead mass appears as a by-product of the charge structural
dynamics, as does the magnetic moment. The proposed model clearly requires a
degree of willingness to consider possibilities not accounted for within the
framework of the Standard Model. So, this proposal is addressed to those who
are open to inspect a different look at the structure of elementary particles
and disposed to compare the two approaches, standing out of doctrinal
captivity.

shortest track from any position. To perform path integration successfully,
speeds and turning angles along the preceding outbound path have to be measured
continuously and combined to determine an internal {\em global vector} leading
back home at any time. A number of experiments have given an idea how
arthropods might use allothetic or idiothetic signals to perceive their
orientation and moving speed. We systematically review the four possible model
descriptions of mathematically precise path integration, whereby we favour and
elaborate the hitherto not used variant of egocentric cartesian coordinates.
Its simple and intuitive structure is demonstrated in comparison to the other
models. Measuring two speeds, the forward moving speed and the angular turning
rate, and implementing them into a linear system of differential equations
provides the necessary information during outbound route, reorientation process
and return path. In addition, we propose several possible types of systematic
errors that can cause deviations from the correct homeward course. Deviations
have been observed for several species of desert arthropods in different
experiments, but their origin is still under debate. Using our egocentric path
integration model we propose simple error indices depending on path geometry
that will allow future experiments to rule out or corroborate certain error
types.

"quant-ph/0512102","A. K. Rajagopal","A. K. Rajagopal and R. W. Rendell","Relationship of Quantum Entanglement to Density Functional Theory",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  The maximum von Neumann entropy principle subject to given constraints of
mean values of some physical observables determines the density matrix.
Similarly the stationary action principle in the case of time-dependent
(dissipative) situations under similar constraints yields the density matrix.
The free energy and measures of entanglement are expressed in terms of such a
density matrix and thus define respective functionals of the mean values. In
the light of several model calculations, it is found that the density matrix
contains information about both quantum entanglement and phase transitions even
though there may not be any direct relationship implied by one on the other.

A 73, 022111 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.022111",,"quant-ph",,"  We study two different decoherence modes for entangled qubits by considering
a Liouville - von Neumann master equation. Mode A is determined by projection
operators onto the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and mode B by projectors onto
rotated states. We present solutions for general and for Bell diagonal states
and calculate for the later the mixedness and the amount of entanglement given
by the concurrence.
  We propose a realization of the decoherence modes within neutron
interferometry by applying fluctuating magnetic fields. An experimental test of
the Kraus operator decomposition describing the evolution of the system for
each mode is presented.

quantum error correction for the LOQC theory, showing how to obtain the
threshold when dealing with Z-measurement errors.

identical or orthogonal polarization are simultaneously incident on one
optically thick metal film, perforated with a periodic array of subwavelength
holes. The de Broglie wavelength of plasmon-assisted transmitted photons is
measured, which shows that two photons are re-eradiated by the plasmons and the
quantum coherence of biphoton is preserved in the conversion process of
transforming biphoton to plasmons and then back to biphoton.
