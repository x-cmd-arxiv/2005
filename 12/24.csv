unabsorbed X-ray, radio, and optical fluxes and luminosities of FRI-type
radio-galaxy cores, implying a common origin in the form of a jet. On the other
hand, we find that the X-ray spectra of FRII-type radio-galaxy cores is
dominated by absorbed emission, with $N_{\rm H} > 10^{23}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$,
that is likely to originate in an accretion flow. We discuss several models
which may account for the different nuclear properties of FRI- and FRII-type
cores, and also demonstrate that both heavily obscured, accretion-related, and
unobscured, jet-related components may be present in all radio-galaxy nuclei.
Any absorbed, accretion-related, components in FRI-type galaxies have low

350 years based on the overall motion of the nebula that exhibits a
Hubble-law-esque linear relation between the measured proper motion and the
projected radial distance from the origin of the expansion. By adopting the
de-projected velocity of 45 km/s at the tips of the bipolar lobes, our
proper-motion measurements indicate that the distance to the Egg Nebula is
about 420 pc and that the lobes are inclined at 7.7 degrees with respect to the

central star of 3.3 x 10^3 L_sun, the total shell mass of 1.2 M_sun, and the
mass loss rate (the upper limit) of 3.6 x 10^(-3) M_sun/yr. Assuming 0.6 M_sun

hardness ratios and emitted powers, but, on the average, the post-quiescence

various inner engine models. At the contrary, if the inner engine is assumed to
be always active, i.e. also during the quiescent times, in several cases the
total duration of the burst largely exceeds the theoretical durations. Our
analysis therefore does not support the interpretation of long quiescent times

ultrathin films with quantum size effect (QSE) is discussed. The emphasis is on
comparison of films with Gaussian, exponential, and power-law long-range
behavior of the correlation function of surface, thickness, or bulk
fluctuations. For small-size inhomogeneities, the mode coupling is the same for
inhomogeneities of all types and the transport coefficients behave in the same
way. The mode coupling becomes extremely sensitive to the correlators for
large-size inhomogeneities leading to the drastically distinct behavior of the
transport coefficients. In high-quality films there is a noticeable difference
between the QSE patterns for films with bulk and surface inhomogeneities which
explains why the recently predicted new type of QSE with large oscillations of
the transport coefficients can be observed mostly in films with surface-driven
relaxation. In such films with surface-dominated scattering the higher modes
contribute to the transport only as a result of opening of the corresponding
mode coupling channels and appear one by one. Mode coupling also explains a
much higher transport contribution from the higher modes than it is commonly
believed. Possible correlations between the inhomogeneities from the opposite
walls provide, because of their oscillating response to the mode quantum
numbers, a unique insight into the mode coupling. The presence of
inhomogeneities of several sizes leads not to a mechanical mixture of QSE
patterns, but to the overall shifting and smoothing of the oscillations. The
results can lead to new, non-destructive ways of analysis of the buried
interfaces and to study of inhomogeneities on the scales which are inaccessible
for scanning techniques.

peculiarities of the Hilbert space on which the RFT Hamiltonian acts. We
develop a perturbative expansion in the RFT framework, and find several
eigenstates of the zeroth order Hamiltonian. The zeroth order of this
perturbation preserves the number of $s$ - channel gluons. The eigenstates have
a natural interpretation in terms of the $t$ - channel exchanges. Studying the
single $s$ - channel gluon sector we find the eigenstates which include the

conjugation even states. The bound state of two reggeized gluons is the
standard BFKL Pomeron. The intercepts of the other Pomerons in the large $N$

Pomeron, but their coupling in perturbation theory is suppressed by at least
$1/N^2$ relative to the double BFKL Pomeron exchange. For the $[27,27]$ Pomeron

conjugation odd exchanges, one of which is the unit intercept

axion photon vertex, that gives rise to axion photon coupling. The strength of
the tree level axion photon coupling in magnetic field is known to be model

interesting features. This note discusses the new axion photon vertex in a

correction to axion photon coupling, because of magnetized vacuum and matter is

In particular, we deduce the following counterpart to Alexandrov uniqueness
theorem in Euclidean space: any compact, connected, C^2 surface in H^1
area-stationary under a volume constraint must be congruent with a rotationally
symmetric sphere obtained as the union of all the geodesics of the same
curvature joining two points. As a consequence, we solve the isoperimetric
problem in H^1 assuming C^2 smoothness of the solutions.

  generating functions","87 pages, many figures. To appear in SIAM Review",,,,"math.CO",,"  Let $\{a_\rr : \rr \in (\Z^+)^d \}$ be a $d$-dimensional array of numbers,
for which the generating function $F(\zz) := \sum_\rr a_\rr \zz^\rr$ is
meromorphic in a neighborhood of the origin. For example, $F$ may be a rational
multivariate generating function. We discuss recent results that allow the
effective computation of asymptotic expansions for the coefficients of $F$.
  Our purpose is to illustrate the use of these techniques on a variety of
problems of combinatorial interest. The survey begins by summarizing previous
work on the asymptotics of univariate and multivariate generating functions.
Next we describe the Morse-theoretic underpinnings of some new asymptotic
techniques. We then quote and summarize these results in such a way that only
elementary analyses are needed to check hypotheses and carry out computations.
  The remainder of the survey focuses on combinatorial applications, such as
enumeration of words with forbidden substrings, edges and cycles in graphs,
polyominoes, and descents in permutations. After the individual examples, we
discuss three broad classes of examples, namely functions derived via the
transfer matrix method, those derived via the kernel method, and those derived
via the method of Lagrange inversion. These methods have the property that
generating functions derived from them are amenable to our asymptotic analyses,
and we describe further machinery that facilitates computations for these
classes of examples.

territory along their boundaries. Each site of the space may contain only one
representative (also referred to as a particle) of either type. The spread
mechanism for both species is the same: each particle produces offspring
independently of other particles and can place them only at the neighboring
sites that are either unoccupied, or occupied by particles of the opposite
type. In the second case, the old particle is killed by the newborn. The rate
of birth for each particle is equal to the number of neighboring sites
available for expansion. The main problem we address concerns the possibility
of the long-term coexistence of the two species. We have shown that if we start
the process with finitely many representatives of each type, then, under the
assumption that the limit set in the corresponding first passage percolation
model is uniformly curved, there is positive probability of coexistence.

cavity allows for the quantum-coherent generation of entangled light pulses on
demand. Schemes for generating simultaneous and temporally separated pulse
pairs are proposed. The mechanical effect of the laser excitation on the
quantum motion of the cold trapped atom mediates the entangling interaction
between two cavity modes and between the two subsequent pulses, respectively.
The entanglement is of EPR-type, and its degree can be controlled through
external parameters. At the end of the generation process the atom is
decorrelated from the light field. Possible experimental implementations of the
proposals are discussed.

  suplemental information in the form of one new figure and an appendix","Nature Physics, 2, 341-347 (2006)","10.1038/nphys287",,"quant-ph cond-mat.other",,"  There is growing interest to investigate states of matter with topological
order, which support excitations in the form of anyons, and which underly
topological quantum computing. Examples of such systems include lattice spin
models in two dimensions. Here we show that relevant Hamiltonians can be
systematically engineered with polar molecules stored in optical lattices,
where the spin is represented by a single electron outside a closed shell of a
heteronuclear molecule in its rotational ground state. Combining microwave
excitation with the dipole-dipole interactions and spin-rotation couplings
allows us to build a complete toolbox for effective two-spin interactions with
designable range and spatial anisotropy, and with coupling strengths
significantly larger than relevant decoherence rates. As an illustration we
discuss two models: a 2D square lattice with an energy gap providing for
protected quantum memory, and another on stacked triangular lattices leading to
topological quantum computing.

particular, if such measurements are carried over a finite period of time the
accuracy of the result is affected by the length of that period. Here I show an
upper bound on such inaccuracies and point out that the bound can be
arbitrarily small if many copies of the system are available.

under exchange of subsystems. We ask if an entanglement measure that is not
symmetric can exist. A related question is if there is a state that cannot be
swapped by means of LOCC. We show, that in general one cannot swap states by
LOCC. This allows to construct nonsymmetric measure of entanglement, and a
parameter that reports asymmetry of entanglement contents of quantum state. We
propose asymptotic measure of asymmetry of entanglement, and show that states
for which it is nonzero, contain necessarily bound entanglement.

and the subsequent retrieval, and another one for the generation of
entanglement between light and atoms. They rely on two passes of a single pulse
through the ensemble, Larmor precessing in an external field. Both protocols
work deterministically and the relevant figures of merit - such as the fidelity
or the EPR variance - scale exponentially in the coupling strength. We solve
the corresponding Maxwell-Bloch equations describing the scattering process and
determine the resulting input-output relations which only involve one relevant
light mode that, in turn, can be easily accessed experimentally.
