ULIRGs and high-z submm/mm selected galaxies for which the UV is reported to
underestimate SFRs by factors of 10-100, but similar to the average BzK-ULIRG
galaxy at z~2. The two galaxies detected at 1.2 mm are brighter in K than the
typical NIR-counterparts of MAMBO and SCUBA sources, implying also a
significantly different K-band to submm/mm flux ratio. This suggests a scenario
in which z~2 galaxies, after their rapid (sub)mm brightest phase opaque to
optical/UV light, evolve into a longer lasting phase of K-band bright and
massive objects. Targeting the most UV active BzKs could yield substantial
detection rates at submm/mm wavelengths.

inhomogeneity among light elements (e.g., C, N, O, Na, and Al) of stars on the
main sequence in the Galactic globular clusters (GCs). One of promising
interpretations for this result is that the observed abundance inhomogeneity is
due to the second generation of stars formed from ejecta of the first
generation of evolved stars (e.g., AGB stars) within GCs. However it remains
unclear whether and how this primordial pollution can occur within GCs. We here
propose a new scenario in which primordial pollution of GCs is highly likely to
occur if GCs are located in the central regions of high redshift dark matter
subhalos that can host low-mass dwarf galaxies. In this scenario, gas ejected
from the first generation of stars of GCs can be effectively trapped in the
deep gravitational potential of their host halos and consequently can be
consumed for the formation of the second generation of stars without losing a
significant amount of gas by ram pressure stripping of interstellar and
intergalactic medium. During merging of these halos with the proto-Galaxy, the
halos are completely destroyed owing to the strong tidal field of the Galaxy.
The self-polluted GCs located initially in the central regions of the halos can
survive from tidal destruction owing to their compactness and finally become
the Galactic halo GCs. In this scenario, ejecta of field stars surrounding the
central GCs can be also converted into stars within their host dwarfs and
finally become the second generation of stars of GCs. We also discuss the
origin of the difference in the degree of abundance inhomogeneity between
different GCs, such as $\omega$ Centauri and NGC 6752, in terms of the
difference in physical properties between host halos from which GC originate.

idea that the observed molecular enhancement is due to UV radiation from the HH
object. Aims. The aim of the present work is to determine whether all HH
objects with enhanced HCO$^+$ emission ahead of them also exhibit the same
enhanced chemistry as HH~2. We thus observed several molecular lines at several
positions ahead of five Herbig-Haro objects where enhanced HCO$^+$ emission was
previously observed. Methods. We mapped the five Herbig-Haro objects using the
IRAM-30 m. For each position we searched for more than one molecular species,
and where possible for more than one transition per species. We then estimated
the averaged beam column densities for all species observed and also performed
LVG analyses to constrain the physical properties of the gas. Results. The
chemically richest quiescent gas is found ahead of the HH~7-11 complex, in
particular at the HH~7-11 A position. In some regions we also detected a high
velocity gas component. We find that the gas densities are always higher than
those typical of a molecular cloud while the derived temperatures are always
quite low, ranging from 10 to 25 K. The emission of most species seems to be
enhanced with respect to that of a typical dense clump, probably due to the
exposure to a high UV radiation from the HH objects. Chemical differentiation
among the positions is also observed. We attempt a very simple chemical
analysis to explain such differentiation.

performed, from 1996 to 2003, which allowed the collection of a very large data
set, containing 10,675 photometric measurements obtained in 102 nights. The
source brightness varied in a range of about 2 mag, although the majority of
observations were performed when it was in the range 13.0 < R < 13.75.
Variability time scales were estimated from the rates of magnitude variation,
which were found to have a distribution function well fitted by an exponential
law with a mean value of 0.027 mag/h, corresponding to an e-folding time scale
of the flux tau_F = 37.6 h. The highest rates of magnitude variation were
around 0.10--0.12 mag/h and lasted less than 2 h. These rates were observed
only when the source had an R magnitude < 13.4, but this finding cannot be
considered significant because of the low statistical occurrence. The
distribution of tau_F has a well defined modal value at 19 h. Assuming the
recent estimate of the beaming factor delta about 20, we derived a typical size
of the emitting region of about 5 times 10^{16}/(1 + z) cm. The possibility to
search for a possible correlation between the mean magnitude variation rate and
the long term changes of the velocity of superluminal components in the jet is

tube is followed by numerically solving the induction equation in a comoving
Lagrangian frame, while an external poloidal magnetic field is assumed to be
radially advected onto the tube with a speed corresponding to the rise
velocity. One prediction of our model is the existence of a ring of reverse
current helicity on the periphery of active regions. On the other hand, the
amplitude of the resulting twist depends sensitively on the assumed structure
(diffuse vs. concentrated/intermittent) of the active region magnetic field
right before its emergence, and on the assumed vertical profile of the poloidal
field. Nevertheless, in the model with the most plausible choice of assumptions
a mean twist comparable to the observations can result rather naturally. Our
results indicate that the contribution of this mechanism to the twist can be
quite significant, and under favourable circumstances it can potentially
account for most of the current helicity observed in active regions.

J113155.4-123155 were carried out at various epochs using several ground based
telescopes and the HST. The frames have been deconvolved using the MCS
algorithm. A Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) + external shear has been used
to model the lensing galaxy potential.
  Results: MCS deconvolution enables us to separate the flux of the QSO

flux variations of the point-like images in various filters. The deconvolved
frames unveil several multiply imaged structures in the Einstein ring and an
unidentified object in the vicinity of the lensing galaxy. We discuss the
lightcurves and the chromatic flux ratio variations and deduce that both
intrinsic variability and microlensing took place during a span longer than one
year.
  We demonstrate that microlensing may easily account for the so called
anomalous flux ratios presented in the discovery paper. However, the observed
flux ratios are still poorly reproduced when modeling the lens potential with a
SIE+shear. We argue that this disagreement can hardly be explained by
milli-lensing caused by substructures in the lensing galaxy. A solution
proposed in Paper II consists in a more complex lens model including an
octupole term to the lens gravitational potential.

  Journal",,"10.1086/500583",,"astro-ph",,"  Various formation channels for the puzzling ultra-compact dwarf galaxies
(UCDs) have been proposed in the last few years. To better judge on some of the
competing scenarios, we present spectroscopic [Fe/H] estimates for a sample of
26 compact objects in the central region of the Fornax cluster, covering the
magnitude range of UCDs and bright globular clusters. We find a break in the
metallicity distribution of compact objects at M_V ~ -11 mag (~3*10^6 M_sun):
for M_V<-11 mag the mean metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.62 +/- 0.05 dex, 0.56 +/-
0.15 dex higher than for M_V>-11 mag. This metallicity break is accompanied by
a change in the size-luminosity relation for compact objects, as deduced from
HST-imaging: for M_V<-11 mag, r_h scales with luminosity, while for M_V>-11
mag, r_h is almost luminosity-independent. We therefore assume a limiting
absolute magnitude of M_V=-11 mag between UCDs and globular clusters. The mean
metallicity of five Fornax dE,N nuclei included in our study is about 0.8 dex
lower than that of the UCDs, at 4.5 sigma significance. Because of this large
metallicity discrepancy we disfavor the hypothesis that most of the Fornax UCDs
are the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped dE,Ns. Our metallicity estimates for
UCDs are closer to but slightly below those derived for young massive clusters
(YMCs) of comparable masses. We therefore favor a scenario where most UCDs in
Fornax are successors of merged YMCs produced in the course of violent
galaxy-galaxy mergers. It is noted that in contrast to that, the properties of
Virgo UCDs are more consistent with the stripping scenario, suggesting that
different UCD formation channels may dominate in either cluster.

a single Schechter function due to dips apparent at B ~ 17.5 (M_B ~ -19.3) and
R ~ 17.0 (M_R ~ -19.8) and the clear upturn in the counts for galaxies fainter
than B and R ~18 mag. We find, instead, that the sum of a Gaussian and a
Schechter function, for bright and faint galaxies respectively, is a suitable
representation of the data. We study the effects of the environment on the
photometric properties of galaxies, deriving the galaxy luminosity functions in
three regions selected according to the local galaxy density, and find a marked
luminosity segregation, in the sense that the LF faint-end is different at more
than 3sigma confidence level in regions with different densities. In addition,
the luminosity functions of red and blue galaxy populations show very different
behaviours: while red sequence counts are very similar to those obtained for
the global galaxy population, the blue galaxy luminosity functions are well
described by a single Schechter function and do not vary with the density. Such
large environmentally-dependent deviations from a single Schechter function are
difficult to produce solely within galaxy merging or suffocation scenarios.
Instead the data support the idea that mechanisms related to the cluster
environment, such as galaxy harassment or ram-pressure stripping, shape the
galaxy LFs by terminating star-formation and producing mass loss in galaxies at
\~M^*+2, a magnitude range where blue late-type spirals used to dominate
cluster populations, but are now absent.

we conclude that the vortex glass is, in actuality, a metal rather than a
superconductor at T=0. Our analysis unifies the recent experiments on vortex
glass systems in which the linear resistivity remained non-zero below the
putative vortex glass transition and the experiments on thin films in which a
metallic phase has been observed to disrupt the direct transition from a
superconductor to an insulator.

classified in terms of the photon-energy dependence, the coverage and the

It appears very likely that the neutralization of isolated ionic adsorbates by
photo-excited electron transfer from the substrate is the origin of the
desorption induced by ultraviolet light in ultrahigh vacuum cells. The
desorption observed in low temperature cells, on the other hand, which is
resonantly dependent on photon energy in the visible light range, is quite
similar to light-induced desorption stimulated by localized electronic
excitation on metallic aggregates. More detailed studies of light-induced
desorption events from surfaces well characterized with respect to alkali
coverage-dependent ionicity and aggregate morphology appear highly desirable
for the development of more efficient alkali atom sources suitable to improve a

the use of a boundary state, which introduces a semi-classical flat geometry on

(quasi-Heisenbeg) operators acting in the space of solutions of the
Wheeler--DeWitt equation. The Klein-Gordon normalization of the wave function
and corresponding to it quantization rules for the equation of motion allow a

relation connecting initial values of the quasi-Heisenbeg operators at $t=0$. A
stage of the inflation is considered numerically in the framework of the
Wigner--Weyl phase-space formalism. For an inflationary model of the ``chaotic
inflation'' type it is found that a dispersion of the Universe scale factor
grows during inflation, and thus, does not vanish at the inflation end. It was
found also, that the ``by hand'' introduced dependence of the cosmological
constant from the scale factor in the model with a massless scalar field leads
to the decrease of dispersion of the Universe scale factor. The measurement and

with the generic Type I and Type II seesaw mechanisms. The incompatibility of
the Type II seesaw mechanism with this MSGUT is due to its generic extreme
sub-dominance with respect to the Type I contribution. The Type I mechanism
although dominant over Type II is itself unable to provide Neutrino masses
larger than $ \sim 10^{-3}$ eV anywhere in the parameter space. Our
Renormalization Group based analysis shows the origin of these difficulties to
lie in a conflict between baryon stability and neutrino oscillation. The MSGUT
completed with a {\bf{120}}-plet Higgs is the natural next to minimal
candidate. We propose a scenario where the {\bf{120}}-plet collaborates with
the {\bf{10}}-plet to fit the charged fermion masses. The freed
{{\bf{126}}}-plet couplings can then give sub-dominant contributions to charged
fermion masses {\textit{and}} enhance the Type I seesaw masses sufficiently to
provide a viable seesaw mechanism. We give formulae required to verify this
scenario.

broken coordinate invariance leading to the appearance of the gravitational
anomalies. On the gravity side one adds the gravitational Chern-Simons term to
the bulk action which gauge invariance is only up to the boundary terms. We
analyze in detail how the gravitational anomalies originate from the modified
Einstein equations in the bulk. As a side observation we find that the
gravitational Chern-Simons functional has interesting conformal properties. It
is invariant under conformal transformations. Moreover, its metric variation
produces conformal tensor which is a generalization of the Cotton tensor to
dimension $d+1=4k-1, k\in Z$. We calculate the modification of the holographic
stress-energy tensor that is due to the Chern-Simons term and use the bulk
Einstein equations to find its divergence and thus reproduce the gravitational
anomaly. Explicit calculation of the anomaly is carried out in dimensions $d=2$
and $d=6$. The result of the holographic calculation is compared with that of
the descent method and agreement is found. The gravitational Chern-Simons term
originates by Kaluza-Klein mechanism from a one-loop modification of M-theory
action. This modification is discussed in the context of the gravitational
anomaly in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theory. The agreement with earlier
conjectured anomaly is found.

taken as axioms in the measure-theoretic approach. We also present a review of
non-Kolmogorovian probabilistic models including models with negative, complex,
and $p$-adic valued probabilities. The latter model is discussed in details.
The introduction of $p$-adic (as well as more general non-Archimedean)
probabilities is one of the main motivations for consideration of generalized
probabilities taking values in topological groups which are distinct from the
field of real numbers. We discuss applications of non-Kolmogorovian models in
physics and cognitive sciences. An important part of this paper is devoted to
statistical interpretation of probabilities taking values in topological groups
(and in particular in non-Archimedean fields).

Lebesgue equivalent to an $n$-times differentiable function ($n\geq 2$); a
simple solution in the case $n=2$ appeared in an earlier paper. For that
purpose, we introduce the notions of $CBVG_{1/n}$ and $SBVG_{1/n}$ functions,
which play analogous roles for the $n$-th order differentiability as the
classical notion of a $VBG_*$ function for the first order differentiability,
and the classes $CBV_{1/n}$ and $SBV_{{1}/{n}}$ (introduced by Preiss and
Laczkovich) for $C^n$ smoothness. As a consequence of our approach, we obtain
that Lebesgue equivalence to $n$-times differentiable function is the same as
Lebesgue equivalence to a function $f$ which is $(n-1)$-times differentiable
with $f^{(n-1)}(\cdot)$ being pointwise Lipschitz. We also characterize the
situation when a given function is Lebesgue equivalent to an $n$-times

incorporating person-level heterogeneity into behavioral models (e.g., logit
models for multiple binary outcomes as studied here). However, the logit
likelihood extended with a population distribution of heterogeneity doesn't
yield closed-form inferences, and therefore numerical integration techniques
are relied upon (e.g., MCMC methods).
  We present here an alternative, closed-form Bayesian inferences for the logit
model, which we obtain by approximating the logit likelihood via a polynomial
expansion, and then positing a distribution of heterogeneity from a flexible
family that is now conjugate and integrable. For problems where the response
coefficients are independent, choosing the Gamma distribution leads to rapidly
convergent closed-form expansions; if there are correlations among the
coefficients one can still obtain rapidly convergent closed-form expansions by
positing a distribution of heterogeneity from a Multivariate Gamma
distribution. The solution then comes from the moment generating function of
the Multivariate Gamma distribution or in general from the multivariate
heterogeneity distribution assumed.
  Closed-form Bayesian inferences, derivatives (useful for elasticity
calculations), population distribution parameter estimates (useful for
summarization) and starting values (useful for complicated algorithms) are
hence directly available. Two simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach.

two-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry. In addition, we perform a
Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the Lamb vector in order to explore its
topological features. We compare the charge with the well-known Q criterion in
order to assess its interest in detecting and characterizing coherent
structure. Usefulness of this concept in studies of vortex dynamics is
demonstrated.

  Typing errors corrected. 30 page appendix added 1st Sept 2OO9",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Astronomical measurements of the Omegas for mass density, cosmological
constant lambda and curvature k are shown to be sufficient to produce a unique
and detailed cosmological model describing dark energy influences based on the
Friedman equations. The equation of state Pressure turns out to be identically
zero at all epochs as a result of the theory. The partial omega, for dark
energy, has the exact value, minus unity, as a result of the theory and is in
exact agreement with the astronomer's measured value. Thus this measurement is
redundant as it does not contribute to the construction of the theory for this
model. Rather, the value of this omega is predicted from the theory. The model
has the characteristic of changing from deceleration to acceleration at exactly
half the epoch time at which the input measurements are taken. This is a
mysterious feature of the model for which no explanation has so far been found.
An attractive feature of the model is that the acceleration change time occurs
at a red shift of approximately 0.8 as predicted by the dark energy workers.
Using a new definition of dark energy density it is shown that the contribution
of this density to the acceleration process is via a negative value for the
gravitational constant, -G, exactly on a par with gravitational mass which
occurs via the usual positive value for G. This paper also contains an appendix
on dark energy dynamics with its own abstract.

smaller autocorrelation times for multimodal sampling densities and which
samples all peaks of multimodal structures according to their weight. The
method generates exact, i.e. uncorrelated, samples and thus gives access to
reliable error estimates. Exact tempering is applicable to arbitrary
(continuous or discreet) sampling densities and moreover presents a possibility
to calculate integrals over the density (e.g. the partition function for the
Boltzmann distribution), which are not accessible by usual MCMC.

porous saturated medium above an impermeable slope. We consider the case where
the volume of the resulting gravity current increases with time like $t^\alpha$
and show that for $\alpha<3$, at short times the current spreads
axisymmetrically, with radius $r\sim t^{(\alpha+1)/4}$, while at long times it
spreads predominantly downslope. In particular, for long times the downslope
position of the current scales like $t$ while the current extends a distance
$t^{\alpha/3}$ across the slope. For $\alpha>3$, this situation is reversed
with spreading occurring predominantly downslope for short times. The governing
equations admit similarity solutions whose scaling behaviour we determine, with
the full similarity form being evaluated by numerical computations of the
governing partial differential equation. We find that the results of these
analyses are in good quantitative agreement with a series of laboratory
experiments. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications of our work for the
sequestration of carbon dioxide in aquifers with a sloping, impermeable cap.

  Complexity Letters",,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  The emergence of mental states from neural states by partitioning the neural
phase space is analyzed in terms of symbolic dynamics. Well-defined mental
states provide contexts inducing a criterion of structural stability for the
neurodynamics that can be implemented by particular partitions. This leads to
distinguished subshifts of finite type that are either cyclic or irreducible.
Cyclic shifts correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points or limit tori
whereas irreducible shifts are obtained from generating partitions of mixing
hyperbolic systems. These stability criteria are applied to the discussion of
neural correlates of consiousness, to the definition of macroscopic neural
states, and to aspects of the symbol grounding problem. In particular, it is
shown that compatible mental descriptions, topologically equivalent to the
neurodynamical description, emerge if the partition of the neural phase space
is generating. If this is not the case, mental descriptions are incompatible or
complementary. Consequences of this result for an integration or unification of
cognitive science or psychology, respectively, will be indicated.
