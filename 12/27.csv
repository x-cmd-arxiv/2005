processes in the central region of Abell 2125. In addition to the central
triple, including members of both major dynamical subsystems identified from a
redshift survey, this region features a galaxy showing strong evidence for
ongoing gas stripping during a high-velocity passage through the gas in the
cluster core. The disk galaxy C153 exhibits a plume stretching toward the
cluster center seen in soft X-rays by Chandra, parts of which are also seen in
[O II] emission and near-UV continuum light. HST imaging shows a distorted
disk, with star-forming knots asymmetrically distributed and remnant spiral
structure possibly defined by dust lanes. The stars and ionized gas in its disk
are kinematically decoupled, demonstrating that pressure stripping must be
important, and that tidal disruption is not the only mechanism at work.
Comparison of the gas properties seen in the X-ray and optical data on the
plume highlight significant features of the history of stripped gas in the
intracluster medium. The nucleus of C153 also hosts an AGN, shown by the weak
and distorted extended radio emission and a radio compact core. The unusual
strength of the stripping signatures in this instance is likely related to the
high relative velocity of the galaxy with respect to the intracluster medium,
during a cluster/cluster merger, and its passage very near the core of the
cluster. Another sign of recent dynamical events is diffuse starlight
asymmetrically placed about the central triple in a cD envelope. Transient and
extreme dynamical events as seen in Abell 2125 may be important drivers of
galaxy evolution in the cores of rich clusters.

  than One Billionth","The Explanation to `Accelerating Expansion` is Corrected",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Gravity whose nature is fundamental to the understanding of solar system,
galaxies and the structure and evolution of the Universe, is theorized by the
assumption of curved spacetime, according to Einstein`s general theory of
relativity (EGR). Particles move on curved spacetime along straight lines
(geodesics). In the last year, I proposed the mirrored version of EGR, the
flat-spacetime general relativity (FGR), in which particles move along curved
lines on flat spacetime. This puts gravitational study back to the traditional
Lagrangian formulation. In fact, all claimed accurate verification of general
relativity is the verification of FGR, because people when confronting GR to
observational data, calculate time, distance, or angle by directly using the
coordinates in Schwarzschild solution or in post Newtonian formulation. For
example, people calculate the angles by directly using the coordinate $\phi$.
However, only when spacetime is flat does there exists one coordinate system
which has direct meaning of time, distance, angle, and vice verse. This is the
famous Riemann theorem. Therefore, the more claims are made that classical
tests of general relativity fit data with great accuracy, the more falsified is
the curved-spacetime assumption. People made three such specious claims to EGR
as collected in the present paper. However, FGR predicts observationally
verified results consistently for solar system, galaxies, and the universe on
the whole. I show that the possibility of curved spacetime, black holes, and
big bang is less than one billionth. An experiment is proposed whose results
will completely decide the fate of curved spacetime assumption. with the

were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. During the
afterglow of GRB 050502B, the largest X-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidly
above the afterglow lightcurve detected by the Swift X-ray Telescope. The peak
flux of the flare was >500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and it
occurred at >12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. The fluence of
this X-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 keV
energy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. The spectra
during the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and after
the flare. Later in time, there were additional flux increases detected above
the underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. All
evidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timing
information during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flare
was the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engine
activity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. We also find that the data
are consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which the
ejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giant
flare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thus
causing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

  Out of the 40 star forming regions surveyed in the CCS(2_{1}-1_{0}) line,
only 6 low-mass sources show CCS emission: one transitional object between
pre-stellar and protostellar Class 0 phase (GF9-2), three Class 0 protostars
(L1448-IRS3, L1448C, and B1-IRS), a Class I source (L1251A), and a young T
Tauri star (NGC2071-North). Since CCS is considered an ``early-time'' (<10E+5
yr) molecule, we explain these results by either proposing a revision of the
classification of the age of NGC2071-North and L1251A, or suggesting the
possibility that the particular physical conditions and processes of each
source affect the destruction/production of the CCS. No statistically
significant relationship was found between the presence of CCS and parameters
of the molecular outflows and their driving sources. Nevertheless, we found a
significant relationship between the detectability of CCS and the ammonia peak
intensity (higher in regions with CCS), but not with its integrated intensity.
This tendency found may suggest that the narrower ammonia line widths in the
less turbulent medium associated with younger cores may compensate for the
differences in ammonia peak intensity, rendering differences in integrated
intensity negligible. From the CCS detection rate we derive a lifetime of this
molecule of ~(0.7-3) x 10E+4 yr in low-mass star forming regions.

physically understand the anomalous behavior the height-height correlation
functions $C(r)=< |h({x_0}+r)-h(x_0)|>$ and $G(r)=< |h({x_0}+r)-h(x_0)|^2>$ are
also investigated, where the defect is located at $x_0$. The height-height
correlation functions follow the power law $C(r)\sim r^{\alpha'}$ and $G(r)\sim
r^{\alpha''}$ with $\alpha'=\alpha''=1/4$ around a perfect defect at which no
growth process is allowed. $\alpha'=\alpha''=1/4$ is the same as the anomalous
roughness exponent $\alpha=1/4$. For the weak defect at which the growth
process is partially allowed, the normal EW behavior is recovered. We also
suggest a new type queuing process based on the asymmetry $C(r) \neq C(-r)$ of
the correlation function around the perfect defect.

considering the individual particle displacement and the coarse grained
displacement field, as well as the mean packing fraction and coordination
number. We find that the displacement response is rather long ranged, and
evolves considerably with the number of cycles. We show that a small difference
in the preparation method (induced by tapping the container) leads to a
significant modification in the response though the packing fraction changes
are minute. Not only the initial response but also its further evolution change
with preparation, demonstrating that the system still retains a memory of the
initial preparation after many cycles. Nevertheless, after a sufficient number
of cycles, the displacement response for both preparation methods converges to
a nearly radial field with a 1/r decay from the perturbation source. The
observed differences between the preparation methods seem to be related to the
changes in the coordination number (which is more sensitive to the evolution of
the packing than the packing fraction). Specifically, it may be understood as
an effect of the breaking of local arches, which affects the lateral
transmission of forces.

these properties are influenced by the emergence of the Ehrenfest time scale
$\tE$. Expressed in an optimal phase-space basis, the scattering matrix
acquires a block-diagonal form as $\tE$ increases, reflecting the splitting of
the system into two cavities in parallel, a classical deterministic cavity
(with all transmission eigenvalues either 0 or 1) and a quantum mechanical
stochastic cavity. This results in the suppression of the Fano factor for
shot-noise and the deviation of sample-to-sample conductance fluctuations from
their universal value. We further present a semiclassical theory for weak
localization which captures non-ergodic phase-space structures and preserves
the unitarity of the theory. Contrarily to our previous claim [Phys. Rev. Lett.

$\mu$ is increasing, the dc conductance $G$ is found to exhibit dip, or peak,

$D0$, also neutral and with the same quark composition, is that the two quarks
have an orbital momentum 1, which increases their binding energy. Therefore the
mass is larger than that of the $D0$. Since the relative orientation of the

resonances should be the same; their small difference is predicted by theory
and therefore important to measurement to distinguish the different models.
  These states have been observed in their decay into a kaon and three pions;
two of these particles are required to originate from a displaced vertex with
respect to the primary interaction vertex, to account for the longer lifetime
of the charmed mesons. The resonances parameters have been extracted using a

experimentally the former has a rate two orders of magnitude larger than the
latter. Second, a naive estimate of the branching ratio $10^{-9}$ for the
color-suppressed three-body decay $\bar B\to\Lambda_c^+\bar\Lambda_c^-K$, which
is highly suppressed by phase space, is too small by five to six orders of
magnitude compared to experiment. We show that the great suppression for the
$\Lambda_c^+\bar\Lambda_c^-K$ production can be alleviated provided that there
exists a narrow hidden charm bound state with a mass near the
$\Lambda_c\bar\Lambda_c$ threshold. This new state that couples strongly to the
charmed baryon pair can be searched for in B decays and in $p\bar p$ collisions
by studying the mass spectrum of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or
$\Lambda_c\bar\Lambda_c$. The doubly charmful decay $\bar
B\to\Xi_c\bar\Lambda_c$ has a configuration more favorable than the singly
charmful one such as $\bar B^0\to\Lambda_c\bar p$ since no hard gluon is needed
to produce the energetic $\Xi_c\bar\Lambda_c$ pair in the former decay, while
two hard gluons are needed for the latter process. Assuming that a soft $q\bar
q$ quark pair is produced through the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges in the

the Breit-Wigner resonance model, it is not possible to achieve the detailed
reproduction of the narrow 1700 MeV total cross section peak using the standard
partial widths. We have found the new set of resonance parameters enforcing the
experimentally observed structure of the total cross section data
simultaneously with the linear dependence of the differential cross sections
with the cos(Theta) in the energy range 1650 MeV < W < 1800 MeV. The result is
that the P13 partial wave has been strongly attenuated in this model. To
understand the phenomenon, a much narrower width of a resonant state, the
N(1710) P11 in our case, is required, but then the agreement of the model
predictions with total cross section data at higher energies is lost. One way
out is to allow for the existence of the second P11 resonance in that energy
range. The same feature is shown by the polarization data. Analyzing the qqq or
qqqq(qbar) nature of the recommended narrow P11 structure in the neighbourhood
of 1700 MeV we re-open (remind of) the possibility that another P11 resonant
state exists in addition to the standard N(1710) P11 PDG-resonance, and that
one of the two states can be identified with the yet undiscovered cryptoexotic

sequence of modified approximants, involving a modified running coupling
constant, which is free from Landau singularity and much less renormalization
scheme depenedent than the conventional running coupling constant. A concrete
model of the modified coupling constant is proposed and it is shown, that the
QCD corrections to the static interquark potential evaluated with this coupling
constant are indeed much less sensitive to the scheme parameters. It is pointed
out, that the modified predictions display somewhat weaker energy dependence
compared to the conventional predictions, which may help accomodate in a

the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, the decomposition expression of
U(1) gauge field and the unified topological current for monopoles and strings
in liquid crystals are obtained. It is revealed that monopoles and strings are
located in different spatial dimensions and their topological charges are just
the winding numbers of $\phi$-mapping.

continuity of the local times for a general Markov process is still open.
Barlow and Hawkes have completely treated the case of the L\'{e}vy processes,
and Marcus and Rosen have solved the case of the strongly symmetric Markov
processes. We treat here the continuity of the local times of Borel right
processes. Our approach unifies that of Barlow and Hawkes and of Marcus and
Rosen, by using an associated Gaussian process, that appears as a limit in a
CLT involving the local time process.

condition under which the problem in question is exactly controllable in any
finite-dimensional projection. Our sufficient condition is verified for any
torus in $R^3$. The proofs are based on a development of a general approach
introduced by Agrachev and Sarychev in the 2D case. As a simple consequence of
the result on controllability, we show that the Cauchy problem for the 3D
Navier-Stokes system has a unique strong solution for any initial function and
a large class of external forces.

  measurements","24 pages",,,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  We consider a density estimation problem arising in nuclear physics. Gamma
photons are impinging on a semiconductor detector, producing pulses of current.
The integral of this pulse is equal to the total amount of charge created by
the photon in the detector, which is linearly related to the photon energy.
Because the inter-arrival of photons can be shorter than the charge collection
time, pulses corresponding to different photons may overlap leading to a
phenomenon known as pileup. The distortions on the photon energy spectrum
estimate due to pileup become worse when the photon rate increases, making
pileup correction techniques a must for high counting rate experiments. In this
paper, we present a novel technique to correct pileup, which extends a method
introduced in \cite{hall:park:2004} for the estimation of the service time from
the busy period in M/G/$\infty$ models. It is based on a novel formula linking
the joint distribution of the energy and duration of the cluster of pulses and
the distribution of the energy of the photons. We then assess the performance
of this estimator by providing an expression of its integrated square error. A
Monte-Carlo experiment is presented to illustrate on practical examples the
benefits of the pileup correction.

is equivalent to $\theta$ being a Pisot number.

synchronization properties of chaotic logistic maps, interacting with random
delay times. Four different types of topologies are investigated: two regular
(a ring-type and a ring-type with a central node) and two random (free-scale
Barabasi-Albert and small-world Newman-Watts). The influence of the network
connectivity is studied by varying the average number of links per node, while
keeping constant the total input that each map receives from its neighbors. For
weak coupling the array does not synchronize regardless the topology or
connectivity of the network; however, for certain connectivity values there is
enhanced coherence. For strong coupling the array synchronizes in the
homogeneous steady-state, where the chaotic dynamics of the individual maps is
suppressed. For both, weak and strong coupling, the array propensity for
synchronization is largely independent of the network topology and depends
mainly on the average number of links per node.

model of development of a lightning, we suggest a logical explanation of the
stepwise structure of a negative leader, intensive radio emission produced by
