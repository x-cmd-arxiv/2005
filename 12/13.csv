21 cm power spectrum are forecast assuming a flat LCDM cosmology and that the
reionization of neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium occurs below a
redshift of z=8. We find that observations with the MWA-LFD cannot constrain
the underlying cosmology in this scenario. In principle, a similar experiment
with a 10-fold increase in collecting area could provide useful constraints on
the slope of the inflationary power spectrum, n_s, and the running of the
spectral index, alpha_s, but these constraints are subject to the caveat that
even a small reionization contribution could be confused with the cosmological
signal. In addition to the redshifted 21 cm signal, we include two nuisance
components in our analysis related to the systematics and astrophysical
foregrounds present in low-frequency radio observations. These components are
found to be well separated from the signal and contribute little uncertainty
(<30%) to the measured values of the cosmological model parameters.

to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not only will such measurements
provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also
traces the distribution of matter in the Universe, this signal can be used to
constrain cosmological parameters at 6 < z < 20. The sensitivity of an
interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how
precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm 3-D power spectrum can be
measured. Utilizing an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the
effects that break the spherical symmetry of the 3-D 21 cm power spectrum and
produce physically motivated predictions for this power spectrum. We find that
upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range
of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. We consider
three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct
fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the
velocity field fluctuations in the signal, (3) looking at the signal at large
enough scales such that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the
foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately
improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain
low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a two year observation with the second
generation interferometer MWA5000 can improve constraints on Omega_w, Omega_m
h^2, Omega_b h^2, Omega_nu, n_s, and alpha_s. If the Universe is substantially
ionized by z = 12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show
that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological
parameters with any of the considered methods.

population is greater than ~300 Myr. We discuss in detail the effect on this

blue horizontal branch stars unaccounted for in the theoretical calibration,
and of statistical colour fluctuations in low mass stellar systems. In the case
of populations with multiple stellar generations, the luminosity-weighted mean
age obtained from this diagram is shown to be heavily biased towards the
youngest stellar components. We apply this method to several datasets for which
optical and near-IR photometry are available in the literature. For the two
Local Group dwarf galaxies NGC185 and NGC6822, the mean ages derived from the
integrated colours are consistent with the star formation histories inferred
independently from photometric observations of their resolved stellar
populations. A sample of bright field and Virgo cluster elliptical galaxies is
found to exhibit a range of luminosity-weighted mean ages from 3 to 14 Gyr,
with a mean of 8 Gyr, independent of environment, and mean metallicities at or
just above the solar value. Colour gradients are found in all of the galaxies

mass function at the high mass end to the shape of the cluster luminosity
function (LF). We compare the observed LFs of five galaxies containing young
star clusters with synthetic cluster population models with varying initial
conditions. The LF of the SMC, the LMC and NGC 5236 are characterized by a
power-law behavior NdL~L^-a dL, with a mean exponent of <a> = 2.0 +/- 0.2. This
can be explained by a cluster population formed with a constant cluster
formation rate, in which the maximum cluster mass per logarithmic age bin is
determined by the size-of-sample effect and therefore increases with
log(age/yr). The LFs of NGC 6946 and M51 are better described by a double
power-law distribution or a Schechter function. When a cluster population has a
mass function that is truncated below the limit given by the size-of-sample
effect, the total LF shows a bend at the magnitude of the maximum mass, with
the age of the oldest cluster in the population, typically a few Gyr due to
disruption. For NGC 6946 and M51 this implies a maximum mass of M_max = 5*10^5
M_sun. Faint-ward of the bend the LF has the same slope as the underlying
initial cluster mass function and bright-ward of the bend it is steeper. This
behavior can be well explained by our population model. We compare our results
with the only other galaxy for which a bend in the LF has been observed, the
``Antennae'' galaxies (NGC 4038/4039). There the bend occurs brighter than in
NGC 6946 and M51, corresponding to a maximum cluster mass of M_max = 2*10^6

LF can be approximated with a double power-law distribution with a break around
M_V = -8.9. On the bright side the index of the power-law distribution is
steeper (a = 2.75) than on the faint-side (a = 1.93), similar to what was found
earlier for the ``Antennae'' galaxies. The location of the bend, however,
occurs about 1.6 mag fainter in M51. We confront the observed LF with the model
for the evolution of integrated properties of cluster populations of Gieles et
al., which predicts that a truncated cluster initial mass function would result
in a bend in, and a double power-law behaviour of, the integrated LF. The
combination of the large field-of view and the high star cluster formation rate
of M51 make it possible to detect such a bend in the LF. Hence, we conclude
that there exists a fundamental upper limit to the mass of star clusters in
M51. Assuming a power-law cluster initial mass function with exponentional
cut-off of the form NdM ~ M^-b * exp(-M/M_C)dM, we find that M_C = 10^5 M_sun.
A direct comparison with the LF of the ``Antennae'' suggests that there M_C =
4*10^5 M_sun.

of both molecules shows a knotty and highly collimated structure. The SiO(8-7)
emission at the base of the outflow, close to the driving source, spans a wide
range of velocities, from -20 up to 40 km s^{-1}. This suggests that a
wide-angle wind may be the driving mechanism of the HH 211 outflow. For
distances greater than 5"" (1500 AU) from the driving source, emission from both

indicates that the SiO(8-7) emission is likely tracing entrained gas very close

the SiO(5-4) data of Hirano et al. we find that the SiO(8-7)/SiO(5-4)

transfer is used to constrain the envelope physical structure by reproducing
SCUBA 850 micron emission. Previously reported 13CO, C17O and H2CO line
observations are reproduced through detailed Monte Carlo line radiative
transfer models. It is found that the 13CO line emission is marginally
optically thick and sensitive to the physical conditions in the outer envelope.
An increased temperature in this region is needed in order to reproduce the
13CO line strengths and it is suggested to be caused by a strong heating from
the exterior, corresponding to an ISRF in Orion 10^3 times stronger than the
""standard"" ISRF. The typical temperatures in the outer envelope are higher than
the desorption temperature for CO. The C17O emission is less sensitive to this
increased temperature but rather traces the bulk envelope material. The data
are only fit by a model where CO is depleted, except in the inner and outermost
regions where the temperature increases above 30-40 K. The fact that the
temperatures do not drop below approximately 25 K in any of the envelopes
whereas a significant fraction of CO is frozen-out suggest that the
interstellar radiation field has changed through the evolution of the cores.
The H2CO lines are successfully reproduced in the model of an increased ISRF

the new observations it is essential to make accurate predictions of surface
densities and number-redshift relations for unobscured quasars in the
near-infrared based on information from surveys at shorter wavelengths. The
accuracy of the predictions depends critically on a number of key components.
The commonly used single power-law representation for quasar SEDs is inadequate
and the use of an SED incorporating the upturn in continuum flux at
lambda~12000 A is essential. The presence of quasar host galaxies is
particularly important over the restframe wavelength interval 8000 < lambda <
16000 A and we provide an empirical determination of the magnitude distribution

completely unclear, and many different theoretical models co-exist.
Nevertheless, if dark energy is produced by vacuum fluctuations then there is a
chance to probe some of its properties by simple laboratory tests based on
Josephson junctions. These electronic devices can be used to perform `vacuum
fluctuation spectroscopy', by directly measuring a noise spectrum induced by
vacuum fluctuations. One would expect to see a cutoff near 1.7 THz in the
measured power spectrum, provided the new physics underlying dark energy
couples to electric charge. The effect exploited by the Josephson junction is a
subtile nonlinear mixing effect and has nothing to do with the Casimir effect
or other effects based on van der Waals forces. A Josephson experiment of the
suggested type will now be built, and we should know the result within the next
3 years.

introduced along the cooling field or FM magnetization direction. Here we
investigate the dependence of the exchange anisotropy, loop bifurcation, and
reversal mechanism on the cooling field direction using vector magnetometry.
Three types of samples (FM=Fe, Ni /AF = FeF2, MnF2) have been studied where the
AF layer is epitaxial (110), twinned (110), and polycrystalline. With an
epitaxial AF which has one spin axis, the cooling field orients the exchange
field along the spin axis. Applying the cooling field perpendicular to the spin
axis results in bifurcated loops, whose shape evolves with the cooling field
geometry and strength. With a twinned AF where there are two orthogonal spin
axes, the exchange field direction is along the bisector of the spin axes that
encompass the cooling field. With a polycrystalline AF, the exchange field
direction is the same as the cooling field. Transverse hysteresis loops show
that when the exchange field has a component perpendicular to the applied
field, the magnetization reversal occurs by rotation in the direction of the
perpendicular component. Our results demonstrate that in fluoride films, the
exchange field is established primarily by the AF anisotropy direction, and
only to a lesser extent the cooling field or the magnetization direction. The
bifurcated loops are due to a distribution of AF anisotropies and large AF
domain sizes. Furthermore, the magnetization reversal process is extremely
sensitive to the exchange field direction.

range 900 K to 1900 K by application of semiempirical effective Lennard-Jones
(8.5-4) pair potential function and employing Gillan s algorithm to solve
Percus-Yevick equation. The potential function has been derived accurately by
application of cohesive energy density in a wide range of
pressure-density-temperature () data including data at the proximity of
absolute zero temperature. The method is very much responsive to the liquid
dynamics and leads to indication of three distinct ranges of metal, nonmetal,
and metal-nonmetal transition states. The resulted pair correlation functions
are well compared with the reported experimental and first-principle molecular
dynamic. The calculated coordination numbers in the liquid range are in
agreement with experiment particularly at low temperatures, though it is
singular at about 1400 K. This observation is similar to the change from one
liquid structure to another one and is verified by heights of the first peak of
experimental pair correlation function as a function of temperatures. At T=973
K, the position of the first peak (r=7.27 A) is in agreement well with
experimental (r=5.31 A) and with the first-principle DFT molecular dynamics
(r=5.24 A).

  Springer 08/12/2005",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In this paper, we introduce the novel use of linear spatial precoding based
on fixed and known parameters of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels
to improve the performance of space-time coded MIMO systems. We derive linear
spatial precoding schemes for both coherent (channel is known at the receiver)
and non-coherent (channel is un-known at the receiver) space-time coded MIMO
systems. Antenna spacing and antenna placement (geometry) are considered as
fixed parameters of MIMO channels, which are readily known at the transmitter.
These precoding schemes exploit the antenna placement information at both ends
of the MIMO channel to ameliorate the effect of non-ideal antenna placement on
the performance of space-time coded systems. In these schemes, the precoder is
fixed for given transmit and receive antenna configurations and transmitter
does not require any feedback of channel state information (partial or full)
from the receiver. Closed form solutions for both precoding schemes are
presented for systems with up to three receiver antennas. A generalized method
is proposed for more than three receiver antennas. We use the coherent
space-time block codes (STBC) and differential space-time block codes to
analyze the performance of proposed precoding schemes. Simulation results show
that at low SNRs, both precoders give significant performance improvement over
a non-precoded system for small antenna aperture sizes.

While the latter can be systematically improved, the assumption about a memory
loss is in general not controlled by a small expansion parameter. We determine
the range of validity of transport equations for the example of a scalar $g^2
\Phi^4$ theory. We solve the nonequilibrium time evolution using the three-loop
2PI effective action. The approximation includes off-shell and memory effects
and assumes no gradient expansion. This is compared to transport equations to
lowest order (LO) and beyond (NLO). We find that the earliest time for the
validity of transport equations is set by the characteristic relaxation time
scale $t_{\rm damp} = - 2\omega/\Sigma^{\rm (eq)}_\varrho$, where $-\Sigma^{\rm
(eq)}_\varrho/2$ denotes the on-shell imaginary-part of the self-energy. This
time scale agrees with the characteristic time for partial memory loss, but is
much shorter than thermal equilibration times. For times larger than about

Constancy of the speed of light leads to a definition of the physical radius in
terms of symmetrised traces of large powers of Lie algebra generators. These
traces, which determine the dynamics at finite N, have a surprisingly simple
form. The energy function is given by a quotient of a free multi-particle
system, where the dynamics of the individual particles are related by a simple
scaling of space and time. We show that exotic bounces of the kind seen in the
1/N expansion do not exist at finite N. The dependence of the time of collapse
on N is not monotonic. The time-dependent brane acts as a source for gravity
which, in a region of parameter space, violates the dominant energy condition.
We find regimes, involving both slowly collapsing and rapidly collapsing
branes, where higher derivative corrections to the DBI action can be neglected.
We propose some generalised symmetrised trace formulae for higher dimensional
fuzzy spheres and observe an application to D-brane charge calculations.

- Federer viewpoint. Characters are defined as equivalence classes of special
currents, called sparks, which appear naturally in the theory of singular
connections. There are many different spaces of currents which yield the
character groups. A multiplication of de Rham-Federer characters is defined
using transversality results for flat and rectifiable currents. There is a
natural equivalence of ring functors from deRham - Federer characters to
Cheeger-Simons characters. Differential characters have a topology and natural
smooth Pontrjagin duals (introduced here). A principal result is the
formulation and proof of duality for characters on oriented manifolds. It is
shown that the pairing (a,b) --> a*b([X]) given by multiplication and
evaluation on the fundamental cycle, gives an isomorphism of the group of
differential characters of degree k with the dual to characters in degree n-k-1

the fastest possible subgroup growth of any finitely generated group. This is
achieved by free non-abelian groups and is slightly faster than exponential. As
a consequence, we obtain good estimates on the number of covering spaces of a
hyperbolic 3-manifold with given covering degree. We also obtain slightly
weaker information on the number of covering spaces of closed 4-manifolds with
non-positive Euler characteristic. The results on subgroup growth follow from a
new theorem which places lower bounds on the rank of the first homology (with
mod p coefficients) of certain subgroups of a group. This is proved using a

decomposition of the logarithmic conditionally posive-definite generating
functional is constructed in a pseudo-Euclidean space, given by a quadruple
defining the monoid triangular operator representation and a cyclic zero
pseudo-norm state in this space. It is shown that the exponential
representation in the corresponding pseudo-Fock space yields the
infinitely-divisible generating functional with respect to the exponential

infinitly-divisible representation associated with the Fock vacuum state. The
structure of states on an arbitrary Ito algebra is studied with two canonical
examples of quantum Wiener and Poisson states. A generalized quantum stochastic
nonadapted multiple integral is explicitly defined in Fock scale, its
continuity and quantum stochastic differentiability is proved. A unified
non-adapted and functional quantum Ito formula is discovered and established

the PNC $\rho NN$ and $\omega NN$ couplings of a single-meson-exchange model of
the PNC $NN$ force. The analysis of the experimental data at 13.6, 45 and 221
MeV simultaneously has been performed by Carlson \textit{et al.}, who concluded
to an agreement with the original DDH estimates for the PNC meson-nucleon
couplings. In this work, it is shown first that the comparison with updated
hadronic predictions of these couplings rather suggests the existence of some
discrepancy for the PNC $\omega NN$ coupling. The effect of variations on the
strong coupling constants and introduction of cutoffs in the one-boson-exchange
weak potential is then investigated. As expected, it turns out that the
resulting asymmetry is quite sensitive to these parameters regardless of the
energy. However the above discrepancy persists. The dependence of this
conclusion on various ingredients entering an improved description of the PNC
$NN$ force is also examined. These include the two-pion resonance nature of the
rho meson and some momentum dependence of the isoscalar PNC $\rho NN$ vertex.
It is found that none of these corrections is able to remove or even alleviate
the above discrepancy. Their impacts on the theoretical determination of the
vector meson-nucleon couplings, the description of the PNC force in terms of
single-meson exchanges, or the interpretation of measurements, are finally
examined.

This research establishes an operational measurement way to express the great
theory in a geometrical form. This may be valuable for understanding the
underlying concepts of relativity theory. In four-dimensional spacetime
continuum, the displacement field of matter motion is measurable quantities.
Based on these measurements, a finite geometrical field can be established. On
this sense, the matter motion in physics is viewed as the deformation of
spacetime continuum. Suppose the spacetime continuum is isotropic, based on the
least action principle, the general motion equations can be established. In
this part, Newton motion and special relativity are discussed. Based on the
finite geometrical field theory of matter motion, the Newton motion equation
and the special relativity can be derived simply based on the isotropy of
spacetime continuum and the definition of inertial system. This research shows
that the Lorentz transformation is required by both of the inertial system
definition and the time gauge invariance for inertial systems. Hence, the
special relativity is the logic conclusion of time invariance in inertial
system. The source independent of light velocity supports the isotropy of
inertial system rather than the concept of proper time, which not only causes
many paradox, such as the twin-paradox, but also causes many misunderstanding
and controversial arguments. The singularity of Lorentz transformation is
removed in other parts of finite geometrical field theory, where the gravity

amplifying the yhbO gene from E. coli by polymerase chain reaction. It was
inserted in the expression plasmid pET-21a, under the transcriptional control
of the bacteriophage T7 promoter and lac operator. A BL21(DE3) E. coli strain
transformed with the YhbO-expression vector pET-21a-yhbO, accumulates large
amounts of a soluble protein of 20 kDa in SDS-PAGE that matches the expected
YhbO molecular weight. YhbO was purified to homogeneity by HPLC DEAE ion
exchange chromatography and hydroxylapatite chromatography and its identity was
confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis. The native
protein exists in monomeric, trimeric and hexameric forms.

rather than a ``constructive'' theory about the dynamics of quantum systems.
Here we criticize Bub's principle approach arguing that if the mathematical
formalism of quantum mechanics remains intact then there is no escape route
from solving the measurement problem by constructive theories. We further
propose a (Wigner--type) thought experiment that we argue demonstrates that
quantum mechanics on the information--theoretic approach is incomplete.

that the problem admits a solution in the form of an eigenvalue problem of a

intercommuting macroscopic observables and, most crucially, their
dimensionalities are astronomically large, increasing exponentially with the
number, N, of particles comprising I. We formulate conditions under which the
conservative dynamics of S_{c} yields both a reduction of the wave packet
describing the state of S and a one-to-one correspondence, following a
measurement, between the pointer position of I and the resultant eigenstate of
S; and we show that these conditions are fulfilled, up to utterly negligible
corrections that decrease exponentially with N, by the finite version of the
