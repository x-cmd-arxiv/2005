observed and simulated characteristics of the gas motions.
  Method: Using a dataset of vibrationally excited H2 emission in OMC1
containing radial velocity and brightness which covers scales from 70AU to
30000AU, we present the transversal structure functions and the scaling of the
structure functions with their order. These are compared with the predictions
of two-dimensional projections of simulations of supersonic hydrodynamic
turbulence.
  Results: The structure functions of OMC1 are not well represented by power
laws, but show clear deviations below 2000AU. However, using the technique of
extended self-similarity, power laws are recovered at scales down to 160AU. The
scaling of the higher order structure functions with order deviates from the
standard scaling for supersonic turbulence. This is explained as a selection
effect of preferentially observing the shocked part of the gas and the scaling
can be reproduced using line-of-sight integrated velocity data from subsets of
supersonic turbulence simulations. These subsets select regions of strong flow
convergence and high density associated with shock structure. Deviations of the
structure functions in OMC1 from power laws cannot however be reproduced in
simulations and remains an outstanding issue.

Spitzer/IRS spectra of two z~1.3 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (LFIR~10^13)

Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS). MIPS J142824.0+352619 is a bright 160 micron source
with a large infrared-to-optical flux density ratio and a possible lensing
amplification of <~10. The 6.2, 7.7, 11.3, and 12.8 micron PAH emission bands
in its IRS spectrum indicate a redshift of z~1.3. The large equivalent width of
the 6.2 micron PAH feature indicates that at least 50% of the mid-infrared
energy is generated in a starburst, an interpretation that is supported by a
large [NeII]/[NeIII] ratio and a low upper limit on the X-ray luminosity. SST24
J142827.19+354127.71 has the brightest 24 micron flux (10.55 mJy) among
optically faint (R > 20) galaxies in the NDWFS. Its mid-infrared spectrum lacks
emission features, but the broad 9.7 micron silicate absorption band places
this source at z~1.3. Given this redshift, SST24 J142827.19+354127.71 has among
the largest rest-frame 5 micron luminosities known. The similarity of its SED
to those of known AGN-dominated ULIRGs and its lack of either PAH features or
large amounts of cool dust indicate that the powerful mid-infrared emission is
dominated by an active nucleus rather than a starburst. Our results illustrate
the power of the IRS in identifying massive galaxies in the ``redshift desert''
and in discerning their power sources. Because they are bright, MIPS
J142824.0+352619 (pending future observations to constrain its lensing
amplification) and SST24 J142827.19+354127.71 are useful z>1 templates of a

magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in the Kerr metric to
investigate the properties of the unbound outflows that result. The overall
strength of these outflows increases sharply with increasing black hole
rotation rate, but a number of generic features are found in all cases. The
mass in the outflow is concentrated in a hollow cone whose opening angle is
largely determined by the effective potential for matter orbiting with angular
momentum comparable to that of the innermost stable circular orbit. The
dominant force accelerating the matter outward comes from the pressure of the
accretion disk's corona. The principal element that shapes the outflow is
therefore the centrifugal barrier preventing accreting matter from coming close
to the rotation axis. Inside the centrifugal barrier, the cone contains very
little matter and is dominated by electromagnetic fields that rotate at a rate
tied closely to the rotation of the black hole. These fields carry an
outward-going Poynting flux whose immediate energy source is the rotating
spacetime of the Kerr black hole. When the spin parameter a/M of the black hole
exceeds ~0.9, the energy carried to infinity by these outflows can be
comparable to the nominal radiative efficiency predicted in the Novikov-Thorne
model. Similarly, the expelled angular momentum can be comparable to that
accreted by the black hole. Both the inner electromagnetic part and the outer
matter part can contribute in significant fashion to the energy and angular
momentum of the outflow.

large sample of 1015 galaxies with both morphological and spectral information.
Among these, 385 sources are classified as star-forming galaxies and the SDSS
fibre covered the circumnuclear regions (0.2 $-$ 2.0 kpc). By using the
spectral synthesis method to remove the contribution from the underlying old
stellar population, we measure the emission lines fluxes accurately which are
then used to estimate the star formation rates(SFRs). Our main findings are
that: (1) Early-type spirals show much larger H$\alpha$ luminosities and hence
higher SFRs, they also suffer more extinctions than late-type ones. The
equivalent widths (EWs) of H$\alpha$ emission lines show the similar trend,
however, the very late types (Sdm $\sim$ Irr) do have large fractions of high
EWs. (2) We confirm that D$_n(4000)$ has strong correlation with the strengthes
of metallic absorption lines (such as CN band, G band and Mg Ib). Both these
lines and the Balmer absorption lines show interesting variations between Sbc
to Sd type galaxies. (3) The bar structure tightly relates with the enhanced
star forming activity, this effect is even more significant in the early-type
spirals. But we should note that the bar structure is not a necessary or
sufficient condition for galaxies to harbor circumnuclear star formations.

the broadband optical and infrared spectro-photometry. We explore variations in
the key parameters that are able to lower the predicted visibility amplitudes
to the measured levels, and conclude that accretion disks alone do not
reproduce the spectral energy distributions and K-band visibilities
simultaneously. We conclude that either disk models are inadequate to describe
the near-infrared emission, or additional source components are needed. We
hypothesize that large scale emission (10s of AU) in the interferometer field
of view is responsible for the surprisingly low visibilities. This emission may
arise in scattering by large envelopes believed to surround these objects.

Therefore, we present the acceptances of horizontal (HAS) and upgoing (UAS) air

10^(-30) cm^2. The dependences of acceptances on neutrino energy,
shower-threshold energy, shower length and column density, and cloud layers are
also studied. For UAS, we present acceptances for events over land (rock), and
over the ocean (water). The latter are larger by about an order of magnitude,
thus favoring space-based detectors. We revisit the idea of Kusenko and Weiler
to infer sigma_nuN at E_nu ~ 10^20 eV from the ratio of HAS-to-UAS events, and
find favorable results. Our calculation is mostly analytic. Included in the UAS
calculation are realistic energy-losses for taus, and Earth-curvature effects.

of such geometry is still controversial. There are indications that it may be
carried over from an earlier phase of stellar evolution, such as the AGB phase.
But how early in the star's evolution does the non-spherical envelope appear?
Li-rich giants show dusty circumstellar envelopes that can help answer that
question. We study a sample of fourteen Li-rich giants using optical
polarimetry in order to detect non-spherical envelopes around them. We used the
IAGPOL imaging polarimeter to obtain optical linear polarization measurements
in V band. Foreground polarization was estimated using the field stars in each
CCD frame. After foreground polarization was removed, seven objects presented
low intrinsic polarization (0.19 - 0.34)% and two (V859 Aql and GCSS 557)
showed high intrinsic polarization values (0.87 - 1.16)%. This intrinsic
polarization suggests that Li-rich giants present a non-spherical distribution
of circumstellar dust. The intrinsic polarization level is probably related to
the viewing angle of the envelope, with higher levels indicating objects viewed
closer to edge-on. The correlation of the observed polarization with optical
color excess gives additional support to the circumstellar origin of the
intrinsic polarization in Li-rich giants. The intrinsic polarization correlates
even better with the IRAS 25 microns far infrared emission. Analysis of
spectral energy distributions for the sample show dust temperatures for the
envelopes tend to be between 190 and 260 K. We suggest that dust scattering is
indeed responsible for the optical intrinsic polarization in Li-rich giants.
Our findings indicate that non-spherical envelopes may appear as early as the
red giant phase of stellar evolution.

acceleration of electrons up to ~ 60 TeV, the jet power is ~ 4x10^35 erg s^-1,

experienced an active phase by capturing a red giant star and forming an
accretion disk, temporarily behaving like an active galactic nucleus. A
powerful jet, which contains plenty of high speed protons, was launched during
the process. These runaway protons interact with the dense ambient medium,
producing TeV $\gamma$-ray emission through the $\pi^0$-decay process. We show
that the total energy deposited in this way is large enough to account for
observations. The diffusion length of protons is also consistent with the
observed size of the TeV source.

fractal dimension and associate each clump with a maximum in the resulting
density field. Then, we discuss the effect that different criteria for clump
selection has on the derived global properties. We calculate the masses, sizes
and average densities of the clumps as a function of the fractal dimension
(D_f) and the fraction of the total mass in the form of clumps (epsilon). In
general, clump mass does not fulfill a simple power law with size of the type
M_cl ~ (R_cl)**(gamma), instead the power changes, from gamma ~ 3 at small
sizes to gamma<3 at larger sizes. The number of clumps per logarithmic mass
interval can be fitted to a power law N_cl ~ (M_cl)**(-alpha_M) in the range of
relatively large masses, and the corresponding size distribution is N_cl ~
(R_cl)**(-alpha_R) at large sizes. When all the mass is forming clumps
(epsilon=1) we obtain that as D_f increases from 2 to 3 alpha_M increases from
~0.3 to ~0.6 and alpha_R increases from ~1.0 to ~2.1. Comparison with
observations suggests that D_f ~ 2.6 is roughly consistent with the average
properties of the ISM. On the other hand, as the fraction of mass in clumps
decreases (epsilon<1) alpha_M increases and alpha_R decreases. When only ~10%
of the complex mass is in the form of dense clumps we obtain alpha_M ~ 1.2 for
D_f=2.6 (not very different from the Salpeter value 1.35), suggesting this a
likely link between the stellar initial mass function and the internal
structure of molecular cloud complexes.

appearance of ""peanuts"" and ""X""-like features with the edge-on profiles of
three disc galaxies (IC 2531, NGC 4013 and UGC 2048). The subtraction from the

observed main morphological features of the residuals. We also apply a simple
unsharp masking technique in order to study the sharpest features of the

these galaxies can be explained by considering disc material trapped around
stable 3D periodic orbits. In most models these building-blocks periodic orbits
are bifurcated from the planar central family of a non-axisymmetric component,
usually a bar, at low order vertical resonances. In such a case the boxy
""bulges"" are parts of bars seen edge-on. For the three galaxies we study the

bifurcations at the vertical 2/1 or 4/1 resonance.

(RT) applications often leads to important breakthroughs in astrophysics,
because they allow the investigation of problems that could not be properly
tackled using the methods previously available. Probably, the most familiar
example is the so-called Multilevel Accelerated $\Lambda$-Iteration (MALI)
technique of Rybicki & Hummer for the case of a local approximate operator,
which is based on Jacobi iteration. However, there are superior
operator-splitting methods, based on Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Successive
Overrelaxation (SOR) iteration, which provide a dramatic increase in the speed
with which non-LTE multilevel transfer problems can be solved in one, two and
three-dimensional geometries. Such RT methods, which were introduced by
Trujillo Bueno & Fabiani Bendicho ten years ago, are the main subject of the
first part of this paper. We show in some detail how they can be applied for
solving multilevel RT problems in spherical geometry, for both atomic and
molecular line transitions. The second part of the article addresses the issue
of the calculation of the molecular number densities when the approximation of
instantaneous chemical equilibrium turns out to be inadequate, which happens to
be the case whenever the dynamical time scales of the astrophysical plasma
under consideration are much shorter than the time needed by the molecules to
form.

critical field $H_{\textrm{c1}}$ for which the associated errors are neglected.
We show that when these errors are included, the uncertainty in the obtained
exponent is so large that the available experimental data cannot be used to
differentiate between contending universality classes.

single donor electron wave function and the two-electron pair wave function. We
adopted a molecular orbital method for the two-electron problem, forming a
basis with the calculated single donor electron orbitals. Our two-electron
basis contains many singlet and triplet orbital excited states, in addition to
the two simple ground state singlet and triplet orbitals usually used in the
Heitler-London approximation to describe the two-electron donor pair wave
function. We determined the excitation spectrum of the two-donor system, and
study its dependence on strain, lattice position and inter donor separation.
This allows us to determine how isolated the ground state singlet and triplet

calculating the energy spectrum, we are also able to evaluate the exchange
coupling between the two donor electrons, and the double occupancy probability
that both electrons will reside on the same P donor. These two quantities are
very important for logical operations in solid-state quantum computing devices,

allows to enlighten important quantitative and qualitative deviations from the
limiting treatments of small polaron theory, that should be considered when
interpreting experimental data. In the antiadiabatic regime, accounting on the
same footing for a finite phonon frequency and a finite electron bandwidth
allows to address the evolution of the optical absorption away from the
well-understood molecular limit. It is shown that the width of the multiphonon
peaks in the optical spectra depends on the temperature and on the frequency in
a way that contradicts the commonly accepted results, most notably in the
strong coupling case. In the adiabatic regime, on the other hand, the present
method allows to identify a wide range of parameters of experimental interest,
where the electron bandwidth is comparable or larger than the broadening of the
Franck-Condon line, leading to a strong modification of both the position and
the shape of the polaronic absorption. An analytical expression is derived in
the limit of vanishing broadening, which improves over the existing formulas
and whose validity extends to any finite-dimensional lattice. In the same
adiabatic regime, at intermediate values of the interaction strength, the
optical absorption exhibits a characteristic reentrant behavior, with the
emergence of sharp features upon increasing the temperature -- polaron
interband transitions -- which are peculiar of the polaron crossover, and for
which analytical expressions are provided.

has been argued that a wave function of the Universe should satisfy a
Schrodinger equation. Its form, as well as a measure in Schrodinger scalar
product, depends on a gauge condition (a chosen reference frame). It is known
that the geometry of an appropriate Hilbert space is determined by introducing
the scalar product, so the Hilbert space structure turns out to be in a large
degree depending on a chosen gauge condition. In the present work we analyse
this issue from the viewpoint of the path integral approach. We consider how
the gauge condition changes as a result of gauge transformations. In this
respect, three kinds of gauge transformations can be singled out: Firstly,
there are residual gauge transformations, which do not change the gauge
condition. The second kind is the transformations whose parameters can be
related by homotopy. Then the change of gauge condition could be described by
smoothly changing function. In particular, in this context time dependent
gauges could be discussed. We also suggest that this kind of gauge
transformations leads to a smooth changing of solutions to the Schrodinger
equation. The third kind of the transformations includes those whose parameters
belong to different homotopy classes. They are of the most interest from the
viewpoint of changing the Hilbert space structure. In this case the gauge
condition and the very form of the Schrodinger equation would change in
discrete steps when we pass from a spacetime region with one gauge condition to
another region with another gauge condition. In conclusion we discuss the
relation between quantum gravity and fundamental problems of ordinary quantum
mechanics.

give good solution while matter closes to black hole. Our simulations
illustrate that the spiral shock waves are created close to black hole and the

superconducting dipole magnet and can measure ellipticity and rotation induced
by the magnetic field onto linearly polarized light. The sensitivity of the
instrument is about 10-7rad Hz-1/2. With a residual pressure less than 10-7mbar
the apparatus gives both ellipticity and rotation signals at the 10-7rad level
with more than 8 sigma sob ratio in runs that last about 1000sec. These signals
can be interpreted as beeing generated largely by vacuum ellipticity and
dichroism induced by the transverse magnetic field.If this interpretation is
correct, a tool has become available to characterize physical properties of
vacuum as if it were an ordinary transparent medium. A microscopic effect
responsible for this induced dichroism could be the existence of ultralight
spin zero bosons with mass of the order of 10-3eV, that would couple to two
photons and would be created in the experiment by interaction of photons of the
laser beam with virtual photons of the magnetic field. The inverse of the
coupling constant to two photons would correspond to a mass M of the order of
10+6GeV.

of fundamental interest in itself, collisions between photons are believed to
be of importance in the vicinity of magnetars, in the present generation
intense lasers, and in intense laser-plasma/matter interactions; the latter
recreating astrophysical conditions in the laboratory. We show that an intense
photon pulse propagating through a radiation gas can self-focus, and under
certain circumstances collapse. This is due to the response of the radiation
background, creating a potential well in which the pulse gets trapped, giving
rise to photonic solitary structures. When the radiation gas intensity has
reached its peak values, the gas releases part of its energy into `photon
wedges', similar to Cherenkov radiation. The results should be of importance
for the present generation of intense lasers and for the understanding of

many string axions combine to drive inflation. We characterize the dynamics of
a general N-flation model with non-degenerate axion masses. Although the
precise mass of a single axion depends on compactification details in a
complicated way, the distribution of masses can be computed with very limited
knowledge of microscopics: the shape of the mass distribution is an emergent
property. We use random matrix theory to show that a typical N-flation model
has a spectrum of masses distributed according to the Marchenko-Pastur law.
This distribution depends on a single parameter, the number of axions divided
by the dimension of the moduli space. We use this result to describe the
inflationary dynamics and phenomenology of a general N-flation model. We
produce an ensemble of models and use numerical integration to track the
axions' evolution and the resulting scalar power spectrum. For realistic
initial conditions, the power spectrum is considerably more red than in
single-field $m^2\phi^2$ inflation. We conclude that random matrix models of
N-flation are surprisingly tractable and have a rich phenomenology that differs
in testable ways from that of single-field $m^2\phi^2$ inflation.

general scattering environments. In contrast to the existing correlation
models, our new approach treats the scattering environment as non-separable and
it is modeled using a bi-angular power distribution. The bi-angular power
distribution is parameterized by the mean departure and arrival angles, angular
spreads of the univariate angular power distributions at the transmitter and
receiver apertures, and a third parameter, the covariance between transmit and
receive angles which captures the statistical interdependency between angular
power distributions at the transmitter and receiver apertures. When this third
parameter is zero, this new model reduces to the well known ""Kronecker"" model.
Using the proposed model, we show that Kronecker model is a good approximation
to the actual channel when the scattering channel consists of a single
scattering cluster. In the presence of multiple remote scattering clusters we
show that Kronecker model over estimates the performance by artificially
increasing the number of multipaths in the channel.

space with $\alpha\in(0,2)$ can be represented as a sum of points of a Poisson
process. This point process is union-stable, i.e. the union of its two
independent copies coincides in distribution with the rescaled original point
process. These concepts makes sense in any convex cone, i.e. in a commutative
semigroup equipped with multiplication by numbers, and lead to a construction
of stable laws in general cones by means of the LePage series. The
corresponding limit theorem shows that random samples (or binomial point
processes) converge in distribution to the union-stable Poisson point process,
and so yields a limit theorem for normalised sums of random elements with
$\alpha$-stable limit for $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
  By using the technique of harmonic analysis on semigroups we characterise
distributions of $\alpha$-stable random elements and show how possible values
of $\alpha$ relate to the properties of the semigroup and the corresponding

properties of the self-consistent mean-field Hamiltonian onto an effective

consider the sd-shell nuclei Ne-20, Mg-24, Si-28, and Ar-36. Our first
application is in the framework of the USD shell-model Hamiltonian, using its
mean-field approximation to construct an effective Hamiltonian and partially
recover correlation effects. We find that more than half of the correlation
energy is due to the quadrupole interaction. We then follow a similar procedure
but using the SLy4 Skyrme energy functional as our starting point and
truncating the space to the spherical $sd$ shell. The constructed shell-model
Hamiltonian is found to satisfy minimal consistency requirements to reproduce
the properties of the mean-field solution. The quadrupolar correlation energies
computed with the mapped Hamiltonian are reasonable compared with those

solved by applying the fundamental solution $\exp(-itH)$ to the initial field

is used to develop a numerical algorithm for propagation of broad band wave

$\Psi$ is approximated by the Fourier grid pseudospectral method. The algorithm
is global in time, meaning that the entire propagation can be carried out in
just a few time steps. A typical time step is much larger than that in finite
differencing schemes, $\Delta t_F \gg \|H\|^{-1}$. The accuracy and stability
of the algorithm is analyzed. The Faber propagation method is compared with the
Lanczos-Arnoldi propagation method with an example of scattering of broad band
laser pulses on a periodic grating made of a dielectric whose dispersive
properties are described by the Rocard-Powels-Debye model. The Faber algorithm
is shown to be more efficient. The Courant limit for time stepping, $\Delta t_C

Our formalism is applied to the CW and pulsed schemes. We explicitly calculate
the Wigner function of the conditional non-Gaussian output state in a realistic

of modes becomes prominant, and only a few modes become dominant both in the

corresponding control is periodic with frequency of the order of the resonance
frequency $\omega_R=2E$. On the other side, for $M/E>1$, the time optimal

A, 73, 052108 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.052108",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider n identically prepared qubits and study the asymptotic properties
of the joint state \rho^{\otimes n}. We show that for all individual states
\rho situated in a local neighborhood of size 1/\sqrt{n} of a fixed state
\rho^0, the joint state converges to a displaced thermal equilibrium state of a
quantum harmonic oscillator. The precise meaning of the convergence is that
there exist physical transformations T_{n} (trace preserving quantum channels)
which map the qubits states asymptotically close to their corresponding
oscillator state, uniformly over all states in the local neighborhood.
  A few consequences of the main result are derived. We show that the optimal
joint measurement in the Bayesian set-up is also optimal within the pointwise
approach. Moreover, this measurement converges to the heterodyne measurement
which is the optimal joint measurement of position and momentum for the quantum
oscillator. A problem of local state discrimination is solved using local
asymptotic normality.
