  Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J.638:262-280,2006","10.1086/498734",,"astro-ph",,"  We continue our numerical analysis of the morphological and energetic
influence of massive stars on their ambient interstellar medium for a 35 solar
mass star that evolves from the main sequence through red supergiant and
Wolf-Rayet phases, until it ultimately explodes as a supernova. We find that
structure formation in the circumstellar gas during the early main-sequence
evolution occurs as in the 60 solar mass case but is much less pronounced
because of the lower mechanical wind luminosity of the star. Since on the other
hand the shell-like structure of the HII region is largely preserved, effects
that rely on this symmetry become more important. At the end of the stellar
lifetime 1% of the energy released as Lyman continuum radiation and stellar
wind has been transferred to the circumstellar gas. From this fraction 10% is
kinetic energy of bulk motion, 36% is thermal energy, and the remaining 54% is
ionization energy of hydrogen. The sweeping up of the slow red supergiant wind
by the fast Wolf-Rayet wind produces remarkable morphological structures and
emission signatures, which are compared with existing observations of the
Wolf-Rayet bubble S308. Our model reproduces the correct order of magnitude of
observed X-ray luminosity, the temperature of the emitting plasma as well as
the limb brightening of the intensity profile. This is remarkable, because
current analytical and numerical models of Wolf-Rayet bubbles fail to
consistently explain these features. A key result is that almost the entire
X-ray emission in this stage comes from the shell of red supergiant wind swept
up by the shocked Wolf-Rayet wind rather than from the shocked Wolf-Rayet wind
itself as hitherto assumed and modeled. This offers a possible solution to what
is called the ``missing wind problem'' of Wolf-Rayet bubbles.

observationally to be anticorrelated to their luminosity Lx. This recently
found evidence is used to investigate the location of the absorbing gas. The
molecular torus invoked in the unified picture of AGN, while it can be regarded
as confirmed on several grounds to explain the Compton-thick objects, do not
conform to this new constraint, at least in its physical models as developed so
far. In the frame of observationally based evidence that in Compton-thin
sources the absorbing gas might be located far away from the X-ray source, it
is shown that the gravitational effects of the black hole (BH) on the molecular
gas in a disk, within 25-450 pc (depending on the BH mass, from 10^6 to 10^9
M_solar, leads naturally to the observed anticorrelation, under the assumption
of a statistical correlation between the BH mass and Lx. Its normalization is
also reproduced provided that the surface density, Sigma, of this gas is larger
than about 150-200 M_solar pc^{-2}, and assuming that the bolometric luminosity
is one tenth of the Eddington limit. Interestingly, the required values are
consistent with the value of the 300 pc molecular disk in our own galaxy,
namely 500 M_solar pc^{-2}. In a sample of nearby galaxies from the BIMA SONG
survey, it is found that half of the objects have central Sigma larger than 150
M_solar pc${-2}. Given the simplicity of the proposed model, this finding is
very encouraging, waiting for future higher resolution surveys in CO on more

advantage by focussing on subsets of the multipole configurations, where the
non-Gaussian signal is more concentrated. The detection power of the test,
increases roughly linearly with the maximum multipole, as shown in the ideal
case of an experiment without noise and gaps. The CPU-time scales as l_{max}^3
instead of l_{max}^5 for the full bispectrum which for Planck resolution
l_{max} \sim 3000 means an improvement in speed of a factor 10^7 compared to
the full bispectrum analysis with minor loss in precision. We find that the
introduction of a galactic cut partially destroys the optimality of the

an ideal experiment with l_{max}=2000 that upper limits of f_{NL}<8 can be
obtained at 1 sigma. For the case of the WMAP experiment, we would be able to
put limits of |f_{NL}|<40 if no galactic cut were present. Using the real data

l_{in} less than about a few kpc have a more luminous inner double than the

the jets propagate through the dense interstellar medium. We have examined the

to coincide with the first flypast of Rhea by the Cassini Orbiter spacecraft on
26 November 2005. It is proposed that these moons had condensed from a
concentric family of orbiting gas rings that were cast off some 4600 Myr ago by
the contracting proto-Saturnian cloud. Numerical and structural models for Rhea
are constructed on the basis of a computed bulk chemical mix of hydrated rock
(mass fraction 0.385), H2O ice (0.395), and NH3 ice (0.220). The large
proportion of NH3 in the ice mass inhibits the formation of the dense
crystalline phase II of H2O ice at the satellite's centre. This may explain the
absence of compressional features on the surface. The favoured model of Rhea
has a chemically uniform interior and is very cold. The satellite is nearly
isodense and the predicted value of the axial moment-of-inertia factor is
C/MR^2 = 0.399 +/- 0.004. NH3 is unstable at Saturn's distance from the Sun,
except near the polar regions of the satellite. Perhaps the Cassini Orbiter
will discover indirect evidence for NH3 through the sublimative escape of this
ice from the outer layers, especially near the equatorial zones. Wasting of NH3
would weaken the residual soil, so making the edges of craters soft and prone
to landslides. It will be exciting to learn what Cassini discovers.

be the seed black holes for the many supermassive black holes found in galaxies

black holes may be a prime signal for long wavelength gravitational wave
detectors. We simulate formation of black holes in the center of high redshift
dark matter halos and explore implications of initial natal kick velocities
conjectured by some formation models. The central concentration of early black
holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they are born even with moderate
kicks of tens of km/s. The modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their
parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less
effective on the lower mass black holes as compared to those still embedded in
their parent halos. Therefore, merger rates may be reduced by more than an
order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N--body
simulations we quantify the role of natal kicks of black holes formed from
massive metal free stars on their merger rates with supermassive black holes in
present day galaxies. Our results also apply to black holes ejected by the

us with a self-consistent toy-model for predicted lightcurves, including the
linear polarization that arises from the scattering. Strong gravitational
lensing creates indirect images; these are formed by photons that originate
from the disk, get backscattered onto the photon circular orbit and eventually
redirected towards an observer. Under suitable geometrical conditions the

red galaxy sequence they are unlikely to affect more than 10% of the blue
galaxy sequence. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z=0.1 from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey to that at z=1 from the Deep Extragalactic
Evolutionary Probe 2. Galaxies are bluer at z=1: the blue sequence by about 0.3
mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag, in redshift z=0.1 (u-g) color. I
evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two
sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These
models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than
passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue
progenitors, ``dry'' mergers betweeen red galaxies then must create the
luminous red population at z=0.1, if stellar population models are correct. The
blue sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in
the star-formation rate since redshift z=1 by a factor of about three, with no
change in the number density to within 10%. These results restrict the number
of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in
particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events they must be rare
for blue galaxies.

Heretofore, calculations of the Roche lobe geometry beyond the Newtonian case

by Damour and Schaffer, we develop the Lagrangian for a test particle in the
vicinity of two massive compact objects. As an exact result for the

calculate the Roche lobe volumes, and provide a simple fitting formula for the
effective Roche lobe radius analogous to that for the Newtonian case furnished

radius depends only upon the mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2$, in the 2PN case the

bursters. In addition, they represent an important, and possibly unique,
observable that could distinguish between normal and self--bound neutron stars.
These two families of stars have distinctly different mass--radius
relationships resulting from their equations of state which can be revealed
during their mergers if stable mass transfer ensues. We consider two cases of
gravitational-radiation induced binary mergers: (i) a black hole and a normal
neutron star, and (ii) a black hole and a self-bound strange quark matter star.
We extend previous Newtonian analyses to incorporate the pseudo-general
relativistic Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential or a potential correct to
second--order post-Newtonian order in Arnowitt--Deser--Misner coordinates.
These potentials are employed to study both the orbital evolution of the binary
and the Roche lobe geometry that determines when and if stable mass transfer
between the components is possible. The Roche lobe geometry with pseudo-general
relativistic or post-Newtonian potentials has not heretofore been considered.
Our analysis shows that differences in the evolution of normal neutron stars
and strange quark matter stars are significant and could be detected in gravity
waves. Both the amplitude and frequencies of the wave pattern are affected. In
addition, details of the equation of state for either normal neutron stars or
strange quark stars may be learned. A single merger could reveal one or two

fractions of objects must have undergone similar processes, underlining the
importance of (minor) accretion for galaxy evolution. Applications of gas
counter-rotators to barred galaxy dynamics are also discussed.

the local value and do not show any trend with redshift. We do not see evidence
of evolution from z=0 to z_m ~ 0.6 suggesting that the population of local
bright galaxies was already formed at z<0.8. On the contrary, we clearly detect
an evolution of the LF to z_m ~ 1.2 characterized by a brightening of M* and by
a decline of phi*. To z_m ~ 1.2 M* brightens by about 0.4-0.6 mag and phi*
decreases by a factor 2-3. This trend persists, even if at a less extent, down
to z_m ~ 3 both in the Js-band and in the Ks-band LF. The decline of the number
density of bright galaxies seen at z>0.8 suggests that a significant fraction
of them increases their stellar mass at 1<z<2-3 and that they underwent a
strong evolution in this redshift range. On the other hand, this implies also
that a significant fraction of local bright/massive galaxies was already in

is spread over a large redshift range and that the increase of their stellar

probing the intergalactic medium (IGM) by GRBs at the epoch of the
reionization. Here we present a spectral modeling analysis of the optical
afterglow spectrum taken by the Subaru Telescope, aiming to constrain the
reionization history. The spectrum shows a clear damping wing at wavelengths
redward of the Lyman break, and the wing shape can be fit either by a damped Ly
alpha system with a column density of log (N_HI/cm^{-2}) ~ 21.6 at a redshift
close to the detected metal absorption lines (z_metal = 6.295), or by almost
neutral IGM extending to a slightly higher redshift of z_{IGM,u} ~ 6.36. In the
latter case, the difference from z_metal may be explained by acceleration of
metal absorbing shells by the activities of the GRB or its progenitor. However,
we exclude this possibility by using the light transmission feature around the
Ly beta resonance, leading to a firm upper limit of z_{IGM,u} < 6.314. We then
show an evidence that the IGM was largely ionized already at z=6.3, with the
best-fit neutral fraction of IGM, x_HI = N_HI/N_H = 0.00, and upper limits of
x_HI < 0.17 and 0.60 at 68 and 95% C.L., respectively. This is the first direct
and quantitative upper limit on x_HI at z > 6. Various systematic uncertainties
are examined, but none of them appears large enough to change this conclusion.
To get further information on the reionization, it is important to increase the
sample size of z >~ 6 GRBs, in order to find GRBs with low column densities
(log N_HI <~ 20) within their host galaxies, and for statistical studies of Ly
alpha line emission from host galaxies.

many physical problems in the Knudsen diffusion regime. In this paper, the
collisions of ballistic particles interacting with an irregular surface modeled
by a quadratic Koch curve, are studied numerically. The $q$ moments of the
source spatial distribution of collision numbers $\mu(x)$ are characterized by
a sequence of ``collision exponent'' $\tau(q)$. The measure $\mu(x)$ is found
to be multifractal even when a random micro-roughness (or random re-emission)
of the surface exists. The dimensions $f(\alpha)$, obtained by a Legendre
transformation from $\tau(q)$, consist of two parabolas corresponding to a
trinomial multifractal. This is demonstrated for a particular case by obtaining
an exact $f(\alpha)$ for a multiplicative trinomial mass distribution. The
trinomial nature of the multifractality is related to the type of surface
macro-irregularity considered here and is independent of the micro-roughness of
the surface which however influence the values of $\alpha_{min}$ and
$\alpha_{max}$. The information dimension $D_I$ increases significantly with
the micro-roughness of the surface. Interestingly, in contrast with this point
of view, the surface seems to work uniformly. This correspond to an absence of
screening effects in Knudsen diffusion.

aggregate. In case (ii) ground state inclusions prefer to aggregate. When the
inclusion density is not coupled to the local membrane curvature, in case (i)
the typical length scale ($\sqrt{M}$) of the inclusion clusters shows weak
dependence on the excitation rate ($K_{on}$) of the inclusions for a wide range
of $K_{on}$ but increases fast when $K_{on}$ becomes sufficiently large; in
case (ii) $\sqrt{M}\sim {K_{on}}^{-{1/3}}$ for a wide range of $K_{on}$. When
the inclusion density is coupled to the local membrane curvature, the curvature
coupling provides the upper limit of the inclusion clusters. In case (i) (case
(ii)), the formation of the inclusions is suppressed when $K_{off}$ ($K_{on}$)

not have sufficient time to aggregate. We also find that the mobility of an

temperatures. Superconductivity is lacking in pristine graphite, but after

seen to be robust. The method is then applied to a scale-free inherent

static, we can examine the growth of the network as a function of a threshold
energy (rather than time), where only those transition states with energies
lower than the threshold energy contribute to the network.For these networks we
are able to detect the presence of preferential attachment, and this helps to
explain the ubiquity of funnels on energy landscapes. However, the scale-free

motion in the surrounding aqueous solution until they rebind to a filament. We
use variants of driven lattice gas models to describe the interplay of their
active movements, the unbound diffusion, and the binding/unbinding dynamics. If
the motor concentration is large, motor-motor interactions become important and
lead to a variety of cooperative traffic phenomena such as traffic jams on the
filaments, boundary-induced phase transitions, and spontaneous symmetry
breaking in systems with two species of motors. If the filament is surrounded
by a large reservoir of motors, the jam length, i.e., the extension of the
traffic jams is of the order of the walking distance. Much longer jams can be
found in confined geometries such as tube-like compartments.

tensor T_uv, one class of frequency metrics that satisfies both Einstein's
general relativistic equation and the perfect fluid condition is: g_uv = e^iwt
N_uv. Mathematically, such metrics indicate spacetime behaves locally like a
simple harmonic oscillator. In the cosmological model presented here these
small spacetime oscillations compress vacuum energy into a standing wave inside
a dynamic Casimir cavity. At peak compression a phase shift occurs and the
standing wave forms into a particle having relativistic mass-energy equal to
the compressive work required to produce it. At this point the newly formed
particle does isobaric work to expand the volume against the external pressure
given T_ii. Equilibrium is achieved when the collision rate on the volume's
internal and external surfaces equalizes. By treating spacetime as a classical
thermodynamic problem and oscillator, such quantities as the mass of the
compressed particle--that of an axion, the radii of the initial and final
volume of compression, and the angular frequency of compression can be
determined. During axion collision the photon frequency of the particle is
calculated to be in the microwave range and inversely equal to that of the
frequency of the spacetime compression that produced the particle. This

observationally indistinguishable in the special theory of relativity, a
duality that carries over into the general theory under Fermi coordinates along
a curve (in coordinate-independent language, in the tangent Minkowski space
along the curve). For example, on a clock stationary at radius $r$, a distant
observer sees time dilation of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2M/r}}$
under the Schwarzschild metric and sees the clock receding with a relative
velocity of $v=\sqrt{2M/r}$ under the Painlev{\'e}-Gullstrand free fall metric.
Duality implies that during gravitational collapse, the intensifying time
dilation observed at the star's center from a fixed radius $r>0$ is
indistinguishable (along a curve) from an increasing relative velocity at which
the center recedes as seen from any direction, implying a local inflation.

an accurate computation of the perturbations produced by the small body with

this GUT scenario, the upper bound on the total proton decay lifetime is tau_p

produced by the decay of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NSP).
Particularly, in the case where Q-balls cannot survive the evaporation, the
gravitino number density is given by the NSP's thermal relic density.
Interestingly, if Q-balls survive, they can be a source of gravitinos via the

with massive gluons can well be set up on the gauge-invariance principle. The
quantization of the chromodynamics was perfectly performed in the both of
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian path-integral formalisms by using the Lagrangian
undetermined multiplier method. In this paper, It is shown that the quantum
theory is invariant with respect to a kind of BRST-transformations. From the
BRST-invariance of the theory, the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by the
generating functionals of full Green functions, connected Green functions and
proper vertex functions are successively derived. As an application of the
above Ward-Takahashi identities, the Ward-Takahashi identities obeyed by the
massive gluon and ghost particle propagators and various proper vertices are
derived and based on these identities, the propagators and vertices are
perfectly renormalized. Especially, as a result of the renormalization, the
Slavnov-Taylor identity satisfied by renormalization constants is natually
deduced. To demonstrate the renormalizability of the theory, the one-loop
renormalization of the theory is carried out by means of the mass-dependent
momentum space subtraction scheme and the renormalization group approach,
giving an exact one-loop effective coupling constant and one-loop effective
gluon and quark masses which show the asymptotically free behaviors as the same
as those given in the quantum chromodynamics with massless gluons.

alternative to standard inflation to account for the origin of inhomogeneities

scalar perturbations through the bounce. In this work, we determine the
evolution of perturbations and the final spectrum for an arbitrary (spatially
flat) bouncing cosmology, with the only assumption that the bounce is governed
by a single physical scale. In particular, we find that the spectrum of the
pre-bounce growing mode of the Bardeen potential (which is scale-invariant in
some limit, and thus compatible with observations) survives unaltered in the
post-bounce only if the comoving pressure perturbation is directly proportional
to the Bardeen potential rather than its Laplacian, as for any known form of
ordinary matter. If some new physics acting at the bounce justifies such
relation, then bouncing cosmologies are entitled to become a real viable
alternative for the generation of the observed inhomogeneities. Our treatment
also includes some class of models with extra-dimensions, whereas we show that
bounces induced by positive spatial curvature are structurally different from
all bounces in spatially flat universes, requiring a distinct analysis.

  Supervisors : Dr. S. Vandoren, Prof. I. Moerdijk",,,,"math.QA math.CT",,"  This thesis provides an introduction to the various category theory ideas
employed in topological quantum field theory. These theories are viewed as
symmetric monoidal functors from topological cobordism categories into the
category of vector spaces. In two dimensions, they are classified by Frobenius
algebras. In three dimensions, and under certain conditions, they are
classified by modular categories. These are special kinds of categories in
which topological notions such as braidings and twists play a prominent role.
There is a powerful graphical calculus available for working in such
categories, which may be regarded as a generalization of the Feynman diagrams
method familiar in physics. This method is introduced and the necessary
algebraic structure is graphically motivated step by step.
  A large subclass of two-dimensional topological field theories can be
obtained from a lattice gauge theory construction using triangulations. In
these theories, the gauge group is finite. This construction is reviewed, from
both the original algebraic perspective as well as using the graphical calculus
developed in the earlier chapters.
  This finite gauge group toy model can be defined in all dimensions, and has a
claim to being the simplest non-trivial quantum field theory. We take the
opportunity to show explicitly the calculation of the modular category arising
from this model in three dimensions, and compare this algebraic data with the
corresponding data in two dimensions, computed both geometrically and from
triangulations. We use this as an example to introduce the idea of a quantum
field theory as producing a tower of algebraic structures, each dimension
related to the previous by the process of categorification.

which the topology on a space is treated, not as an infinitary lattice, but as
an exponential object of the same category as the original space, with an
associated lambda-calculus. In this paper, this is shown to be equivalent to a
notion of computable basis for locally compact sober spaces or locales,
involving a family of open subspaces and accompanying family of compact ones.
This generalises Smyth's effectively given domains and Jung's strong proximity
lattices. Part of the data for a basis is the inclusion relation of compact
subspaces within open ones, which is formulated in locale theory as the
way-below relation on a continuous lattice. The finitary properties of this
relation are characterised here, including the Wilker condition for the cover
of a compact space by two open ones. The real line is used as a running
example, being closely related to Scott's domain of intervals. ASD does not use
the category of sets, but the full subcategory of overt discrete objects plays
this role; it is an arithmetic universe (pretopos with lists). In particular,
we use this subcategory to translate computable bases for classical spaces into
objects in the ASD calculus.

  clarifications from previous version",,,,"math.NT",,"  A famous theorem of Szemer\'edi asserts that all subsets of the integers with
positive upper density will contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
There are many different proofs of this deep theorem, but they are all based on
a fundamental dichotomy between structure and randomness, which in turn leads
(roughly speaking) to a decomposition of any object into a structured
(low-complexity) component and a random (discorrelated) component. Important
examples of these types of decompositions include the Furstenberg structure
theorem and the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma. One recent application of this
dichotomy is the result of Green and Tao establishing that the prime numbers
contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions (despite having density zero
in the integers). The power of this dichotomy is evidenced by the fact that the
Green-Tao theorem requires surprisingly little technology from analytic number
theory, relying instead almost exclusively on manifestations of this dichotomy
such as Szemer\'edi's theorem. In this paper we survey various manifestations
of this dichotomy in combinatorics, harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and
number theory. As we hope to emphasize here, the underlying themes in these
arguments are remarkably similar even though the contexts are radically
different.

dynamics is considered following Davydov's approach for molecular excitons. In
the continuum limit the problem is reduced to dynamical equations with
fractional derivatives resulting from the fractional power of the long-range
interaction. Fractional generalizations of the sine-Gordon, nonlinear
Schrodinger, and Hilbert-Schrodinger equations have been found. There exists a

moving common clock remains unchanged, that is, the hand of the clock never
runs slow, but the time interval between its two consecutive ticks contracts,
so the relative time has to be recorded by using the tau-clocks required by the
transformations, instead of unreal slowing clocks. Thus it is argued that using
rest common clocks or the equivalent the measured velocity of light emitted by
a moving source, which is quasi-velocity of foreign light, is dependent of the
source velocity. Nevertheless, the velocity of foreign light that should be
measured by using tau-clocks is independent of the source velocity. The
velocity of native light emitted by a rest source obeys the postulate of
relativity in accordance with both Maxwell equations and the result of
Michelson-Morley experiment. On the other hand, the velocity of foreign light
obeys both Ritz's emission theory except the Lorentz factor and the postulate
of constancy of light velocity if measured by using tau-clocks. Thus the
emission theory does not conflict with special relativity. The present argument
leads to a logical consequence that the so-called positive conclusions from
experiments testing constancy of the velocity of light emitted by moving
sources if using common clocks or the equivalent, instead of tau-clocks,
exactly contradicts Lorentz transformations.

of solution of the exterior Dirichlet problem employs a classical boundary
integral formulation. Our version of the numerical method is especially
advantageous for following the dynamics of a very long and thin bubble, for
which an asymptotic scaling theory has been recently developed. Because of the
very large aspect ratio of the bubble, a direct implementation of the boundary
integral algorithm would be impractical. We modify the algorithm by introducing
a new approximation of the integrals which appear in the Fredholm integral
equation and in the integral expression for the normal derivative of the
pressure at the bubble interface. The new approximation allows one to
considerably reduce the number of nodes at the almost flat part of the bubble
interface, while keeping a good accuracy. An additional benefit from the new
approximation is in that it eliminates numerical divergence of the integral for
the tangential derivative of the harmonic conjugate. The interface's position
is advanced in time by using explicit node tracking, whereas the larger node

the variance in offspring number, natural selection will favor the genotype
with lower variance. The concept of fitness becomes cloudy under these
conditions because the outcome of evolution is not deterministic. However, the
effect of variance in offspring number on the fixation probability of mutant
strategies has been calculated under several scenarios with the general
conclusion that variance in offspring number reduces fitness but only in
proportion to the inverse of the population size (Gillespie 1974, Proulx 2000).
This relationship becomes more complicated under a metapopulation scenario
where the ""effective"" population size depends on migration rate, population
structure, and life cycle. We show that under hard selection and weak migration
fitness in a metapopulation composed of equal sized demes is determined by deme
size. Conversely, for high migration rates and hard selection the effective
fitness depends on the total size of the metapopulation. Interestingly, under
soft selection there is no effect of migration or neighboring population
structure on effective fitness, and fitness depends only on deme size. We use
individual based simulations in developed in Shpak (2005) to validate our
analytical approximations and investigate deviations of our assumption of equal

estimation algorithms.

  Gratings",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose the dynamic control of two-color stationary light in a
double-lambda four-level system using electromagnetically induced transparency.
We demonstrate the complete localization of two-color quantum fields inside a
medium using coherence moving gratings resulting from slow-light based
atom-field interactions in backward nondegenerate four-wave mixing processes.
The quantum coherent control of the two-color stationary light opens a door to
deterministic quantum information science which needs a quantum nondemolition
measurement, where the two-color stationary light scheme would greatly enhance
nonlinearity with increased interaction time.

an emphasis on the regimes specific to atom chips. Recent developments in
theory and experiment are highlighted. In particular, atom-surface interactions
define physical limits for miniaturization and coherent operation. This implies
constraints for applications in quantum information processing or matter wave
interferometry. We focus on atom-surface interaction potentials induced by
vacuum fluctuations (Van der Waals and Casimir-Polder forces), and on
transitions between atomic quantum states that are induced by thermally excited
magnetic near fields. Open questions and current challenges are sketched.

affects the performance of various experiments operating at the quantum noise

compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and observe a 10-fold
noise reduction in the frequency range up to 200 MHz. Based on our measurement
results as well as on numerical simulations we establish a model for the
reduction of GAWBS noise in photonic crystal fibers.

A 74, 022106 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.74.022106",,"quant-ph",,"  Non-Abelian quantum holonomies, i.e., unitary state changes solely induced by
geometric properties of a quantum system, have been much under focus in the
physics community as generalizations of the Abelian Berry phase. Apart from
being a general phenomenon displayed in various subfields of quantum physics,
the use of holonomies has lately been suggested as a robust technique to obtain
quantum gates; the building blocks of quantum computers. Non-Abelian holonomies
are usually associated with cyclic changes of quantum systems, but here we
consider a generalization to noncyclic evolutions. We argue that this open-path
holonomy can be used to construct quantum gates. We also show that a structure
of partially defined holonomies emerges from the open-path holonomy. This
structure has no counterpart in the Abelian setting. We illustrate the general
ideas using an example that may be accessible to tests in various physical
systems.
