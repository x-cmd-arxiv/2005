that enable us to explore the high order statistics efficiently in large data
sets. Central to this technique is to make decomposition both of fields and
operators within the framework of multi-resolution analysis (MRA), and realize
theirs discrete representations. Accordingly, a homogenous point process could
be equivalently described by a operation of a Toeplitz matrix on a vector,
which is accomplished by making use of fast Fourier transformation. The
algorithm could be applied widely in the cosmic statistics to tackle large data
sets. Especially, we demonstrate this novel technique using the spherical,
cubic and cylinder counts in cells respectively. The numerical test shows that
the algorithm produces an excellent agreement with the expected results.
Moreover, the algorithm introduces naturally a sharp-filter, which is capable
of suppressing shot noise in weak signals. In the numerical procedures, the
algorithm is somewhat similar to particle-mesh (PM) methods in N-body
simulations. As scaled with $O(N\log N)$, it is significantly faster than the
current particle-based methods, and its computational cost does not relies on
shape or size of sampling cells. In addition, based on this technique, we
propose further a simple fast scheme to compute the second statistics for
cosmic density fields and justify it using simulation samples. Hopefully, the
technique developed here allows us to make a comprehensive study of
non-Guassianity of the cosmic fields in high precision cosmology. A specific
implementation of the algorithm is publicly available upon request to the

telescope accuracy revealing in detail solar, supernova, atmospheric as well as

flare particles (protons, alpha) while scattering among themselves or hitting
the solar atmosphere must produce on sun prompt charged pions, whose decay (as
well as their sequent muon decays) into secondaries is source of a copious
solar neutrino ""flare"" (at tens or hundreds MeV energy). These brief (minutes)
neutrino ""burst"" at largest flare peak may overcome by three to five order of
magnitude the steady atmospheric neutrino noise on the Earth, possibly leading
to their emergence and detection above the thresholds. The largest prompt
""burst"" solar neutrino flare may be detected in future FLARE neutrino detectors
both in electron and positron and possibly in its muon pair neutrino component.
Our estimate for the recent and exceptional October - November 2003 solar
flares and last January 20th 2005 exceptional flare might lead to a few events
for future FLARE or near unity for present Super-KamiokandeII. The neutrino
spectra may reflect the neutrino flavor oscillations and mixing in flight. In
neutrino detectors a surprising (correlated) muon appearance may occur while a
rarer tau appearance may even marginally take place. A comparison of the solar
neutrino flare signal with other neutrino foreground is estimated: it offer the
first opportunity for an independent road map to disentangle the neutrino
flavor puzzles, as well a prompt alarm system for dangerous solar flare
eruptions.

Multi-dimensional transport aspects are treated by the ``ray-by-ray plus''
approximation described in Paper I. Our set of models includes a 2D calculation
for a 15 solar mass star whose iron core is assumed to rotate rigidly with an
angular frequency of 0.5 rad/s before collapse. No important differences were
found depending on whether random seed perturbations for triggering convection
are included already during core collapse, or whether they are imposed on a 1D
collapse model shortly after bounce. Convection below the neutrinosphere sets
in about 40 ms p.b. at a density above 10**12 g/cm^3 in all 2D models, and
encompasses a layer of growing mass as time goes on. It leads to a more
extended proto-neutron star structure with accelerated lepton number and energy
loss and significantly higher muon and tau neutrino luminosities, but reduced
mean energies of the radiated neutrinos, at times later than ~100 ms p.b. In
case of an 11.2 solar mass star we find that low (l = 1,2) convective modes
cause a probably rather weak explosion by the convectively supported
neutrino-heating mechanism after ~150 ms p.b. when the 2D simulation is
performed with a full 180 degree grid, whereas the same simulation with 90
degree wedge fails to explode like all other models. This sensitivity
demonstrates the proximity of our 2D models to the borderline between success
and failure, and stresses the need of simulations in 3D, ultimately without the
axis singularity of a polar grid. (abridged)

of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies observed with
integral-field spectrographs. The generalisation follows the approach of
surface photometry by determining the best fitting ellipses along which the
profiles of the moments can be extracted and analysed by means of harmonic
expansion. The assumption for the odd moments (e.g. mean velocity) is that the
profile along an ellipse satisfies a simple cosine law. The assumption for the
even moments (e.g velocity dispersion) is that the profile is constant, as it
is used in surface photometry. We find that velocity profiles extracted along
ellipses of early-type galaxies are well represented by the simple cosine law
(with 2% accuracy), while possible deviations are carried in the fifth harmonic
term which is sensitive to the existence of multiple kinematic components, and
has some analogy to the shape parameter of photometry. We compare the
properties of the kinematic and photometric ellipses and find that they are
often very similar. Finally, we offer a characterisation of the main velocity
structures based only on the kinemetric parameters which can be used to
quantify the features in velocity maps (abridged).

extracted in 0.4"" steps along the slit reveal striking variations in continuum
slope, silicate feature profile and depth, and fine structure line fluxes on
subarcsecond scales, illustrating in unprecedented detail the complexity of the
circumnuclear regions of this galaxy at mid-IR wavelengths. A comparison of
photometry in various apertures reveals two distinct components: a compact
(radius <15 pc), bright source within the central 0.4"" x 0.4"" and extended,
lower brightness emission. We identify the compact source with the AGN
obscuring torus, and the diffuse component with the AGN-heated dust in the
ionization cones. While the torus emission dominates the flux observed in the
near-IR, the mid-IR flux measured with apertures larger than about 1"" is
dominated instead by the dust emission from the ionization cones. Many previous
attempts to determine the torus spectral energy distribution are thus likely to
be significantly affected by contamination from the extended emission. The

(SZE) observable-mass relations using high-resolution cosmological simulations.
The simulations of eleven individual clusters spanning a decade in mass are
performed with the shock-capturing Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement
N-body+gasdynamics ART code. To assess the impact of galaxy formation, we
compare two sets of simulations performed in an adiabatic regime and those with
several physical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation:
radiative cooling, star formation, stellar feedback and metal enrichment. We
show that a SZE signal integrated to a sufficiently large fraction of cluster
volume correlates strongly with its enclosed mass, independent of details of
gas physics and dynamical state of the cluster. The slope and redshift
evolution of the SZE flux-mass relation are also insensitive to processes of
galaxy formation and are well characterized by a simple self-similar cluster
model. Its normalization, on the other hand, is significantly affected by gas
cooling and associated star formation. Our simulations show that inclusion of
these processes suppresses the normalization by ~30-40%. The effect is due to a
decrease in gas mass fraction, which is offset slightly by an increase in gas
mass-weighted temperature. Gas cooling and star formation also cause an
increase in total mass and modify the normalization by a few percent. Finally,
the comparison with recent observations of the SZE scaling relations highlights
the importance of galaxy formation in theoretical modelling of clusters and
shows that current generation of simulations produce clusters with gross
properties quite similar to their observed counterparts.

gamma-ray background (CGB). Since dark matter particles are weakly interacting,
annihilation can happen only in high density regions such as dark matter halos.
The precise shape of the energy spectrum of CGB depends on the nature of dark
matter particles, as well as the cosmological evolution of dark matter halos.
In order to discriminate between the signals from dark matter annihilation and
other astrophysical sources, however, the information from the energy spectrum
may not be sufficient. We show that dark matter annihilation also produces a
characteristic anisotropy of the CGB, which provides a powerful tool for
testing the origin. We develop the formalism based on a halo model approach to
calculate the three-dimensional power spectrum of dark matter clumping, which
determines the power spectrum of annihilation signals. We show that the
sensitivity of future gamma-ray detectors such as GLAST should allow us to
measure the angular power spectrum of CGB anisotropy, if dark matter particles
are supersymmetric neutralinos and they account for most of the observed mean
intensity of CGB in GeV region. On the other hand, if dark matter has a
relatively small mass, and accounts for most of the CGB in MeV region, then the
future Advanced Compton Telescope should be able to measure the anisotropy in
MeV region. As the intensity of photons from annihilation is proportional to
the density squared, we show that the predicted shape of the angular power
spectrum of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation is different from that due
to other astrophysical sources such as blazars. Therefore, the angular power
spectrum of the CGB provides a smoking-gun signature of dark matter
annihilation.

observe radial information through the frequency, and thus three-dimensional
regions of the background radiation at different redshifts, suggests that 21 cm
studies may provide a useful context for studying weak lensing effects. We
focus on the gravitational lensing effects on both the angular power spectra
and the intrinsic, three-dimensional power spectra. We present a new approach
for calculating the weak lensing signature based on integrating differential
Fourier-space shells of the deflection field and approximating the
magnification matrix. This method is applied to reionization models of the 21
cm spectra up to small angular scales over a range in redshift. The effect on
the angular power spectrum is typically < 1% on small angular scales, and very
small on scales corresponding to the feature imprinted by reionization bubbles,
due to the near-scale invariance of the angular power spectrum of the 21 cm
signal on these scales. We describe the expected effect of weak lensing on
three-dimensional 21 cm power spectra, and show that lensing creates aspherical
perturbations to the intrinsic power spectrum which depend on the polar angle
of the wavevector. The effect on the 3D power spectrum is < 1% on scales k <
0.1 h/Mpc, but can be > 1% for highly inclined modes for k > 1 h/Mpc. The
angular variation of the lensing effect on these scales is well described by a
quartic polynomial in the cosine of the polar angle. The detection of the
gravitational lensing effects on 21 cm power spectra will require very
sensitive, high resolution observations by future low-frequency radio arrays.

scales, where a continuous elastic description breaks down. This is apparent
when one considers their vibrational and transport properties, or the way
forces propagate in these solids. Little is known about the microscopic cause
of their rigidity. Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly
of elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where
the pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a
continuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling
is observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the
density of vibrational modes. In the present work we derive theoretically these
results, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter
and silica, but also to colloidal glasses. In particular we show that: (i)
these systems present a large excess of vibrational modes at low frequency in
comparison with normal solids, called the ""boson peak"" in the glass literature.
The corresponding modes are very different from plane waves, and their
frequency is related to the system coordination; (ii) rigidity is a non-local
property of the packing geometry, characterized by a length scale which can be
large. For elastic particles this length diverges near the jamming transition;
(iii) for repulsive systems the shear modulus can be much smaller than the bulk
modulus. We compute the corresponding scaling laws near the jamming threshold.
Finally, we discuss the applications of these results to the glass transition,
the transport, and the geometry of the random close packing.

the Anderson impurity model (AIM) and similar systems with a single conducting
channel. The object of principal interest is the generating function for the
cumulants of charge current distribution. We derive an exact analytic formula
relating the FCS generating function to the self energy of the system in the
presence of the measuring field. We first check that our approach reproduces
correctly known results in simple limits, like the FCS of the resonant level
system (AIM without Coulomb interaction). We then proceed to study the FCS for
the AIM both perturbatively in the Coulomb interaction and in the Kondo regime
at the Toulouse point (we also study a related model of a spinless single-site
quantum dot coupled to two half-infinite metallic leads in the Luttinger liquid
phase at a special interaction strength). At zero temperature the FCS turns out
to be binomial for small voltages. For the generic case of arbitrary energy
scales the FCS is shown to be captured very well by generalisations of the
Levitov-Lesovik type formula. Surprisingly, the FCS for the AIM indicates a
presence of coherent electron pair tunnelling in addition to conventional
single-particle processes. By means of perturbative expansions around the
Toulouse point we succeeded in showing the universality of the binomial FCS at

that it can provide a reasonable description to phase transitions and
spontaneous symmetry breaking. The extension is founded on three hypotheses,
and can be regarded as a microscopic edition of the Landau phenomenological
theory of phase transitions. Within its framework, the state of a system is
determined by the evolution of order parameter with temperature according to
such a principle that the entropy of the system will reach its minimum in this
state. The evolution of order parameter can cause change in representation of
the system Hamiltonian, different phases will realize different
representations. Physically, it turns out that phase transition originates from
the automatic interference among matter waves as temperature is cooled down.
Typical quantum many-body systems are studied with this extended ensemble
theory. In particular, the theory predicts that the specific heat Cp of liquid
He II will vanish linearly as T tends to zero, which is anticipating
experimental verifications.

diffusion in solids. The formulation is made in a general
statistical-mechanical way. The method of the nonequilibrium statistical
operator (NSO) developed by D. N. Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation
dynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may
produce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state
due to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice).
The generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly
coupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation
processes. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and
diffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and
coherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and
diffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the
Gorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the
nuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown
that due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity
spins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and
consequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the
spin diffusion. The explicit expressions for the relaxation time in certain
physically relevant cases are given.

information is costly. In general, information with higher value is more
costly. Another fundamental result from the information theory is that the
amount of information one can receive is the amount of information generated
minus equivocation. The level of equivocation, which is the measure of
information asymmetry, is determined by the correlation between the source of
information and the receiver of information. In general, how much information
one can receive depends on the background knowledge of the receiver. The
difference in cost different investors are willing to pay for information and
the difference in background knowledge about a particular information causes
the heterogeneity in information processing by the investment public, which is
the main reason of the price and volume patterns observed in the market. Many

naturally from this theory.

different excitation modes of the system. Near each of these limits, one can
use perturbation theory to achieve an accurate description of the eigenstates.
Away from the exact limits, however, one has to carry out a matrix
diagonalization because the basis-state mixing that occurs is typically too
large to be reproduced in any other way. An alternative to casting the problem
in terms of one or the other basis set consists of using an ""oblique"" basis
that uses both sets. Through a study of this alternative in this
one-dimensional problem, we are able to illustrate practical solutions and
infer the applicability of the concept for more complex systems, such as in the
study of complex nuclei where oblique-basis calculations have been successful.

techniques, has reached a high degree of perfection under these compactness
assumptions. In this paper we formulate an appropriate Guillemin-Sternberg
conjecture in the general case, under the main assumptions that the Lie group
action is proper and cocompact. This formulation is motivated by our
interpretation of the ""quantisation commuates with reduction"" phenomenon as a
special case of the functoriality of quantisation, and uses equivariant
K-homology and the K-theory of the group C*-algebra C*(G) in a crucial way. For
example, the equivariant index - which in the compact case takes values in the
representation ring R(G) - is replaced by the analytic assembly map - which
takes values in K_0(C*(G)) - familiar from the Baum-Connes conjecture in
noncommutative geometry. Under the usual freeness assumption on the action, we
prove our conjecture for all Lie groups G having a cocompact discrete normal
subgroup, but we believe it is valid for all unimodular Lie groups.

orientation of mechanical systems. Current attitude estimation algorithms use
coordinate representations for the group of rigid body orientations. All
coordinate representations of the group of orientations have associated
problems. While minimal coordinate representations exhibit kinematic
singularities for large rotations, non-minimal coordinates like quaternions
require satisfaction of extra constraints. A deterministic attitude estimation
problem for a rigid body with bounded measurement errors is considered here. An
attitude estimation algorithm that globally minimizes the attitide estimation
error, is obtained. Assuming that the initial attitude, the initial angular
velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an
uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude and the angular velocity of the
rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point
estimates, and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid measures the accuracy of
the estimates. The point estimates, and the uncertainty ellipsoids are
propagated using a Lie group variational integrator, and its linearization,
respectively. The attitude estimation is optimal in the sense that the attitude
estimation error and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized.

of a set of players in a game must satisfy an ""equilibrium concept"". All other
joint strategies are considered impossible; the only issue is what equilibrium
concept is ""correct"". This hypothesis violates the desiderata underlying
probability theory. Indeed, probability theory renders moot the problem of what
equilibrium concept is correct - every joint strategy can arise with non-zero
probability. Rather than a first-principles derivation of an equilibrium
concept, game theory requires a first-principles derivation of a distribution
over joint (mixed) strategies. This paper shows how information theory can
provide such a distribution over joint strategies. If a scientist external to
the game wants to distill such a distribution to a point prediction, that
prediction should be set by decision theory, using their (!) loss function. So
the predicted joint strategy - the ""equilibrium concept"" - varies with the
external scientist's loss function. It is shown here that in many games, having
a probability distribution with support restricted to Nash equilibria - as
stipulated by conventional game theory - is impossible. It is also show how to:
i) Derive an information-theoretic quantification of a player's degree of
rationality; ii) Derive bounded rationality as a cost of computation; iii)
Elaborate the close formal relationship between game theory and statistical
physics; iv) Use this relationship to extend game theory to allow

a strong influence on the isospin properties of the hot fragments. The

change with the number of peripheral clusters to get the value of R_m close to

relevant for diverse density- and current-dependent functionals and, in fact,
represents the self-consistent separable random-phase approximation (RPA),
hence the name SRPA. SRPA allows to avoid diagonalization of high-rank RPA
matrices and thus dwarfs the calculation expense. Besides, SRPA expressions
have a transparent analytical form and so the method is very convenient for the
analysis and treatment of the obtained results. SRPA demonstrates high
numerical accuracy. It is very general and can be applied to diverse systems.
Two very different cases, the Kohn-Sham functional for atomic clusters and
Skyrme functional for atomic nuclei, are considered in detail as particular
examples. SRPA treats both time-even and time-odd dynamical variables and, in
this connection, we discuss the origin and properties of time-odd currents and
densities in initial functionals. Finally, SRPA is compared with other
self-consistent approaches for the excited states, including the
coupled-cluster method.

based on a new conception of geometry. In the framework of this conception any
geometry is obtained as a result of the proper Euclidean geometry deformation.
In the framework of this conception it is possible such a space-time geometry,
where the free particle motion appears to be stochastic, although the geometry
in itself remains to be deterministic. The stochasticity intensity depends on
the particle mass. It is small for particle of a large mass, and it is
essential for the particle of a small mass. The space-time geometry may be
chosen in such a way, that the statistical description of random world lines of
particles be equivalent to the quantum description (the Schr\""{o}dinger

be obtained as a corollaries of the statistical description of nonrelativistic
stochastic particles. The nonrelativistic quantum principles may not be used

assessment of cardiovascular system. We developed a novel pulse wave detection
system using low frequency specific piezoelectric material as pressure wave
sensor. The transducer detects the periodic change in the arterial wall
diameter produced by pressure wave and the amplified signal after integration
represents the pressure wave. The signal before integration is proportional to
the rate of change of pressure wave and it not only reproduces the pressure
waveform faithfully, but also its sharper nature helps to reliably detect the
heart period variability (HPV). We have studied the position-specific (e.g.
over carotid or radial artery) nature of change of this pulse wave signal
(shape and amplitude) and also the changes at different physiological states.

are derived, with special emphasis on noise analysis, showing the dominant
noise sources to originate from fluctuation processes in the junction. At
optimum conditions the circuit is found to deliver excellent noise performance
over a broad dynamic range. Our simple models apply within the regime of
classical Josephson junction and circuit dynamics, which we confirm by
experimental results. A discussion on possible applications includes a
measurement of the response to a cryogenic radiation detector.

investigated with a simple spin like stochastic model. The effects of
transcriptional fluctuations in protein synthesis is probed by coupling
transcription and translation by an amplificative interaction. In the presence
of repression a new term contributes to the noise which depends on the rate of
mRNA production. If the switching time is small compared with the mRNA life
time the noise is also small. In general the dumping of protein production by a
repressive agent occurs linearly but the fluctuations can show a maxima at
intermediate repression. The discrepancy between the switching time, the mRNA
degradation and protein degradation is crucial for the repressive control in
translation without large fluctuations. The noise profiles obtained here are in
quantitative agreement with recent experiments.

coupled to a mesoscopic spin bath and weakly coupled to other environmental

quantum dynamics of solid-state quantum bits such as electron spins in
semiconductor structures and superconducting islands. The role of mesoscopic
degrees of freedom with long correlation times (local degrees of freedom such
as nuclear spins and charge traps) in qubit-related dephasing is discussed in
terms of a quasi-static bath. A mathemat- ical framework simultaneously
describing coupling to the slow mesoscopic bath and a Markovian environment is
developed and the dephasing and decoherence properties of the total system are
investigated. The model is applied to several specific examples with direct
relevance to current ex- periments. Comparisons to experiments suggests that
such quasi-static degrees of freedom play an important role in current qubit
implementations. Several methods of mitigating the bath-induced error are
considered.

gives rise to periodic potentials acting as gratings for cold atoms. In strong
magnetic field gradients the lattice constant can be well below 1 micrometer.
By changing the frequencies of the comb in time the gratings can easily be
propagated in space, which may prove useful for Bragg scattering atomic matter
waves. Furthermore, almost arbitrarily shaped potential are possible such as
disordered potentials on a scale of several 100 nm or lattices with a spatially
varying lattice constant. The potentials can be made state selective and, in
the case of atomic mixtures, also species selective. This opens new
perspectives for generating tailored quantum systems based on ultra cold single
atoms or degenerate atomic and molecular quantum gases.
