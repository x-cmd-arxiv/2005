with the orientation defined by only one of the bipolar outflows identified in

outflow formation has not been coeval. IRAS 07027-7934 shows a bright,
marginally extended emission (FWHM=0.3"") in the mid-infrared with a slightly
elongated shape along the N-S direction, consistent with the morphology
detected by HST in the near-infrared. The mid-infrared emission is interpreted
as the result of the combined contribution of small, highly ionized PAHs and
relatively hot dust continuum. We propose that IRAS 07027-7934 may have
recently experienced a thermal pulse (likely at the end of the AGB) which has
produced a radical change in the chemistry of its central star.

neutrino-driven baryonic wind which sets in about 200 ms after bounce. The

about or slightly more than 10**50 erg, and leave behind neutron stars (NSs)

such explosions, the ejecta during the first second have a proton-to-baryon

ejected. This excludes such explosions as sites of a low-entropy r-process. The
low explosion energy and nucleosynthetic implications are compatible with the

depend on galaxy peculiar velocities, and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation
measurable by weak lensing. We then change one or more cosmological parameters
and use chi^2-minimization to find the galaxy HOD that best reproduces the
original clustering. Our parameterization of the HOD incorporates a flexible
relation between galaxy occupation numbers and halo mass and allows spatial and
velocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos. Despite this flexibility,
we find that changes to the HOD cannot mask substantial changes to the matter
density Omega_m, the matter clustering amplitude sigma_8, or the shape
parameter Gamma of the linear matter power spectrum -- cosmology and bias are
not degenerate. With the conservative assumption of 10% fractional errors, the

sigma_8, Omega_m, and Gamma, using galaxy clustering data ALONE. The
combination sigma_8*Omega_m^0.75 is constrained to ~5%. In combination with
traditional methods that focus on large scale structure in the ""perturbative""
regime, HOD modeling can greatly amplify the cosmological power of galaxy
redshift surveys by taking advantage of high-precision clustering measurements
at small and intermediate scales (from sub-Mpc to ~20Mpc/h). At the same time,
the inferred constraints on the galaxy HOD provide valuable tests of galaxy
formation theory.

data from the HIPPARCOS mission (abscissa residuals) to establish the elements
of the outer orbit (P = 15.8 yr) and accurate values for the masses and radii
(1-2% errors) and the effective temperatures of the binary components. Both
stars are rotating rapidly and have their rotation synchronized with the
orbital motion. There are signs of activity including strong X-ray emission and
possibly spots. Current stellar evolution models agree well with the properties
of the primary, but show a very large discrepancy in the radius of the
secondary: the predicted values are about 10% smaller than observed (a 5-sigma
effect). Also, the temperature is cooler than predicted by some 200 K. These
discrepancies are quite remarkable given that the star is only 7% less massive
than the Sun, the calibration point of all stellar models. We identify the
chromospheric activity as the likely cause of the effect. Inactive stars agree
very well with the models, while active ones such as V1061 Cyg Ab appear
systematically too large and too cool. Theory provides an understanding of this
in terms of the strong magnetic fields commonly associated with stellar
activity, which tend to inhibit convective heat transport.

tightly correlated with the stellar mass and velocity dispersion of the bulge.
In a hierarchical universe, mergers of subgalactic units are accompanied by the
amalgamation of bulges and the likely coalescence of galactocentric black
holes. In these mergers, the beaming of gravitational radiation during the
plunge phase of the black hole collision can impart a linear momentum kick or
``gravitational recoil'' to the remnant. If large enough, this kick will eject
the remnant from the galaxy and populate intergalactic space with wandering
black holes. Using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, we investigate
the effect of black hole ejections on the scatter in the relation between black
hole and bulge mass. We find that although not the dominant source of the
measured scatter, they do make a significant contribution and may be used to
set a constraint, v_kick<500 km/s, on the typical kick velocity, in agreement
with values found from general relativistic calculations. Even for the more
modest kick velocities implied by these calculations, we find that a
substantial number of central black holes are ejected from the progenitors of
present day galaxies, giving rise to a population of wandering intrahalo and
intergalactic black holes whose distribution we investigate in high-resolution
N-body simulations of Milk-Way mass halos. We find that intergalactic black
holes make up only ~2-3% of the total galactic black hole mass but, within a
halo, wandering black holes can contribute up to about half of the total black
hole mass orbiting the central galaxy. Intrahalo black holes offer a natural
explanation for the compact X-ray sources often seen near the centres of
galaxies and for the hyperluminous non-central X-ray source in M82.

asteroid binaries in four respects (Veillet2002): their frequency is an order
of magnitude larger, the mass ratio of their components is closer to unity, and
their orbits are wider and highly eccentric. Two explanations have been
proposed for their formation, one assuming large numbers of massive bodies
(Weidenschilling2002), and one assuming large numbers of light bodies
(Goldreich2002). We argue that both assumptions are unwarranted, and we show
how TNO binaries can be produced from a modest number of intermediate-mass
bodies of the type predicted by the gravitational instability theory for the
formation of planetesimals (Goldreich and Ward1973). We start with a TNO binary
population similar to the asteroid binary population, but subsequently modified
by three-body exchange reactions, a process that is far more efficient in the
Kuiper belt, because of the much smaller tidal perturbations by the Sun. Our
mechanism can naturally account for all four characteristics that distinguish

(defined geometrically for Q generic) on the square lattice. The solution is
based on a detailed analysis of the Bethe ansatz equations (which involve
staggered source terms) and on extensive numerical diagonalization of transfer
matrices. It involves subtle distinctions between the loop/cluster version of
the model, and the associated RSOS and (twisted) vertex models. The latter's
continuum limit involves two bosons, one which is compact and twisted, and the
other which is not, with a total central charge c=2-6/t, for
sqrt(Q)=2cos(pi/t). The non-compact boson contributes a continuum component to
the spectrum of critical exponents. For Q generic, these properties are shared
by the Potts model. For Q a Beraha number [Q = 4 cos^2(pi/n) with n integer]
the two-boson theory is truncated and becomes essentially Z\_{n-2}
parafermions. Moreover, the vertex model, and, for Q generic, the Potts model,
exhibit a first-order critical point on the transition line, i.e., the critical
point is also the locus of level crossings where the derivatives of the free
energy are discontinuous. In that sense, the thermal exponent of the Potts
model is generically nu=1/2. Things are profoundly different for Q a Beraha
number, where the transition is second order, with nu=(t-2)/2 determined by the
psi\_1 parafermion. As one enters the adjacant Berker-Kadanoff phase, the model
flows, for t odd, to a minimal model of CFT with c=1-6/t(t-1), while for t even
it becomes massive. This provides a physical realization of a flow conjectured
by Fateev and Zamolodchikov in the context of Z\_N integrable perturbations.
Finally, we argue that the antiferromagnetic transition occurs as well on other
two-dimensional lattices.

revived interest in the role of electron-lattice coupling. The recently studied
conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron-lattice coupling,
involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon), that was predicted by
standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment. Here we present
inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the
Cu-O bond-stretching phonon in the cuprate superconductors La2-xSrxCuO4 (with

La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and
magnetic order, often called stripe order. It occurs at a wave vector
corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant
electron-phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped

electron-phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of

indirect.

resource allocation algorithms in fading multiple access channels. The users
are assumed to be selfish, rational, and limited by average power constraints.
We show that the sum-rate optimal point on the boundary of the multipleaccess
channel capacity region is the unique Nash Equilibrium of the corresponding
water-filling game. This result sheds a new light on the opportunistic
communication principle and argues for the fairness of the sum-rate optimal
point, at least from a game theoretic perspective. The base-station is then
introduced as a player interested in maximizing a weighted sum of the
individual rates. We propose a Stackelberg formulation in which the
base-station is the designated game leader. In this set-up, the base-station
announces first its strategy defined as the decoding order of the different
users, in the successive cancellation receiver, as a function of the channel
state. In the second stage, the users compete conditioned on this particular
decoding strategy. We show that this formulation allows for achieving all the
corner points of the capacity region, in addition to the sum-rate optimal
point. On the negative side, we prove the non-existence of a base-station
strategy in this formulation that achieves the rest of the boundary points. To
overcome this limitation, we present a repeated game approach which achieves
the capacity region of the fading multiple access channel. Finally, we extend
our study to vector channels highlighting interesting differences between this
scenario and the scalar channel case.

  (JSAC) special issue on advances in multi-carrier CDMA",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A game-theoretic model for studying power control in multi-carrier CDMA
systems is proposed. Power control is modeled as a non-cooperative game in
which each user decides how much power to transmit over each carrier to
maximize its own utility. The utility function considered here measures the
number of reliable bits transmitted over all the carriers per Joule of energy
consumed and is particularly suitable for networks where energy efficiency is
important. The multi-dimensional nature of users' strategies and the
non-quasiconcavity of the utility function make the multi-carrier problem much
more challenging than the single-carrier or throughput-based-utility case. It
is shown that, for all linear receivers including the matched filter, the
decorrelator, and the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector, a user's
utility is maximized when the user transmits only on its ""best"" carrier. This
is the carrier that requires the least amount of power to achieve a particular
target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the
receiver. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the proposed
power control game are studied. In particular, conditions are given that must
be satisfied by the channel gains for a Nash equilibrium to exist, and the
distribution of the users among the carriers at equilibrium is also
characterized. In addition, an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching
the equilibrium (when it exists) is presented. It is shown that the proposed
approach results in significant improvements in the total utility achieved at
equilibrium compared to a single-carrier system and also to a multi-carrier
system in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier
independently.

with different and finite masses, in a simple confining and chiral invariant
quark-antiquark interaction, leading to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking
and to constituent quarks. In the false chiral invariant vacuum, the chiral
partners are degenerate, and tachyons occur in the light-light spectrum. In the
true vacuum, most of the standard non-relativistic quark model spectra should
be recovered except for the pion and other particular constraints. The
calibration problem of chiral quark models is also addressed here. The detailed
inspection of the different contributions to the D and Ds masses suggests that
the challenging recently observed Ds*(2317) and Ds*(2460) mesons might not fit
as global chirally rotated quark-antiquark Ds mesons.

the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, in which all nine quarks pair in a
particularly symmetric fashion. Once the heaviness of the strange quark (mass
$m_s$) and the requirements of electric and color neutrality are taken into
account, the CFL pattern of color superconductivity requires the pairing of
quarks that would, in the absence of pairing, have Fermi momenta that differ by
of order $m_s^2/\mu$, with $\mu$ the quark number chemical potential. This
means that at sufficiently small $\mu$, the ``stress'' on the pairing is large
enough that the system can lower its energy by breaking pairs, resulting in
some unconventional color superconductor which includes gapless excitations,
spatial inhomogeneity, counter-propagating currents, or all three. In this
paper we ask whether there is some less symmetric but still conventional
pattern of pairing that can evade the stress. In other words, is there a
pattern of pairing in which, once electric and color neutrality are imposed by
suitable chemical potentials, pairing only occurs among those quarks whose
Fermi momenta would be equal in the absence of pairing? We use
graph-theoretical methods to classify 511 patterns of conventional color
superconducting pairing, and show that none of them meet this requirement. All
feel a stress, and all can be expected to become unstable to gapless modes at a
density comparable to that at which the CFL phase becomes unstable.

implies a primordial Li7 abundance factor of two to three larger than that
inferred by observations of low--metallicity halo stars. Recent observations of
Li6 in halo stars suggest a pre--galactic origin of this isotope, which is
exceedingly difficult to explain by putative high redshift cosmic ray
populations. We investigate if one or both of these lithium problems may be
solved by late decaying relic particles in the Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) coupled to gravity. Assuming that the
gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) we find that in large
parts of the CMSSM parameter space either of these problems can be potentially
solved. In particular, we also find solutions where both lithium problems may
be solved simultaneously. These entail the hadronic decay of relic 1 TeV staus
into 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 sec after the Big Bang, as proposed by one of
us before. Moreover, the produced gravitinos naturally contribute a large
fraction, or all, to the by WMAP required dark matter density. A prediction of
this model is the dark matter to be lukewarm with free--streaming lengths of
the order of a 4 keV early freezing--out relic particle. Such lukewarm
gravitino dark matter may have beneficial effects to the formation of galactic
structures and may be constrained by the reionisation history of the Universe.
The current version of the paper presents results for both cases (a) when
catalytic nuclear reations are included and (b) when they are neglected.

biology. Over the past 50 years quantitative experimental knowledge on this
biological model has been accumulated at all levels: physics, chemistry,
genomics, proteomics, functions, and more. All its components have been known
to a great detail. The theoretical task has been to integrate its components to
make the organism working quantitatively in a harmonic manner. This would test
our biological understanding and would lay a solid fundamental for further
explorations and applications, an obvious goal of systems biology. One of the
outstanding challenges in doing so has been the so-called stability puzzle of
lambda switch: the biologically observed robustness and its difficult
mathematical reconstruction based on known experimental values. In this chapter
we review the recent theoretical and experimental efforts on tackling this
problem. An emphasis is put on the minimum quantitative modeling where a
successful numerical agreement between experiments and modeling has been
achieved. A novel method tentatively named stochastic dynamical structure
analysis emerged from such study is also discussed within a broad modeling
perspective.

(PHMM). In order to process large genomes that have undergone complex genome
rearrangements, almost all existing whole genome alignment methods apply fast
heuristics to divide genomes into small pieces which are suitable for
Needleman--Wunsch alignment. In these alignment methods, it is standard
practice to fix the parameters and to produce a single alignment for subsequent
analysis by biologists.
  Our main result is the construction of a whole genome parametric alignment of
Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura. Parametric alignment
resolves the issue of robustness to changes in parameters by finding all
optimal alignments for all possible parameters in a PHMM. Our alignment draws
on existing heuristics for dividing whole genomes into small pieces for
alignment, and it relies on advances we have made in computing convex polytopes
that allow us to parametrically align non-coding regions using biologically
realistic models. We demonstrate the utility of our parametric alignment for
biological inference by showing that cis-regulatory elements are more conserved
between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura than previously
thought. We also show how whole genome parametric alignment can be used to
quantitatively assess the dependence of branch length estimates on alignment
parameters.

differentiate it from the model-based approach previously explored. A distinct
advantage of this perspective is that it allows evaluation of multiple tree
shape statistics describing different aspects of tree shape. After developing
the methodology, it is applied here to make specific recommendations for a
suite of three statistics which will hopefully prove useful in applications.

Such representations involve a specific labeling of the vertices or at least
the leaves, and so it is natural to attempt to identify trees by some feature
of the associated matrices that is invariant under relabeling. An obvious
candidate is the spectrum of eigenvalues (or, equivalently, the characteristic
polynomial). We show for any of these choices of matrix that the fraction of
binary trees with a unique spectrum goes to zero as the number of leaves goes
to infinity. We investigate the rate of convergence of the above fraction to
zero using numerical methods. For the adjacency and Laplacian matrices, we show
that that the {\em a priori} more informative immanantal polynomials have no
greater power to distinguish between trees.
