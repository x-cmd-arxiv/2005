clouds, with mass-to-flux ratio lambda = (2 pi sqrt{G}) (Sigma/B) ~ 1 (here
Sigma is the total column density and B is the field strength). It is widely
believed that ``subcritical'' clouds with lambda < 1 cannot collapse, based on
virial arguments by Mestel and Spitzer and a linear stability analysis by
Nakano and Nakamura. Here we confirm, using high resolution numerical models
that begin with a strongly supersonic velocity dispersion, that this criterion
is a fully nonlinear stability condition. All the high-resolution models with
lambda <= 0.95 form ``Spitzer sheets'' but collapse no further. All models with
lambda >= 1.02 collapse to the maximum numerically resolvable density. We also
investigate other factors determining the collapse time for supercritical
models. We show that there is a strong stochastic element in the collapse time:
models that differ only in details of their initial conditions can have
collapse times that vary by as much as a factor of 3. The collapse time cannot
be determined from just the velocity dispersion; it depends also on its
distribution. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our
results.

extrasolar planets shifts to planets with smaller masses and longer orbital
periods. The method of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides a rigorous
method for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital parameters in a Bayesian
framework (Ford 2005a). The main practical challenge for the general
application of MCMC is the need to construct Markov chains which quickly
converge. The rate of convergence is very sensitive to the choice of the
candidate transition probability distribution function (CTPDF). Here we explain
one simple method for generating alternative CTPDFs which can significantly
speed convergence by one to three orders of magnitude. We have numerically
tested dozens of CTPDFs with simulated radial velocity data sets to identify
those which perform well for different types of orbits and suggest a set of
CTPDFs for general application. Additionally, we introduce other refinements to
the MCMC algorithm for radial velocity planets, including an improved treatment
of the uncertainties in the radial velocity observations, an algorithm for
automatically choosing step sizes, an algorithm for automatically determining
reasonable stopping times, and the use of importance sampling for including the
dynamical evolution of multiple planet systems. Together, these improvements
make it practical to apply MCMC to multiple planet systems. We demonstrate the
improvements in efficiency by analyzing a variety of extrasolar planetary

However, such successes in Newtonian cosmology are not purely based on Newton's

theory. The action-at-a-distance nature of Newton's gravity requires further
verification from Einstein's theory for its use in the large-scale nonlinear
regimes. We study the domain of validity of the Newtonian cosmology by
investigating weakly nonlinear regimes in relativistic cosmology assuming a
zero-pressure and irrotational fluid. We show that, first, if we ignore the
coupling with gravitational waves the Newtonian cosmology is exactly valid even
to the second order in perturbation. Second, the pure relativistic correction
terms start appearing from the third order. Third, the correction terms are
independent of the horizon scale and are quite small in the large-scale near
the horizon. These conclusions are based on our special (and proper) choice of
variables and gauge conditions. In a complementary situation where the system
is weakly relativistic but fully nonlinear (thus, far inside the horizon) we
can employ the post-Newtonian approximation. We also show that in the
large-scale structures the post-Newtonian effects are quite small. As a
consequence, now we can rely on the Newtonian gravity in analyzing the
evolution of nonlinear large-scale structures even near the horizon volume.

contrary, the LSB galaxies follow a different relation, since most of them show
either higher Vc (or lower sigma) with respect to the HSB galaxies. This argues
against the relevance of baryon collapse in the radial density profile of the
dark matter haloes of LSB galaxies. Moreover, if the Vc-sigma relation is
equivalent to one between the mass of the dark matter halo and that of the
supermassive black hole, these results suggest that the LSB galaxies host a
supermassive black hole with a smaller mass compared to HSB galaxies of equal

approximate flow equations derived from well motivated approximations. These
approximations exploit the derivative expansion and the decoupling of high
momentum modes. The method is applied to the O($N$) model. In leading order,
the self energy is already accurate both in the perturbative and the scaling
regimes. A stringent test is provided by the calculation of the shift $\Delta

result of Schwartz, any quasi-isometric image of a non-relatively hyperbolic

hyperbolic with nonrelatively hyperbolic peripheral subgroups is a
quasi-isometry invariant. As an application, Artin groups are relatively
hyperbolic if and only if freely decomposable.
  We also introduce a new quasi-isometry invariant of metric spaces called
metrically thick, which is sufficient for a metric space to be nonhyperbolic
relative to any nontrivial collection of subsets. Thick finitely generated
groups include: mapping class groups of most surfaces; outer automorphism
groups of most free groups; certain Artin groups; and others. Nonuniform
lattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups are thick and hence nonrelatively
hyperbolic, in contrast with rank one which provided the motivating examples of
relatively hyperbolic groups. Mapping class groups are the first examples of
nonrelatively hyperbolic groups having cut points in any asymptotic cone,
resolving several questions of Drutu and Sapir about the structure of
relatively hyperbolic groups. Outside of group theory, Teichmuller spaces for
surfaces of sufficiently large complexity are thick with respect to the

This study is motivated by their appearance in conformal field theory, where
these series are essentially the irreducible characters of $(2,2k+1)$ Virasoro
minimal models. We determine the vanishing of such Wronskians, a result whose
proof reveals many partition identities. For example, if $P_{b}(a;n)$ denotes
the number of partitions of $n$ into parts which are not congruent to $0, \pm
a\pmod b$, then for every positive integer $n$ we have $$ P_{27}(12;
n)=P_{27}(6;n-1) + P_{27}(3;n-2). $$ We also show that these quotients classify
supersingular elliptic curves in characteristic $p$. More precisely, if
$2k+1=p$, where $p\geq 5$ is prime, and the quotient is non-zero, then it is
essentially the locus of characteristic $p$ supersingular $j$-invariants in

majority of computations are performed in a definite scale and problems of
scalability are important both for physical theories and computational
algorithms. Taking a mapping of a topological space X with the discontinuity

define (Q,R)-continuity, weak (Q,R)-continuity, and R-continuity of this

intersection formulae.
  We describe a variant of this degeneration, due essentially to Samuel, Rees,
and Nagata, in which Y flatly degenerates to the ""balanced"" normal cone \barC_X
Y. This space is reduced, and has a natural map onto the reduction (C_X Y)_red
of C_X Y. The multiplicity of a component now appears as the degree of this
map. Hence intersection theory can be studied using only reduced schemes.
Moreover, since the map \barC_X Y \to (C_X Y)_red may wrap multiple components
of \barC_X Y around one component of C_X Y, writing the intersection product as
a sum over the components of \barC_X Y gives a further canonical refinement. \\
  In the case that X is a Cartier divisor in a projective scheme Y, we describe
the balanced normal cone in homotopy-theoretic terms, and prove a useful upper
bound on the Hilbert function of \barC_X Y.

magnetic moment, and charge quantization into one concrete description of the
