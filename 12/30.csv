to free streaming of the dark matter in a warm dark matter cosmological model
with a cosmological constant. The limits are derived in the framework of a
sterile neutrino warm dark matter universe, but can be applied to gravitinos
and other models with small scale suppression in the linear matter power
spectrum. With freedom in all cosmological parameters including the free
streaming scale of the sterile neutrino dark matter, limits are derived using
observations of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, the 3D
clustering of galaxies and 1D clustering of gas in the Lyman-alpha (Ly-alpha)
forest in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as the Ly-alpha forest
in high-resolution spectroscopic observations. In the most conservative case,
using only the SDSS main-galaxy 3D power-spectrum shape, the limit is m_s >
0.11 keV; including the SDSS Ly-alpha forest, this limit improves to m_s > 1.7
keV. More stringent constraints may be placed from the inferred matter power
spectrum from high-resolution Ly-alpha forest observations, which has
significant systematic uncertainties; in this case, the limit improves to m_s >
3.0 keV (all at 95% CL).

collisions during binary scattering encounters offer an alternate channel for
runaway growth, somewhat independent of direct collisions between single stars.
We find that clusters with binary fractions >~10% yield two VMSs via

probabilities of strong lensing by a single plane or by multiple planes. We
find that for theta ~ 10 arcsec, a single plane accounts for almost all (~ 98%)
of the strong lensing cases for source redshift unity. However, for a more
typical source redshift of 4, about 12% of the strong lensing cases will result
from the contribution of a secondary clump of matter along the line of sight,
introducing a systematic error in the determination of the surface density of

scaling with critical exponent products nu*z = 0.65-0.7. The parallel critical
magnetic field increased with electron transfer as (dn_c-dn)^0.33, where dn is
the electron transfer and dn_c is its critical value, and the critical
resistance decreased linearly with dn. However at lower temperatures, in the

extrapolation of its temperature dependence at higher temperatures, and scaling
failed. These observations imply that although the electrostatic- and parallel

boundary that can be crossed either by tuning electron density or magnetic

prerequisite for quantum computing, and in this paper we will discuss

Under steady flow conditions, these two ensembles give similar results for the
average shear stress versus shear velocity. However, near jamming it is
possible that the shear stress required to initiate shear flow can differ
substantially from the shear stress required to maintain flow. We perform
several measurements of the shear stress near the initiation and cessation of
flow. At fixed shear velocity, we measure the average shear stress
$\Sigma_{yv}$ in the limit of zero shear velocity. At fixed shear force, we
measure the minimum shear stress $\Sigma_{yf}$ required to maintain steady flow
at long times. We find that in finite-size systems $\Sigma_{yf} > \Sigma_{yv}$,
which implies that there is a jump discontinuity in the shear velocity from
zero to a finite value when these systems begin flowing at constant shear
force. However, our simulations show that the difference $\Sigma_{yf} -
\Sigma_{yv}$, and thus the discontinuity in the shear velocity, tend to zero in
the infinite system size limit. Thus, our results indicate that in the large
system limit, frictionless granular systems are characterized by a single
static yield shear stress. We also monitor the short-time response of these
systems to applied shear and show that the packing fraction of the system and
shape of the velocity profile can strongly influence whether or not the shear
stress at short times overshoots the long-time average value.

understand the escape of neon from small (N=5) endohedral Ne@C60 clusters.
Multiple runs at various temperatures are used to increase the reliability of
our statistics. The cluster holds together until somewhere between T = 1150K
and T = 1200K, where it dissociates, showing no intermediate sign of melting or
fullerene disintegration. When the temperature is increased to around T =
4000K, the encapsulated neon atoms begin to leave the cluster, with the
fullerene molecules still remaining intact. At temperatures near T = 4400K,
thermal disintegration of the fullerenes pre-empts the cluster dissociation.
The neon atoms are then more quickly released and the fullerenes form a larger
connected structure, with bonding taking place in atom pairs from different
original fullerene molecules. Escape constants and half lives are calculated
for the temperature range 4000K < T < 5000K. The agreements and disagreements
of results of this work with experiments suggest that classical MD simulations
are useful in describing fullerene systems at low temperatures and near
disintegration, but require more thought and modification before accurately
modeling windowing at temperatures below T = 3000K.

a self-consistent adiabatic local-density approximation in the presence of
spin-conserving and spin-dephasing impurity scattering. Based on a quantum
kinetic equation, we derive Gilbert damping and spin-transfer torques entering
the Landau-Lifshitz equation to linear order in frequency and wave vector.
Gilbert damping and a current-driven dissipative torque scale identically and
compete, with the result that a steady current-driven domain-wall motion is
insensitive to spin dephasing in the limit of weak ferromagnetism. A uniform
magnetization is found to be much more stable against spin torques in the
itinerant than in the \textit{s}-\textit{d} model for ferromagnetism. A dynamic
spin-transfer torque reminiscent of the spin pumping in multilayers is
identified and shown to govern the current-induced domain-wall distortion.

increasing grain diameter, a property verified for the first time for an MTC

stationary distribution is uniform, thus ensuring that generation occurs
uniformly at random. We also introduce a novel w-adjusting heuristic which,

models, it is possible that large Z(3) walls arise at the end of the reheating
stage. Collapse of such walls could lead to baryon inhomogeneities which may be
separated by large distances near the QCD scale. Importantly, the generation of
these inhomogeneities is insensitive to the order, or even the existence, of
the quark-hadron phase transition. We also briefly discuss the possibility of
formation of quark nuggets in this model, as well as baryon inhomogeneity
generation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Non-perturbative corrections due to color-octet effects are considered for the
first time and shown to vanish at leading order. Exact, all order expressions
for the relevant 1/m and 1/m^2 operators are derived. The results allow us to
scrutinize several potential model claims. In particular, we show that QCD
excludes both contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the quarkonium
induced by low-energy fluctuations and contributions to the magnetic dipole
operators of the type induced by a scalar potential. Finally, we apply our
results to the transitions J/psi -> eta_c gamma, Upsilon(1S) -> eta_b gamma,
Upsilon(2S) -> eta_b(2S) gamma, Upsilon(2S) -> eta_b gamma, eta_b(2S) ->

analysis shows that the J/psi -> eta_c gamma width is consistent with a
weak-coupling treatment of the charmonium ground state, while such a treatment
for the hindered transition Upsilon(2S) -> eta_b gamma appears difficult to
accommodate within the CLEO III upper limit.

MS-like renormalization schemes has been solved for the running coupling as a
series expansion in powers of the exact 2-loop order coupling. In this work, we
prove that the power series converges to all orders in perturbation theory.
Solving the RG equation at higher orders, we determine the running coupling as
an implicit function of the 2-loop order running coupling. Then we analyze the
singularity structure of the higher order coupling in the complex 2-loop
coupling plane. This enables us to calculate the radii of convergence of the
series solutions at the 3- and 4-loop orders as a function of the number of
quark flavours $n_{\rm f}$. In parallel, we discuss in some detail the
singularity structure of the ${\bar{\rm MS}}$ coupling at the 3- and 4-loops in
the complex momentum squared plane for $ 0\leq n_{\rm f} \leq 16 $. The
correspondence between the singularity structure of the running coupling in the
complex momentum squared plane and the convergence radius of the series
solution is established. For sufficiently large $n_{\rm f}$ values, we find
that the series converges for all values of the momentum squared variable
$Q^2=-q^2>0$. For lower values of $n_{\rm f}$, in the ${\bar{\rm MS}}$ scheme,
we determine the minimal value of the momentum squared $Q_{\rm min}^2$ above
which the series converges. We study properties of the non-power series
corresponding to the presented power series solution in the QCD Analytic
Perturbation Theory approach of Shirkov and Solovtsov. The Euclidean and
Minkowskian versions of the non-power series are found to be uniformly
convergent over whole ranges of the corresponding momentum squared variables.

polynomial having only few non-zero coefficients from few random samples.
Inspired by recent work of Candes, Romberg and Tao we propose to recover the
polynomial by Basis Pursuit, i.e., by $\ell^1$-minimization. Numerical
experiments show that in many cases the trigonometric polynomial can be
recovered exactly provided the number $N$ of samples is high enough compared to
the ``sparsity'' -- the number of non-vanishing coefficients. However, $N$ can
be chosen small compared to the assumed maximal degree of the trigonometric
polynomial. Hence, the proposed scheme may overcome the Nyquist rate. We
present two theorems that explain this observation. Unexpectly, they establish
a connection to an interesting combinatorial problem concerning set partitions,
which seemingly has not yet been considered before.

that encapsulate, and hence provide protection for, the viral genome. Despite
of its huge success and numerous applications in virology experimental results
have provided evidence for the fact that the theory is too restrictive to
describe all known viruses. Especially, the family of Papovaviridae, which
contains cancer-causing viruses, falls out of the scope of this theory.
  In a recent paper we have shown that certain members of the family of
Papovaviridae can be described via tilings. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive mathematical framework for the derivation of all surface
structures of viral particles in this family. We show that this formalism fixes
the structure and relative sizes of all particles collectively so that there
exists only one scaling factor that relates the sizes of all particles with
their biological counterparts.

optical cavity is examined. A five degree of freedom model of the fluctuations
of the longitudinal and transverse mirror coordinates is presented. Classical
and quantum mechanical effects of radiation pressure are studied with the help
of the optical stiffness coefficients and the signals provided by an FM
sideband technique and a quadrant detector, for generic values of the product
$\varpi \tau $ of the fluctuation frequency times the cavity round trip. A
simplified version is presented for the case of small misalignments. Mechanical
stability, mirror position entanglement and ponderomotive squeezing are
accommodated in this model. Numerical plots refer to cavities under test at the
so-called Pisa LF facility.

  entanglement with vacuum","This paper is basically a reply to quant-ph/0507189 by S. J. van Enk
  and to the remarks we got from L. Vaidman after our preliminary
  quant-ph/0507151. Version accepted in Phys. Rev. A","Phys. Rev. A 73, 042111 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.042111",,"quant-ph",,"  We analyze an example of a photon in superposition of different modes, and
ask what is the degree of their entanglement with vacuum. The problem turns out
to be ill-posed since we do not know which representation of the algebra of
canonical commutation relations (CCR) to choose for field quantization. Once we
make a choice, we can solve the question of entanglement unambiguously. So the
difficulty is not with mathematics, but with physics of the problem. In order
to make the discussion explicit we analyze from this perspective a popular
argument based on a photon leaving a beam splitter and interacting with two
two-level atoms. We first solve the problem algebraically in Heisenberg
picture, without any assumption about the form of representation of CCR. Then
we take the $\infty$-representation and show in two ways that in two-mode
states the modes are maximally entangled with vacuum, but single-mode states
are not entangled. Next we repeat the analysis in terms of the representation
of CCR taken from Berezin's book and show that two-mode states do not involve
the mode-vacuum entanglement. Finally, we switch to a family of reducible
representations of CCR recently investigated in the context of field
quantization, and show that the entanglement with vacuum is present even for
single-mode states. Still, the degree of entanglement is here difficult to
estimate, mainly because there are $N+2$ subsystems, with $N$ unspecified and
large.

entanglement measure. This measure can be applied to a much wider class of
multipartite mixed states, although still ""quasi"" in the sense that it is still
incapable of dividing precisely the sets of all separable and entangled states.
As a quadratic scalar function of the system density matrix, the quasi measure
can be easily expressed in terms of the so-called coherence vector of the
system density matrix, by which we show the basic properties of the quasi
measure including (1) zero-entanglement for all separable states, (2)
invariance under local unitary operations, and (3) non-increasing under local
POVM (positive operator-valued measure) measurements. These results open up
perspectives in further studies of dynamical problems in open systems,
especially the dynamic evolution of entanglement, and the entanglement
preservation against the environment-induced decoherence effects.

enables truncation of the Fock-state expansion of an input optical field to

device is proposed using an eight-port optical interferometer. Upon
post-selection based on photon counting results, the interferometer implements
generation and teleportation of qudit (d-dimensional) states by truncation of
an input field at the (d-1)th term of its Fock-state expansion up to d=6.
Examples of selective truncations, which can be interpreted as a Fock-state
filtering and hole burning in the Fock space of an input optical field, are
discussed. Deterioration of the truncation due to imperfect photon counting is
discussed including inefficiency, dark counts and realistic photon-number
resolutions of photodetectors.
