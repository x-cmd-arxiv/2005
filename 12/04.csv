telescope at CTIO, show a more extensive network of filaments than had been
known previously. Filaments emitting in [O III] are distributed throughout much
of the 8 arcmin diameter shell seen in X-ray and radio images, including a few
at the very outermost shell limits. We have also detected four small complexes
of filaments that show [S II] emission along with [OIII]. In a single long-slit
spectrum we find variations of almost an order of magnitude in the relative
strengths of oxygen and sulfur lines, which must result from abundance
variations. None of the filaments, with or without [S II], shows any evidence
for hydrogen, so all appear to be fragments of pure SN ejecta. The [S II]
filaments provide the first evidence for undiluted products of oxygen burning
in the ejecta from the supernova that gave rise to G292.0+1.8. Some oxygen
burning must have occurred, but the paucity of [S II]-emitting filaments
suggests that either the oxygen burning was not extensive or that most of its
products have yet to be excited. Most of the outer filaments exhibit radial,
pencil-like morphologies that suggest an origin as Rayleigh-Taylor fingers of
ejecta, perhaps formed during the explosion. Simulations of core-collapse
supernovae predict such fingers, but these have never before been so clearly
observed in a young SNR. The total flux from the SNR in [OIII] 5007 is 5.4 *
10**-12 ergs/cm**2/s. Using a distance of 6 kpc and an extinction correction
corresponding to E(B-V) = 0.6 (lower than previous values but more consistent
both with our data and radio and X-ray estimates of NH), this leads to a
luminosity of 1.6 * 10**35 ergs/s in the 5007 Ang. line.

  Inform. Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT",,"  The problem of joint universal source coding and identification is considered
in the setting of fixed-rate lossy coding of continuous-alphabet memoryless
sources. For a wide class of bounded distortion measures, it is shown that any
compactly parametrized family of $\R^d$-valued i.i.d. sources with absolutely
continuous distributions satisfying appropriate smoothness and
Vapnik--Chervonenkis learnability conditions, admits a joint scheme for
universal lossy block coding and parameter estimation, such that when the block
length $n$ tends to infinity, the overhead per-letter rate and the distortion
redundancies converge to zero as $O(n^{-1}\log n)$ and $O(\sqrt{n^{-1}\log
n})$, respectively. Moreover, the active source can be determined at the
decoder up to a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{n^{-1} \log n})$ in variational
distance, asymptotically almost surely. The system has finite memory length
equal to the block length, and can be thought of as blockwise application of a
time-invariant nonlinear filter with initial conditions determined from the
previous block. Comparisons are presented with several existing schemes for
universal vector quantization, which do not include parameter estimation
explicitly, and an extension to unbounded distortion measures is outlined.
Finally, finite mixture classes and exponential families are given as explicit
examples of parametric sources admitting joint universal compression and
modeling schemes of the kind studied here.

field is nonconfining while, as is well known, the monopole field potential is
linear. Furthermore, we show that the sum of these potentials approximates the
nonabelian static potential with 5% or higher precision at all distances
considered. We conclude that at large distances the monopole field potential
describes the classical energy of the hadronic string while the modified
nonabelian field potential describes the string fluctuations. Similar
decomposition was observed to work for the adjoint static potential. A check
was also made of the center projection in the direct center gauge. Two static
potentials, determined by projected $Z_2$ and by modified nonabelian field
without $Z_2$ component were calculated. It was found that their sum is a
substantially worse approximation of the SU(2) static potential than that found
in the monopole case. It is further demonstrated that similar decomposition can
be made for the flux tube action/energy density.

A, 74, 042308, 2006","10.1103/PhysRevA.74.042308",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the problem of designing unambiguous programmable discriminators
for any n unknown quantum states in an m-dimensional Hilbert space. The
discriminator is a fixed measurement that has two kinds of input registers: the
program registers and the data register. The quantum state in the data register
is what users want to identify, which is confirmed to be among the n states in
program registers. The task of the discriminator is to tell the users which
state stored in the program registers is equivalent to that in the data
register. First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for judging an
unambiguous programmable discriminator. Then, if $m=n$, we present an optimal
unambiguous programmable discriminator for them, in the sense of maximizing the
worst-case probability of success. Finally, we propose a universal unambiguous
programmable discriminator for arbitrary n quantum states.

computational framework for entanglement in interacting many-body quantum
systems. DFT can, in particular, shed light on the intriguing relationship
between quantum phase transitions and entanglement. We use DFT concepts to
express entanglement measures in terms of the first or second derivative of the
ground state energy. We illustrate the versatility of the DFT approach via a
variety of analytically solvable models. As a further application we discuss
entanglement and quantum phase transitions in the case of mean field
approximations for realistic models of many-body systems.

samples emitting in the near infrared region when optically excited.
Photoluminescence of these single emitters have several striking features, such
as a narrow-band fully polarized emission (FWHM 2 nm) around 780 nm, a short
excited-state lifetime of about 2 ns, and perfect photostability at room
temperature under our excitation conditions. We present a detailed study of
their photophysical properties. Development of a triggered single-photon source
relying on this single colour centre is discussed in the prospect of its
application to quantum key distribution.
