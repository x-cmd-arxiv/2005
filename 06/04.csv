cylindrical annulus. We show that at the rotation rates relevant to the
magneto-rotational instability, the flow is strongly constrained by the
Taylor-Proudman theorem. As a result, it is controlled almost entirely by the
end-plates. We then consider two possible options for minimizing these
end-effects, namely (i) simply taking a very long cylinder, and (ii) splitting
the end-plates into a series of differentially rotating rings. Regarding option
(i), we show that the cylinder would have to be hundreds of times as long as it
is wide before end-effects become unimportant in the interior. Since this is
clearly not feasible, we turn to option (ii), and show that in order to obtain
a smooth angular velocity profile, the end-plates would have to be split into
around ten rings. If the end-plates are split into fewer rings, perhaps 3-5,
the angular velocity profile will not be smooth, but will instead consist of a
series of Stewartson layers at the boundaries from one ring to the next. We
suggest therefore that the instabilities one obtains in this system will be the
familiar Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of these Stewartson layers, rather than
the magneto-rotational instability. At best, one might hope to obtain the MRI
superimposed on these Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. Any subsequent interpretation of
results is thus likely to be quite complicated.

MCG-6-30-15 based on a 522 ksec observation with Chandra's High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer. The Chandra spectrum is consistent with the
presence of a relativistically broadened, highly redshifted iron K alpha
emission line with a similar profile to previous observations. A number of
narrow features are detected above 2 keV, including a narrow Fe K alpha
emission line and narrow absorption lines from H- and He-like Fe, H-like S and
H-like Si. This absorption is well described by a photoionized plasma with a
column density log N_H = 23.2 and an ionization parameter log xi = 3.6,
assuming the iron abundance has the Solar value and a velocity dispersion
parameter b = 100 km/s. Applying this absorption model to a high fidelity
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectrum we find that a broad iron line is still required
with emission extending to within 1.9 gravitational radii of the black hole. If
the iron line comes from an accretion disk truncated at the innermost stable
circular orbit, this indicates that the black hole must be spinning rapidly
with a>0.95. Ionized absorption models attempting to explain the 3-6 keV
spectral curvature without strong gravity predict absorption lines in the
6.4-6.6 keV range that are inconsistent with the Chandra spectrum. The H- and
He-like iron absorption lines in the Chandra spectrum are blueshifted by 2.0
(+0.7/-0.9) x 10^3 km/s compared to the source frame, and may originate in a
high velocity, high ionization component of the warm absorber outflow. This
high ionization component may dominate the energy budget of the outflow, and
account for a significant fraction of the outflowing mass. (Abstract

redshift of 3.5, including LFs of galaxy types separated to red and blue
galaxies. The increase in the number density of luminous galaxies, at the
bright-end of the LF, can be explained as due to a brightening of the
luminosity of galaxies present in dark matter halo centers, relative to the
luminosity of central galaxies in similar mass halos today. The lack of strong
evolution in the faint-end of the LF, however, argues against a model involving
pure luminosity evolution at all halo mass scales. The increase in luminosity
at the bright-end compensates the rapid decline in the number density of
massive halos as the redshift is increased. The decline in group to
cluster-mass dark matter halos out to a redshift of ~ 2 is not important as the
central galaxy luminosity flattens at halo masses around 10^13 M_sun At
redshifts ~ 2 to 3, however, the density of bright galaxies begins to decrease
due to the rapid decline in the number density of dark matter halos at mass
scales around and below 10^13 M_sun. We compare our predictions to the UV LF of
galaxies at redshifts 3 to 6 and the galaxy clustering bias measurements at
redshifts ~ 3, and use our models to establish the dark matter halo mass scales

transition from a rapid Gaussian to a slow power law ($\sim 1/t^{3/2}$) when
the exchange interaction becomes nonzero and the singlet-triplet correlator
acquires a phase shift given by a universal (parameter independent) value of
$3\pi/4$ at long times. The oscillation frequency and time-dependent phase
shift of the singlet-triplet correlator can be used to perform a precision
measurement of the exchange interaction and Overhauser field fluctuations in an
experimentally accessible system. We also address the effect of orbital
dephasing on singlet-triplet decoherence, and find that there is an optimal
operating point where orbital dephasing becomes negligible.

$k\in\mathbb{Z}$, the SUSY Chern numbers. In the no-instanton sector (k=0), N=2
SUSY can be chirally realized, the 3 new N=2 generators anticommuting with the

has zero modes which form an N=1 supermultiplet and an atypical representation
of N=2 SUSY. They break the chiral SUSY generators by the Fujikawa mechanism.
We have not found this mechanism for SUSY breakdown in the literature. All
these phenomena occur also on the supersphere SUSY, the graded commutative
limit of the fuzzy model. We plan to discuss that as well in a later work.

of the saving propensity distribution on the corresponding wealth distribution
is studied. Various results about kinetic multi-agent models are collected and
used to construct a realistic wealth distribution with zero limit for small
values of wealth, an exponential form at intermediate and a power law tail at
larger values of wealth.

traditional black hole entropy. Variations of Sbh can be obtained which depend
on the occupancy of phase space cells. A relation is derived between the

wavelength relation.

pulses on nanoparticle coated targets is compared with that from optically
polished targets. The yield enhancement offered by nanoparticles is studied
under different prepulse conditions. It is observed that the enhancement
reduces when the nanoparticle coated target is irradiated with a prepulse with
intensity greater than 10^13 W/cm^2. When the prepulse intensity exceeds 10^14
W/cm^2, the enhancement vanishes completely. This is attributed to preplasma
formation on nanoparticles their subsequent structural modifcation before the
arrival of the main pulse. It is suggested that high-contrast ultrashort pulses
are essential for nanoparticles to function as yield enhancers.

  Mech",,"10.1017/S0022112006009888",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  We report experimental results for the influence of a tilt angle beta
relative to gravity on turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection of cylindrical
samples. The measurements were made at Rayleigh numbers R up to 10^11 with two
samples of height L equal to the diameter D (aspect ratio Gamma = D/L = 1). The
fluid was water with a Prandtl number sigma = 4.38. In contrast to the
experiences reported by Chilla et. al. (2004) for a similar sample but with
Gamma = 0.5 (D = 0.5 and L = 1.0 m), we found no long relaxation times. For R =
9.4 times 10^10 we measured the Nusselt number N as a function of tilt angle
beta and obtained a small beta dependence about a factor of 50 smaller than the
result found by Chilla et. al. (2004) for their Gamma = 0.5 sample. We measured
side-wall temperatures at eight equally spaced azimuthal locations on the
horizontal mid-plane of the sample and used their cross-correlation functions
to find the turn-over time of the large-scale circulation (LSC). The resulting
Reynolds numbers R_e^cc were found to increase with beta. An important
conclusion is that the increase of R_e^cc with beta of the LSC does not
significantly influence the heat transport. Over the range 10^9 < R < 10^11 the
enhancement of R_e^cc at constant beta due to the tilt could be described by a
power law of R with an exponent of -1/6, consistent with a simple model that
balances the additional buoyancy due to the tilt angle by the shear stress
across the boundary layers. Even a small tilt angle dramatically suppressed the
azimuthal meandering and the sudden reorientations characteristic of the LSC in
a sample with beta = 0. The azimuthal mean of the temperature at the horizontal
mid-plane within our resolution was independent of beta.

  Rev. A",,,,"physics.chem-ph",,"  A generalization of the Kohn--Sham approach is derived where the
correlation-energy functional depends on the one-particle density matrix of
noninteracting states and on the external potential from the interacting
target-state. The one-particle equations contain the exact exchange potential,
a nonlocal correlation potential, and an additional operator involving the
correlation density. The electronic-energy functional has multiple solutions:
Any one-particle density matrix delivering the target-state density yields a
solution. In order to obtain the Kohn--Sham solution, the nonlocal operators
are converted into local ones using an approach developed by Sala and Gorling.
Since the exact exchange-potential is used, and the N--representability problem
does not arise--in contrast to the Kohn--Sham approach--errors from Coulomb
self-interactions do not occur, nor the need to introduce functionals defined
by a constraint search. Furthermore, the approach does not use the
Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. A density functional formalism is also derived that
assumes that the one-particle density matrices of interest have v-representable
(non-interacting) densities and that these density matrices can be written as
an explicit functional of the electron density. For simplicity, we only
consider noninteracting closed-shell states and target states that are
nondegenerate, singlet ground-states.

  foundations 3"". To be published by American Institute of Physics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The debate on the nature of quantum probabilities in relation to Quantum Non
Locality has elevated Quantum Mechanics to the level of an ""Operational
Epistemic Theory"". In such context the quantum superposition principle has an
extraneous non epistemic nature. This leads us to seek purely operational
foundations for Quantum Mechanics, from which to derive the current
mathematical axiomatization based on Hilbert spaces.
  In the present work I present a set of axioms of purely operational nature,
based on a general definition of ""the experiment"", the operational/epistemic
archetype of information retrieval from reality. As we will see, this starting
point logically entails a series of notions [state, conditional state, local
state, pure state, faithful state, instrument, propensity (i.e. ""effect""),
dynamical and informational equivalence, dynamical and informational
compatibility, predictability, discriminability, programmability, locality,
a-causality, rank of the state, maximally chaotic state, maximally entangled
state, informationally complete propensity, etc. ], along with a set of rules
(addition, convex combination, partial orderings, ...), which, far from being
of quantum origin as often considered, instead constitute the universal
""syntactic manual"" of the operational/epistemic approach. The missing
ingredient is, of course, the quantum superposition axiom for probability
amplitudes: for this I propose some substitute candidates of purely
operational/epistemic nature.
