state and variable power in the Comptonized component in the soft and very high
states. The lack of clear reflection features in the rms spectra implies that
the reflection and the X-ray continuum, when integrated over Fourier
frequencies, are correlated and vary with similar fractional amplitudes. Our
models predict two important features of rms spectra, not possible to be
clearly seen by the PCA due sensitivity limits. At soft X-rays, >~3 keV, we
predict the presence of a break in the rms spectrum at energy directly related
to the seed photon temperature. At higher energies, ~20--30 keV, we predict a
peak in the rms spectrum originating from the variability of the spectrum
produced by a hybrid thermal/non-thermal electron distribution. If these
features are confirmed by broad-band observations, they will impose important
constraints on the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization and the
electron distribution in the hot plasma.

spectrum is decomposed into a dominant scale-invariant Gaussian adiabatic

the noise model for a particular CMB experiment. However, in general these

from the same sample and with good statistical accuracy the evolution of the
LFs by galaxy type in several rest frame bands from a purely magnitude selected
sample. The magnitude limit of the VVDS allows the determination of the faint
end slope of the LF with unprecedented accuracy. Galaxies have been classified
in four spectral classes, using their colours and redshift, and LFs have been
derived in the U, B, V, R and I rest frame bands from z=0.05 to z=1.5. We find
a significant steepening of the LF going from early to late types. The M*
parameter is significantly fainter for late type galaxies and this difference
increases in the redder bands. Within each of the galaxy spectral types we find
a brightening of M* with increasing redshift, ranging from =< 0.5 mag for early
type galaxies to ~1 mag for the latest type galaxies, while the slope of the LF
of each spectral type is consistent with being constant with redshift. The LF
of early type galaxies is consistent with passive evolution up to z~1.1, while
the number of bright early type galaxies has decreased by ~40% from z~0.3 to
z~1.1. We also find a strong evolution in the normalization of the LF of latest
type galaxies, with an increase of more than a factor 2 from z~0.3 to z~1.3:
the density of bright late type galaxies in the same redshift range increases
of a factor ~6.6. These results indicate a strong type-dependent evolution and
identifies the latest spectral types as responsible for most of the evolution
of the UV-optical luminosity function out to z=1.5.

the thermal nature of this diffuse component. We measure a cluster temperature

the information contained in the ISW effect. We then use Fisher analysis to
forecast the expected uncertainties in the measured parameters from future ISW

black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible
optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both
the instantaneous and peak luminosity of the quasar, and we determine this
dependence using a large set of simulations of galaxy mergers varying host
galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to
deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions (LFs) and obtain the evolution
of the formation rate of quasars with a certain peak luminosity, n(L_peak,z).
Quasars spend extended periods of time at luminosities well below peak, and so
n(L_peak) has a maximum corresponding to the 'break' in the observed LF,
falling off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. From n(L_peak) and our
simulation results, we obtain self-consistent fits to hard and soft X-ray and
optical quasar LFs and predict many observables, including: column density
distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the LF of broad-line quasars in

that the outburst of V838 Mon and its evolution are different from that of a
classical nova or other classes of well-known eruptive variables. V838 Mon,
along with two other objects that have analogous properties, appears to
comprise a new class of eruptive variables. There are limited infrared studies
of V838 Mon. Here, we present near-infrared H band (1.5 - 1.75micron) spectra
of V838 Mon from late 2002 to the end of 2004. The principal, new result from
our work is the detection of several, rotation-vibration lines of water in the
H band spectra. The observed water lines have been modeled to first establish
that they are indeed due to water. Subsequently the temperature and column
densities of the absorbing material, from where the water absorption features
originate, are derived. From our analysis, we find that the water features
arise from a cool ~750-900 K region around V838 Mon which appears to be
gradually cooling with time.

bound to the globular cluster (GC) and have velocity significantly higher than
the dispersion velocity. For this reason we term them ''supra-thermal'' stars.
We also notice that, after the interaction, a considerable fraction (55-70%) of

the derived extinction curves and allows realistic estimations of the
uncertainties. An additional benefit of the technique is that it simultaneously
determines the fundamental properties of the reddened stars themselves, making
the procedure valuable for both stellar and interstellar studies. We
demonstrate how the extinction-without-standards curves make it possible to: 1)
study the uniformity of extinction in localized spatial regions with
unprecedented precision; 2) determine the relationships between different
aspects of curve morphology; 3) produce high quality extinction curves from low
color excess sightlines; and 4) derive reliable extinction curves for mid-late

extinction in open clusters and associations dominated by such stars. The
application of this technique to the available database of UV-through-IR SEDs,

by the discrete nature of the dot levels (phonon bottleneck). In order to
clarify the issue theoretically we consider a system of $N$ discrete fermionic

same energy (dispersionless phonons). In analogy to the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization procedure, we perform a unitary transformation into new

numerically exact treatment is possible. The formalism is applied to a GaAs
quantum dot with only two electronic levels. If close to resonance with the
phonon energy, the electronic transition shows a splitting due to quantum
mechanical level repulsion. This is driven mainly by one bosonic mode, whereas
the other two provide further polaronic renormalizations. The numerically exact
results for the electron spectral function compare favourably with an analytic
solution based on degenerate perturbation theory in the basis of shifted
oscillator states. In contrast, the widely used selfconsistent first-order Born

$\sigma(T)$, inducing a transition at $T=T_c$, so that $\sigma(T<T_c)=0$. The
critical behavior of $\sigma(T)$ above $T_c$ is $\ln\sigma(T)\propto -
(T-T_c)^{-1/2}$. The mechanism of transport in the critical regime is
many-particle transitions between distant states in Fock space.

vibrating piston in micro-gravity have measured distribution p(I) of impacts I
with a fix target. They give p(I) scaling as exp(-I/Io). This distribution
leads to a probability distribution function of speed v along z varying
approximately as f(v) scaling as (1/v) exp(-v/vo); hence it diverges as 1/v at
small speed and it is quite non Boltzmannian at large speed. Here, a model is
proposed, which explains these experimental impact distributions; it takes
account of the true role of the boundaries and of the dissipation in the gas.
This validates the experimental data. Different approximations are discussed.
Roles of boundaries and of 0-g condition are investigated theoretically. It is
argued that the piston plays the role of an impact generator or a ""velostat""
for the Knudsen gas. These results cast a doubt on the efficiency of the notion
of Boltzmann temperature and on the necessity to refer to Boltzman distribution
in such dilute systems. The model shows also that the medium has to be
considered as a whole, in global equilibrium: each part of the system is
exchanging with the whole (at least in the direction of vibration); this is
quite different from classic approach of dissipative systems based on local
exchange and equilibrium, which leads to a ""diffusive"" Boltzmann equation; here
the distribution f(z,t) is mainly propagative, i.e. f(z,v,t+dt)=f(z-vdt,v,t)
instead of diffusive.

solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$

hence deterministic and noiseless transmission channels open up. We investigate
the behavior of $F$ as diffractive impurities are added inside the cavity. We
find that $F$ recovers its universal value provided (i) impurities cover the
full cavity so that only a set of zero measure of classical trajectories may
avoid them, and (ii) the impurity scattering rate exceeds the inverse dwell

heterostructures, based on a unified semiclassical description of ballistic and
diffusive transport in semiconductors, is outlined. The aim is to provide a
framework for studying the interplay of spin relaxation and transport mechanism
in spintronic devices. Transport inside the (nondegenerate) semiconductor is
described in terms of a thermoballistic current, in which electrons move
ballistically in the electric field arising from internal and external
electrostatic potentials, and are thermalized at randomly distributed
equilibration points. Spin relaxation is allowed to take place during the
ballistic motion. For arbitrary potential profile and arbitrary values of the
momentum and spin relaxation lengths, an integral equation for a spin transport
function determining the spin polarization in the semiconductor is derived. For
field-driven transport in a homogeneous semiconductor, the integral equation
can be converted into a second-order differential equation that generalizes the
spin drift-diffusion equation. The spin-polarization in ferromagnet
semiconductor structures is obtained by matching the spin-resolved chemical
potentials at the interfaces, with allowance for spin-selective interface
resistances. Illustrative examples are considered.

is applied at each iteration. The proposed algorithm can be geometrically

and determine the dependence of physical quantities, such as the vacuum
expectation value v_W and mass m_h of the Higgs boson, on the fundamental
parameters of the Lagrangian--masses, couplings of new states, the fundamental
scale f of the sigma model, and the coefficients of operators quadratically
sensitive to the cutoff of the theory. On the one hand, we show that it is
possible to have the electroweak ground state and a relatively large cutoff
\Lambda = 4\pi f with f in the 2 TeV range without requiring unnaturally small
coefficients for quadratically divergent quantities, and with only moderate
cancellations between the contribution of different sectors to the effective
potential of the Higgs. On the other hand, this cannot be achieved while at the
same time keeping m_h close to its (bantamweight) current lower bound of 114.4
GeV. The natural expectation for m_h is O(f), mainly because of large
logarithmically divergent contributions to the effective potential of the
top-quark sector. Even a fine-tuning at the level of O(10^{-2}) in the
coefficients of the quadratic divergences is not enough to produce small
physical Higgs masses, and the natural expectation is in the 800 GeV range
(cruiserweight) for f \sim 2 TeV. We conclude that the littlest Higgs model is
a solution of the little hierarchy problem, in the sense that it stabilizes the
electroweak symmetry breaking scale to be a factor of 100 less than the cutoff
of the theory, but this requires a quite large physical mass for the Higgs, and
hence precision electroweak studies should be redone accordingly. We also study
finite temperature corrections.

condition (ANEC) using standard calculations for perfectly reflecting plates,
because the null geodesic would have to pass through the plates, where the
calculation breaks down. To avoid this problem, we compute the contribution to
ANEC for a geodesic that passes through a hole in a single plate. We consider
both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in two and three space
dimensions. We use a Babinet's principle argument to reduce the problem to a
complementary finite disk correction to the perfect mirror result, which we
then compute using scattering theory in elliptical and spheroidal coordinates.
In the Dirichlet case, we find that the positive correction due to the hole
overwhelms the negative contribution of the infinite plate. In the Neumann
case, where the infinite plate gives a positive contribution, the hole
contribution is smaller in magnitude, so again ANEC is obeyed. These results
can be extended to the case of two plates in the limits of large and small hole
radii. This system thus provides another example of a situation where ANEC
turns out to be obeyed when one might expect it to be violated.

adiabatic scalar perturbations in a regular bouncing universe (in four
dimensions). The method under scrutiny consists of splitting the Bardeen
potential into two pieces with independent evolutions, in order to avoid a
singular behavior at the boundaries of the region where the null energy
condition (NEC) is violated. However, we argue that this method violates
energy-momentum conservation. We then introduce a novel method which provides
two independent solutions for the Bardeen potential around the boundaries, even
in the case of adiabatic perturbations. The two solutions are well behaved and
not divergent.

distance. The latest, also called Carnot-Caratheodory or subriemannian
distance, is by definition the length of the shortest horizontal path between
points, that is to say the shortest path whose tangent vector is everywhere
horizontal with respect to the gauge connection. In noncommutative geometry all
the metric information is encoded within the Dirac operator D. In the classical
case, i.e. commutative, Connes's distance formula allows to extract from D the
geodesic distance on a riemannian spin manifold. In the case of a gauge theory
with a gauge field A, the geometry of the associated U(n)-vector bundle is
described by the covariant Dirac operator D+A. What is the distance encoded
within this operator ? It was expected that the noncommutative geometry
distance d defined by a covariant Dirac operator was intimately linked to the
Carnot-Caratheodory distance dh defined by A. In this paper we precise this
link, showing that the equality of d and dh strongly depends on the holonomy of
the connection. Quite interestingly we exhibit an elementary example, based on
a 2 torus, in which the noncommutative distance has a very simple expression
and simultaneously avoids the main drawbacks of the riemannian metric (no
discontinuity of the derivative of the distance function at the cut-locus) and
of the subriemannian one (memory of the structure of the fiber).

the non-resonance condition this result fails: there exist non-Schlesinger
isomonodromic deformations. In the present article we introduce the class of
the so-called isoprincipal deformations of Fuchsian systems. Every isoprincipal
deformation is also an isomonodromic one. In general, the class of the
isomonodromic deformations is much richer than the class of the isoprincipal
deformations, but in the non-resonant case these classes coincide. We prove
that a deformation is isoprincipal if and only if the residue matrices satisfy
the Schlesinger system. This theorem holds in the general case, without any
assumptions on the spectra of the residue matrices of the deformation. An
explicit example illustrating isomonodromic deformations, which are neither

all equality cases are equivalent to radially decreasing functions under

cooperative merging is proposed to increase throughput and increase distance

senses not only the preceding vehicle in the same lane but also the vehicle
immediately in front in the opposite lane. Prior to reaching the merge region,
the ACC vehicle adjusts its velocity to ensure that a safe gap for merging is
obtained. If on-ramp demand is moderate, partial implementation of cooperative

comprise neuronal microtubules. We use molecular dynamics and other
computational tools to explore the time-dependent behavior of conformational
states of a C-terminus of tubulin within a microtubule and assume that each
C-terminus interacts via screened Coulomb forces with the surface of a tubulin
dimer, with neighboring C-termini and also with any adjacent
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Each C-terminus can either bind to the
tubulin surface via one of several positively charged regions or can be allowed
to explore the space available in the solution surrounding the dimer. We find
that the preferential orientation of each C-terminus is away from the tubulin
surface but binding to the surface may also take place, albeit at a lower
probability. The results of our model suggest that perturbations generated by
the C-termini interactions with counter-ions surrounding a MAP2 may propagate
over distances greater than those between adjacent microtubules. Thus, the MAP2
structure is able to act as a kind of biological wire (or a cable) transmitting
local electrostatic perturbations resulting in ionic concentration gradients
from one microtubule to another. We briefly discuss implications the current
dynamic modeling may have on synaptic activation and potentiation.

many different basepairing patterns. For perfectly periodic sequences, early
bulk experiments of Poerschke indicate the existence of a sliding process,
permitting the rapid transition between different relative strand positions
[Biophys. Chem. 2 (1974) 83]. Here, we use a detailed theoretical model to
study the basepairing dynamics of periodic and nearly periodic DNA. As
suggested by Poerschke, DNA sliding is mediated by basepairing defects (bulge
loops), which can diffuse along the DNA. Moreover, a shear force f on opposite
ends of the two strands yields a characteristic dynamic response: An outward
average sliding velocity v~1/N is induced in a double strand of length N,
provided f is larger than a threshold f_c. Conversely, if the strands are
initially misaligned, they realign even against an external force less than
f_c. These dynamics effectively result in a viscoelastic behavior of DNA under
shear forces, with properties that are programmable through the choice of the
DNA sequence. We find that a small number of mutations in periodic sequences
does not prevent DNA sliding, but introduces a time delay in the dynamic
response. We clarify the mechanism for the time delay and describe it
quantitatively within a phenomenological model. Based on our findings, we
suggest new dynamical roles for DNA in artificial nanoscale devices. The
basepairing dynamics described here is also relevant for the extension of
repetitive sequences inside genomic DNA.

arbitrary pure and mixed states is derived. It expresses fidelity as an
interference sum of dephasing trajectories weighed by the Wigner function of
the initial state, and does not require that the initial state be localized in
position or momentum. This general dephasing representation is special in that,
counterintuitively, all of fidelity decay is due to dephasing and none due to
the decay of classical overlaps. Surprising accuracy of the approximation is
justified by invoking the shadowing theorem: twice--both for physical
perturbations and for numerical errors. It is shown how the general expression
reduces to the special forms for position and momentum states and for wave
packets localized in position or momentum. The superiority of the general over
the specialized forms is explained and supported by numerical tests for wave
packets, non-local pure states, and for simple and random mixed states. The
tests are done in non-universal regimes in mixed phase space where detailed
features of fidelity are important. Although semiclassically motivated, present
approach is valid for abstract systems with a finite Hilbert basis provided
that the discrete Wigner transform is used. This makes the method applicable,
via a phase space approach, e. g., to problems of quantum computation.
