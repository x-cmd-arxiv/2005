  Properties","9 pages, 10 figures. Accepted for publication in PASJ",,"10.1093/pasj/57.4.611",,"astro-ph",,"  For 117 clusters of galaxies, we explore the detectability of intracluster
dust grains by current and future infrared facilities, taking into account both
collisional heating and sputtering of grains by ambient plasma. If the dust
grains are injected into the intergalactic space with the amount and size
comparable to the Galactic values, the dust-to-gas ratio is typically $10^{-6}$
and the mean dust temperature is $\sim 30$ K near the cluster center. The
predicted infrared intensities lie marginally above the detection thresholds
for Spitzer Space Telescope, ASTRO-F, Herschel and SPICA missions. For some
nearby clusters such as Perseus, A3571, A2319, A3112 and A2204, good detections
of intracluster dust signal are expected in the 70 $\mu$m band. Given rather
tight constraints on the dust temperature from observed electron density and
temperature, the dust mass can be inferred directly from the infrared
observations. Further constraints on the size distribution will be obtained
once multi-band data are available. They will definitely provide a powerful
probe of the dust injection processes and dust-gas interactions in the
intergalactic space.

colour-density relation, because their preferred habitat is different from that
of regular red-sequence galaxies, which are typically dust-poor, old and
passively evolving. The dusty red galaxies prefer the medium-density outskirts

which we can trace age-sensitive and dust-sensitive spectral features
independently with the detailed medium-band SED data. We find the red colour of
the dusty galaxies to be a result of dust extinction combined with relatively
old stellar ages. We speculate that the dusty red galaxies could either be a
product of minor mergers between established old red cluster galaxies with
infalling blue field galaxies, or mark a period in the internal transformation
of blue field galaxies into red cluster galaxies, which is triggered by the
environmental influences experienced during cluster infall.

non-radial oscillation equations with a forcing term and searching for resonant
response to a complex forcing frequency. By using the traditional approximation
the solution of the forced oscillation equations becomes separable, whereby the
energy equation is made separable by approximation. It is found that the
kappa-mechanism in rotating B-stars can destabilize not only gravity- or
pressure modes, but also a branch of low frequency retrograde (in corotating
frame) oscillations in between the retrograde g-modes and toroidal r-modes.
These unstable quasi g-modes (or `q-modes') hardly exhibit rotational
confinement to the equatorial regions of the star, while the oscillations are
always prograde in the observer's frame, all in contrast to g-modes. The
unstable q-modes occur in a few narrow period bands (defined by their azimuthal
index m), and seem to fit the oscillation spectra observed in SPB stars rather
well. The unstable q-mode oscillation spectrum of a very rapidly rotating 8
M_sun star appears similar to that of the well studied Be-star mu Cen. The
unstable q-modes thus seem far better in explaining the observed oscillation
spectra in SPB-stars and Be-stars than normal g-modes.

the shock parameters of forward/reverse shocks are taken to be quite different.
The other is a so called ""late internal shock model"", which requires a
refreshed unsteady relativistic outflow generated after the prompt $\gamma-$ray
emission. In the forward-reverse shock model, after the time $t_\times$ at
which the RS crosses the ejecta, the flux declines more slowly than
$(t_\oplus/t_\times)^{-(2+\beta)}$, where $t_\oplus$ denotes the observer's
time and $\beta$ is the spectral index of the X-ray emission. In the ``late

$t_{\rm e, \oplus}$ and the observed variability timescale of the X-ray flare

rapidly fragments into clumps. We resolve the dynamics of the strong shear
layer which defines the side walls of the cavity. We conjecture that this layer
is the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotational
properties. The shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edge
retains its angular momentum. This rotation is roughly consistent with that
observed in the Source I SiO maser spots. The observed proper motions and
line-of-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. The cavity

  Beyond 2015, very ambitious space (Darwin/TPF) and ground (OWL) experiments
are targeting direct detection of nearby Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone and the measurement of their spectral characteristics. Beyond these, `Life
Finder' (aiming to produce confirmatory evidence of the presence of life) and
`Earth Imager' (some massive interferometric array providing resolved images of
a distant Earth) appear as distant visions.
  This report, to ESA and ESO, summarises the direction of exo-planet research
that can be expected over the next 10 years or so, identifies the roles of the
major facilities of the two organisations in the field, and concludes with some
recommendations which may assist development of the field.
  The report has been compiled by the Working Group members and experts over
the period June-December 2004.

(COUP), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 days
of ACIS integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616
detected sources in the 17x17 arcmin field of view. We here focus on a
subsample of 233 X-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. We search
for X-ray modulation using the Lomb Normalized Periodogram method.
  X-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23
stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from
20% to 70%. In 16 cases, the X-ray modulation period is similar to the stellar
rotation period while in seven cases it is about half that value, possibly due
to the presence of X-ray emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes.
These results constitute the largest sample of low mass stars in which X-ray
rotational modulation has been observed. The detection of rotational modulation
indicates that the X-ray emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously in
longitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellar
radius. Modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels
(L_X/L_bol ~ 10^(-3)) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of the
stellar surface with X-ray emitting regions.

bias their relative positions by no more than a couple of tens of

A maximum X-ray luminosity of 1.5 x 10^{29} erg s$^{-1}$ is derived in the

samples of stars of similar effective temperature in NGC 2264 and in the Orion

that the visible component rotates rather slowly for a weak-lined T Tauri star

the presence of a two-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ $\sim$ 1 keV and 5 keV)
near the center of the SNR. The central region is dominated by emission from
highly-ionized Fe-rich ejecta. We estimate a conservative upper limit on the
total Fe ejecta mass of the SNR, M$_{Fe}$ $<$ 0.27 M$_{\odot}$. Comparisons
with standard SN nucleosynthesis models suggest that this Fe mass limit is
consistent with a Type II SN explosion for the origin of Sgr A East. On the
other hand, the soft X-ray emission extending toward the north of the SNR can
be described by a single-temperature ($kT$ $\sim$ 1.3 keV) thermal plasma with
normal chemical composition. This portion of the SNR is thus X-ray emission
from the heated interstellar medium rather than the metal-rich stellar ejecta.
We point out that a hard pointlike source CXOGC J174545.5$-$285829 (the
so-called ``cannonball'') at the northern edge of the SNR shows unusual X-ray
characteristics among other Galactic center sources. The morphological,

orientations, and the amount of substructure of each cluster, and compare the
lensing weighted distribution of each quantity to that of the cluster
population as a whole. The concentrations of lensing clusters are on average
34% larger than the typical cluster in the Universe. Despite this bias, the
anomalously high concentrations (c >14) recently measured by several groups,
appear to be inconsistent with the concentration distribution in our
simulations, which predict < 2% of lensing clusters should have concentrations
this high. No correlation is found between lensing cross section and the amount
of substructure. We introduce several types of simplified dark matter halos,
and use them to isolate which properties of CDM clusters make them effective
lenses. Projections of halo substructure onto small radii and the large scale
mass distribution of clusters do not significantly influence cross sections.
The abundance of giant arcs is primarily determined by the mass distribution
within an average overdensity of ~ 10,000. A multiple lens plane ray tracing
algorithm is used to show that projections of large scale structure increase
the giant arc abundance by a modest amount <7%. We revisit the question of
whether there is an excess of giant arcs behind high redshift clusters in the

good agreement with LCDM, although our simulations predict more low redshift (z

variations are superposed. In particular, in the period from 1961 to 1983 the
mean brightness of S5 0716+714 remained significantly fainter than that
observed after 1994. Assuming a constant variation rate of the mean magnitude
we can estimate a value of about 0.11 magnitude/year. The simultaneous
occurrence of decreasing ejection velocities of superluminal moving components
in the jet reported by Bach et al. (2005) suggests that both phenomena are
related to the change of the direction of the jet to the line of sight from
about 5 to 0.7 degrees for an approximately constant bulk Lorentz factor of
about 12. A simple explanation is that of a precessing relativistic jet, which
should presently be close to the smallest orientation angle. One can therefore
expect in the next ten years a decrease of the mean brightness of about 1
magnitude.

of magnetic flux. Theoretical models considering magnetised stellar winds
however often presume uniform surface magnetic fields, characterised by a
single magnetic field strength. The present work investigates the impact of
non-uniform surface magnetic field distributions on the stellar mass and
angular momentum loss rates. The approach of Weber & Davis (1967) is extended
to non-equatorial latitudes to quantify the impact of latitude-dependent
magnetic field distributions over a large range of stellar rotation rates and
thermal wind properties. The analytically prescribed field patterns are
dominated by magnetic flux concentrations at intermediate and high latitudes.
The global stellar mass loss rates are found to be rather insensitive to
non-uniformities of the surface magnetic field. Depending on the non-uniformity
of the field distribution, the angular momentum loss rates deviate in contrast
at all rotation rates between -60% and 10% from the Weber & Davis-values, and
the effective Alfvenic radii up to about +/-25%. These large variations albeit
equal amounts of total magnetic flux indicate that a classification of stellar
surface magnetic fields through a single field strength is insufficient, and
that their non-uniformity has to be taken into account. The consequences for
applications involving magnetised stellar winds are discussed in view of the
rotational evolution of solar-like stars and of the observational determination
of their mass loss rates using the terminal velocity and ram pressure of the
wind. For rapidly rotating stars the latitudinal variation of the wind ram
pressure is found to exceed, depending on the actual field distribution on the
stellar surface, over two orders of magnitude.

we study one of the more general problems, known as LCP (largest common point
set problem): Let $\PP$ and $\QQ$ be two point sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and let
$\epsilon \geq 0$ be a tolerance parameter, the problem is to find a rigid
motion $\mu$ that maximizes the cardinality of subset $\II$ of $Q$, such that
the Hausdorff distance $\distance(\PP,\mu(\II)) \leq \epsilon$. We denote the
size of the optimal solution to the above problem by $\LCP(P,Q)$. The problem
is called exact-LCP for $\epsilon=0$, and \tolerant-LCP when $\epsilon>0$ and
the minimum interpoint distance is greater than $2\epsilon$. A
$\beta$-distance-approximation algorithm for tolerant-LCP finds a subset $I
\subseteq \QQ$ such that $|I|\geq \LCP(P,Q)$ and $\distance(\PP,\mu(\II)) \leq
\beta \epsilon$ for some $\beta \ge 1$.

called {\DA}, which gives the fastest known deterministic
4-distance-approximation algorithm for \tolerant-LCP. (2) For the exact-LCP,
when the matched set is required to be large, we give a simple sampling
strategy that improves the running times of all known deterministic algorithms,
yielding the fastest known deterministic algorithm for this problem. (3) We use
expander graphs to speed-up the \DA algorithm for \tolerant-LCP when the size
of the matched set is required to be large, at the expense of approximation in
the matched set size. Our algorithms also work when the transformation $\mu$ is
allowed to be scaling transformation.

throughput-delay tradeoff of the multicast channel in a single cell system. To
illustrate the main ideas, we start with the single group case, i.e., pure
multicast, where a common information stream is requested by all the users. We
consider three classes of scheduling algorithms with progressively increasing
complexity. The first class strives for minimum complexity by resorting to a
static scheduling strategy along with memoryless decoding. Our analysis for
this class of scheduling algorithms reveals the existence of a static
scheduling policy that achieves the optimal scaling law of the throughput at
the expense of a delay that increases exponentially with the number of users.
The second scheduling policy resorts to a higher complexity incremental
redundancy encoding/decoding strategy to achieve a superior throughput-delay
tradeoff. The third, and most complex, scheduling strategy benefits from the
cooperation between the different users to minimize the delay while achieving
the optimal scaling law of the throughput. In particular, the proposed
cooperative multicast strategy is shown to simultaneously achieve the optimal
scaling laws of both throughput and delay. Then, we generalize our scheduling
algorithms to exploit the multi-group diversity available when different
information streams are requested by different subsets of the user population.
Finally, we discuss the effect of the potential gains of equipping the base
station with multi-transmit antennas and present simulation results that
validate our theoretical claims.

i.e. observations come in one by one, and the predictor is allowed to update
his state of mind after each time step. We identify two ways of predicting by
MDL for this setup, namely a static} and a dynamic one. (A third variant,
hybrid MDL, will turn out inferior.) We will prove that under the only
assumption that the data is generated by a distribution contained in the model
class, the MDL predictions converge to the true values almost surely. This is
accomplished by proving finite bounds on the quadratic, the Hellinger, and the
Kullback-Leibler loss of the MDL learner, which are however exponentially worse
than for Bayesian prediction. We demonstrate that these bounds are sharp, even

unconventional point of view, to the study of asymptotically flat solutions of
Einstein equations. The essential observation is that from a given
asymptotically flat space-time with a given Bondi shear, one can find (by
integrating a partial differential equation) a class of asymptotically
shear-free (but, in general, twistiing) null geodesic congruences. The class is
uniquely given up to the arbitrary choice of a complex analytic world-line in a
four-parameter complex space. Surprisingly this parameter space turns out to be
the H-space that is associated with the real physical space-time under
consideration. The main development in this work is the demonstration of how
this complex world-line can be made both unique and also given a physical
meaning. More specifically by forcing or requiring a certain term in the
asymptotic Weyl tensor to vanish, the world-line is uniquely determined and
becomes (by several arguments) identified as the `complex center-of-mass'.
Roughly, its imaginary part becomes identified with the intrinsic spin-angular
momentum while the real part yields the orbital angular momentum.

reduces the large discrepancy between theory and experiment. With $m_c=1.4{\rm

study inclusive production of a quarkonium. It is widely used and successful.
However, a recent study of gluon fragmentation into a quarkonium at two-loop
level shows that the factorization is broken. It is suggested that the
color-octet NRQCD matrix elements should be modified by adding a gauge link to
restore the factorization. The modified matrix elements may have extra
soft-divergences at one-loop level which the unmodified can not have, and this
can lead to a violation of the universality of these matrix elements. In this
letter, we examine in detail the NRQCD factorization for inclusive quarkonium
production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation at one-loop level. Our results show that
the factorization can be made without the modification of NRQCD matrix elements
and it can also be made for relativistic corrections. It turns out that the
suggested gauge link will not lead to nonzero contributions to color-octet
NRQCD matrix elements at one-loop level and at any order of $v$. Therefore the
universality holds at least at one-loop level.

  Revisiting Heavy Neutrinos","36 pages, 10 figures and 1 table, references fixed",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph",,"  A simple and well-motivated explanation for the origin of dark matter is that
it consists of thermal relic particles that get their mass entirely through
electroweak symmetry breaking. The simplest models implementing this
possibility predict a dark matter candidate that consists of a mixture of two
Dirac neutrinos with opposite isospin, and so has suppressed coupling to the Z.
These models predict dark matter masses of m_{DM}~45 GeV or m_{DM}~90-95 GeV
and WIMP-neutron spin-independent cross sections
\sigma_{WIMP-n}~10^{-6}-10^{-8} pb. Current direct dark matter searches are
probing a portion of the parameter space of these models while future
experiments sensitive to \sigma_{WIMP-n}~10^{-8} pb will probe the remainder.
An enhancement of the galactic halo gamma ray and positron flux coming from
annihilations of these particles is also expected across the ~1-100 GeV range.
The framework further suggests an environmental explanation of the hierarchy
between the weak and Planck scales and of the small value of the cosmological
constant relative to the weak scale.

$A_5$, $A_6$, and $A_7$ until $M_s$ exceeds a certain value that is larger than
the gCFL onset. We then handle mixing between color-diagonal gluons $A_3$,
$A_8$, and photon $A_\gamma$, and clarify that, among three eigenvalues of the
mass squared matrix, one remains positive, one is always zero because of an
unbroken $U(1)_\tilde{Q}$ symmetry, and one exhibits chromomagnetic instability
in the gCFL region. We also examine the temperature effects that bring
modifications into the Meissner masses. The instability found at large $M_s$
for $A_4$, $A_5$, $A_6$, and $A_7$ persists at finite $T$ into the $u$-quark
color superconducting (uSC) phase which has $u$-$d$ and $s$-$u$ but no $d$-$s$

distance between states of a quantum system. The purpose of this paper is to
explore these as regularizing functionals in seeking solutions to
multi-variable and multi-dimensional moment problems. It will be shown that
extrema can be effectively constructed via a suitable homotopy. The homotopy
approach leads naturally to a further generalization and a description of all
the solutions to such moment problems. This is accomplished by a
renormalization of a Riemannian metric induced by entropy functionals. As an
application we discuss the inverse problem of describing power spectra which
are consistent with second-order statistics, which has been the main motivation

The distributions of returns that appear in the model can be Gaussian as well

Markov chain model. This model in some aspects is similar to well-known Ising
model describing ferromagnetics. Namely we consider a set of N investors, each
of whom has either bullish or bearish opinion, denoted by plus or minus
respectively. At every time step each of N investors can change his/her sign.
The probability of a plus becoming a minus and the probability of a minus
becoming a plus depends only on the bullish sentiment described as the number
of bullish investors among the total of N investors. The number of bullish
investors then forms a Markov chain whose transition matrix is calculated
explicitly. The transition matrix of that chain is ergodic and any initial
distribution of bullish investors converges to stationary. Stationary
distributions of bullish investors in this Markov chain model are similar to
continuous distributions of the ""theory of social imitation"" of Callen and
Shapero. Distributions obtained this way can represent 3 types of market
behavior: one-peaked distribution that is close to Gaussian, transition market
(flattening of the top), and two-peaked distribution.

discretization are factors that let the lattice Boltzmann framework (LBM) far
away from its conceptual support: the continuous Boltzmann equation (BE). Most
collision models are based on the BGK, single parameter, relaxation-term
leading to constant Prandtl numbers. The polynomial expansion used for the
equilibrium distribution introduces an upper-bound in the local macroscopic
speed. Most widely used time discretization procedures give an explicit
numerical scheme with second-order time step errors. In thermal problems,
quadrature did not succeed in giving discrete velocity sets able to generate
multi-speed regular lattices. All these problems, greatly, difficult the
numerical simulation of LBM based algorithms. In present work, the systematic
derivation of lattice-Boltzmann models from the continuous Boltzmann equation
is discussed. The collision term in the linearized Boltzmann equation is
modeled by expanding the distribution function in Hermite tensors.
Thermohydrodynamic macroscopic equations are correctly retrieved with a
second-order model. Velocity discretization is the most critical step in
establishing regular-lattices framework. In the quadrature process, it is shown
that the integrating variable has an important role in defining the equilibrium
distribution and the lattice-Boltzmann model, leading, alternatively, to
temperature dependent velocities (TDV) and to temperature dependent weights
(TDW) lattice-Boltzmann models.

informational coherence is a measure of association and shared information

  I. Calculation of phase shift and Jost function","16 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Elegant and mathematically rigorous methods of the quantum inverse theory are
difficult to put into practice because there is always some lack of needful
input information. In this situation, one may try to construct a reference
potential, whose spectral characteristics would be in a reasonable agreement
with the available data of the system's properties. Since the reference
potential is fixed, it is always possible to calculate all its spectral
characteristics, including phase shift for scattering states and Jost function,
the main key to solve the inverse problem. Thereafter, one can calculate a
Bargmann potential whose Jost function differs from the initial one only by a
rational factor. This way it is possible, at least in principle, to construct a
more reliable potential for the system. The model system investigated in this
paper is diatomic xenon molecule in ground electronic state. Its reference
potential is built up of several smoothly joined Morse type components, which
enables to solve the related energy eigenvalue problem exactly. Moreover, the
phase shift can also be calculated in part analytically, and the Jost function
can be acertained very accurately in the whole range of positive energies. Full
energy dependence of the phase shift has been determined and its excellent
agreement with the Levinson theorem demonstrated. In addition, asymptotically
exact analytic formulas for the phase shift and the Jost function, independent
of each other, are obtained and their physical background elucidated.
