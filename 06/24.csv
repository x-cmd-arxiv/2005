and shear, using a joint distribution derived from galaxy formation models
calibrated by galaxy-galaxy lensing data and number counts of massive

probabilities, particularly at large image separations; the increase is ~30% at
\theta=3'' and ~200% at \theta=5'', when we adopt a power-law source luminosity
function \Phi(L) \propto L^-2.1. The enhancement is mainly driven by
convergence, which boosts both the image separation and magnification bias (for
a fixed lens galaxy mass). These effects have been neglected in previous
studies of lens statistics. Turning the problem around, we derive the posterior
convergence and shear distributions and point out that they are strong
functions of image separation; lens systems with larger image separations are
more likely to lie in dense environments.

dominated by perturbers found within a tidal radius of an image, and that
sizable magnification perturbations may arise from small, coherent
contributions from several substructures within the lens halo. We find that the
root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation of the magnification perturbation is 10% to
20% and both the average and rms perturbations are sensitive to the mass
spectrum and density profile of the perturbers. Interestingly, we find that
relative to a smooth model of the same mass, the average magnification in
clumpy models is lower (higher) than that in smooth models for positive
(negative) parity images. This is opposite from what is observed if one assumes
that the image magnification predicted by the best-fit smooth model of a lens
is a good proxy for what the observed magnification would have been if
substructures were absent. While it is possible for this discrepancy to be
resolved via nonlinear perturbers, we argue that a more likely explanation is
that the assumption that the best-fit lens model is a good proxy for the
magnification in the absence of substructure is not correct. We conclude that a
better theoretical understanding of the predicted statistical properties of
magnification perturbations by CDM substructure is needed in order to affirm

collimated outflow (jet), undergoing lateral spreading. Wider opening GRB
ejecta with a non-uniform energy angular distribution (structured outflows) or
the cessation of energy injection in the afterglow can also yield light-curve
breaks.
  We determine the optical and X-ray light-curve decay indices and spectral
energy distribution slopes for 10 GRB afterglows with optical light-curve
breaks (980519, 990123, 990510, 991216, 000301, 000926, 010222, 011211, 020813,
030226), and use these properties to test the above models for light-curve
steepening. It is found that the optical breaks of six of these afterglows can
be accommodated by either energy injection or by structured outflows. In the
refreshed shock model, a wind-like stratification of the circumburst medium (as
expected for massive stars as GRB progenitors) is slightly favoured. A
spreading jet interacting with a homogeneous circumburst medium is required by
the afterglows 990510, 000301, 011211, and 030226. The optical pre- and
post-break decays of these four afterglows are incompatible with a wind-like
medium.
  The current sample of 10 afterglows with breaks suggests that the
distribution of the break magnitude (defined as the increase of the afterglow
decay exponent) is bimodal, with a gap at 1. If true, this bimodality favours
the structured outflow model, while the gap location indicates a homogeneous
circumburst environment.

is efficiently heated by dynamical friction (DF) of galaxies. We allow for both
subsonic and supersonic motions of galaxies and use the gravitational drag
formula in a gaseous medium presented by Ostriker (1999). The energy lost by
the galaxies is either redistributed locally or into a Gaussian centered on the
galaxy. We find that the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and strict energy
balance yields a trivial isothermal solution T_iso, independent of radius, or
rising temperature distributions provided T_iso/gamma < T < T_iso, where gamma
is the adiabatic index of the gas. The isothermal temperature corresponds to
the usual scaling relation between the gas temperatures and the velocity
dispersions of galaxies. However the minimal temperature associated with the
rising solutions is ~ 0.5 T_vir, larger than that inferred from observations,
the radial distribution of galaxy masses notwithstanding. Heating by
supersonically moving galaxies cannot suppress thermal instability, although it
can lengthen the growth time up to the level comparable to the ages of clusters
when Mach number of galaxies is less than about two. We show using numerical
hydrodynamic simulations that DF-induced heating is generally unable to produce
stable equilibrium cores by evolving arbitrary non-equilibrium clusters,
although it can lengthen the cooling time. We conclude that DF-induced heating
alone is an unlikely solution to the cooling flow problem, although it can
still be an important heat supplier, considerably delaying cooling catastrophe.
We discuss other potential consequences of DF of galaxies in galaxy clusters.

These modes can be regarded as a hybrid between the Rossby modes that arise
from conservation of vorticity, and the Poincare modes that are gravity waves
modified by the Coriolis force. Using a non-adiabatic pulsation code based
around the traditional approximation, I find that the modes are unstable in
mid- to late-B type stars, due to the same iron-bump opacity mechanism usually
associated with SPB and $\beta$ Cep stars. At one half of the critical rotation
rate, the instability for $m=1...4$ modes spans the spectral types B4 to A0.
Inertial-frame periods of the unstable modes range from 100 days down to a
fraction of a day, while normalized growth rates can reach in excess of
$10^{-5}$.
  I discuss the relevance of these findings to SPB and pulsating Be stars, and
to the putative Maia class of variable star. I also outline some of the
questions raised by this discovery of a wholly-new class of pulsational
instability in early-type stars.

Thus the sputtered particle creates a cascade of collisions in the atmosphere

demonstrated by fitting broad band data and detailed Spitzer spectra of

Hidden Broad Line Regions are shown. Their SED enable us to separate the
contributions from the dusty disc of the AGN and the starbursts. The composite
model is consistent with the unified scheme and the idea that the infrared
emission of AGN is dominated in the MIR and starbursts in the FIR. According to
the unified scheme, the observed diversity of AGN properties results from the
different orientations relative to our line of sight. The strong resonance of
silicate dust at 10mic is therefore, as expected, seen in absorption towards
many type-2 AGN. In type-1 AGN, it should be seen in emission because the hot
inner surface of the dust torus becomes visible. However, this has not been
observed so far, thus challenging the unification scheme or leading to exotic

abundances were obtained from spectral synthesis of one Eu II line that takes
into account HFS from a series of recent laboratory measurements. For the lines
analyzed in this study, we find that for manganese, the differences between

abundances are even less sensitive to the choice of HFS than Mn, presenting a
0.07 dex maximum difference between determinations with different HFSs.
However, the cobalt HFS data from different sources are significantly
different. Our abundance results for Mn offer an independent confirmation of
the results from Prochaska & McWilliam (2000), who favour type Ia supernovae as
the main nucleosynthesis site of Mn production, in contrast to trends of Mn
versus metallicity previously reported in the literature. For Co, we obtain
[Co/Fe] ~ 0.0 in the range -0.3 < [Fe/H] < +0.3 and [Co/Fe] rising to a level
of +0.2 when [Fe/H] decreases from -0.3 to -0.8, in disagreement with recent
results in the literature. The observed discrepancies may be attributed to the
lack of HFS in the works we used for comparison. Our results for Eu are in
accordance with low-mass type II supernovae being the main site of the
r-process nucleosynthesis.

numerical simulations we investigate the geometrical properties of accretion.
To span the scale range required in these simulations we have developed a new
numerical technique: the multi-zoom method. We run a series of Tree-SPH
simulations in smaller and smaller boxes at higher and higher mass resolution,
using data recorded at the previous level to account for the matter inflow and
the tidal field from outside matter. The code is parallelized using OpenMP. We
present a validation test to evaluate the robustness of the method: the pancake
collapse. We apply this new multizoom method to study the accretion properties.
Zooming in onto galaxies from a cosmological simulation, we select a sample of
10 well resolved galaxies (5000 baryonic particles or more). We sum up their
basic properties and plot a Tully-Fisher relation. We find that smooth
accretion of intergalactic cold gas dominates mergers for the mass growth of
galaxies at z < 2. Next we study the baryonic accretion rate which shows
different behaviours depending on the galaxy mass. The bias is also computed at
different radii and epochs. Then we present galactocentric angular maps for the
accretion integrated between z=2 and z=0, which reveal that accretion is highly
anisotropic. Average accretion rates plotted against galactocentric latitude
show a variety of behaviours. In general, accretion in the galactic plane is
favored, even more for baryonic matter than for dark matter.

yellow symbiotic stars (YSyS). Samples of (suspected) metal-deficient barium
(mdBa) stars and YSyS have been collected from the literature, and their
properties reviewed. It appears in particular that the barium nature of the
suspected mdBa stars needs to be ascertained by detailed abundance analyses.
Abundances are therefore derived for two of them, HD 139409 and HD 148897,
which reveal that HD 148897 should not be considered a barium star. HD 139409
is a mild barium star, with overabundances observed only for elements belonging
to the first s-process peak (Y and Zr). The evidence for binarity among mdBa
stars is then reviewed, using three different methods: (i) radial-velocity
variations (from CORAVEL observations), (ii) Hipparcos astrometric data, and
(iii) a method based on the comparison between the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 proper
motions. A first-time orbit is obtained for HIP 55852, whereas evidence for the
(so far unknown) binary nature of HIP 34795, HIP 76605, HIP 97874 and HIP
107478 is presented. Two stars with no evidence for binarity whatsoever (HIP
58596 and BD +3 2688) are candidates low-metallicity thermally-pulsing
asymptotic giant branch stars, as inferred from their large luminosities. The
reason why mdBa stars are not YSyS is suggested to lie in their different
orbital period distributions: mdBa stars have on average longer orbital periods
than YSyS, and hence their companion accretes matter at a lower rate, for a
given mass loss rate of the giant star. The definite validation of this
explanation should nevertheless await the determination of the orbital periods
for the many mdBa stars still lacking periods, in order to make the comparison
more significant.

difficult to observe at visible wavelengths due to the overwhelming scattered
light contribution from Sirius A. However, from space we can take advantage of
the superb spatial resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope to resolve the A

the two stars has become increasingly favourable and we have recently been able
to obtain a spectrum of the complete Balmer line series for Sirius B using
HST?s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The quality of the STIS
spectra greatly exceed that of previous ground-based spectra, and can be used
to provide an important determination of the stellar temperature (Teff =
25193K) and gravity (log g = 8.556). In addition we have obtained a new, more
accurate, gravitational red-shift of 80.42 +/- 4.83 km s-1 for Sirius B.
Combining these results with the photometric data and the Hipparcos parallax we
obtain new determinations of the stellar mass for comparison with the
theoretical mass-radius relation. However, there are some disparities between
the results obtained independently from log g and the gravitational redshift
which may arise from flux losses in the narrow 50x0.2arcsec slit. Combining our
measurements of Teff and log g with the Wood (1995) evolutionary mass-radius
relation we get a best estimate for the white dwarf mass of 0.978 M. Within the
overall uncertainties, this is in agreement with a mass of 1.02 M obtained by
matching our new gravitational red-shift to the theoretical M/R relation.

vertical variation of the line ratios up to height of 2 kpc above the midplane.
The rising trends of the line ratios are matched. The increase in the line

to the progressive hardening of the radiation going through the gas. However an
extra heating above photoionization is needed to explain the absolute values.

methods. A correlation in resonance and transport properties of both compounds
is attributed to a similar mechanism of fine anion ordering (AO) at T_AO=200 K.
Due to the hydrogen bonds motif the small configuration changes in anion
sub-lattice bring a profound effect on electronic properties. It is shown that
the spin system of (BEDO-TTF)_2ReO_4*H_2O consists of a fraction of delocalized
pi-type holes (I_epr=n(e_F)), I_epr(300K)=1,62*10^(-4) emu/mol and
antiferromagnetically correlated local moments S=1/2, chi_p(300K)=1,86*10^(-3)
emu/mol. The phase transition Me-Me at T_AO=203 K is detected by paramagnetic
relaxation and resisitivity but it is not observed in spin susceptibility.
Fraction of delocalized holes gradually decreases by factor 2 at cooling down
to 100 K, whereas contribution from local moments reaches maximum at 50 K and
falls to zero at 14 K. However, at 2 K total spin susceptibility is fully
recovered approaching 6*10^(-2) emu/mol. In turn, (BEDT-TTF)_xDy(NO_3)_z does
not have solvent bridges (H_2O) between neighboring anions and the disorder in
anion layer converts this compound into paramagnetic insulator. Moreover, the
anion metal-complexes Dy(NO_3)_z^n(-) contain magnetic ions Dy^3(+).

compound: hopping local moments S=1/2 (BEDT-TTF^(+)), I_epr(300K)=6,3*10^(-4)

respect to the inclusion of fluctuations, as a Ginzburg criterion shows. On the
other hand, the self-consistent approach is shown to be valid only in the
thermodynamic limit, while for finite systems the critical behavior is found to
be different. In this last case, the self-consistent field itself is broadly
distributed rather than taking a well defined mean value; its fluctuations,
described by an effective zero-dimensional multiplicative noise equation,
govern the critical properties. These findings are obtained analytically for a
fully connected graph, and verified numerically both on fully connected graphs
and on random regular networks. The results presented here shed some doubt on
what is the validity and meaning of a standard mean-field approach in systems
with multiplicative noise in finite dimensions, where each site does not see an

renormalization group methods to analyze the low-energy behavior of the
electron system. This allows us to discern the growth of several response
functions for charge-density-wave modulations and for superconducting
instabilities with different order parameters. We show that, in the case of
single nanotubes exposed to screening by external gates, the Luttinger liquid
is unstable against the onset of a strong-coupling phase with very large
charge-density-wave correlations. The temperature of crossover to the new phase
depends crucially on the dielectric constant $\kappa $ of the environment,
ranging from $T_{C}\sim 10^{-4} {\rm K}$ (at $\kappa \approx 1$) up to a value
$T_{C} \sim 10^{2} {\rm K}$ (reached from $\kappa \approx 10$). The physical
picture is however different when we consider the case of a large array of
nanotubes, in which there is a 3D screening of the Coulomb interaction over
distances much larger than the intertube separation. The electronic instability
is then triggered by the divergence of one of the charge stiffnesses in the

surface of water, a model system to understand polymer physics on two
dimensions. A recently introduced technique is applied here to to study
viscoelasticity of PVAc monolayers. The method is based on measurement of
surface tension in two orthogonal directions during anisotropic deformation.
Compression and shear moduli are explored over a very large concentration
range, highlighting a series of four different regimes. At low concentration
the polymers are in a dilute gas. Above the overlap concentration $\Gamma^\ast$
there is a fluid semi-dilute region, where the monolayer properties are
described by scaling laws. At a threshold concentration $\Gamma^{\ast\ast}$, a
decrease in the gradient of pressure with concentration is observed, and we
argue that there is still a large fraction of free area on the surface.
Compressing further, we then identify close packing as the point where the
pressure gradient rises sharply and a shear modulus emerges. This is
interpreted as a transition to a soft-solid due to the kinetic arrest of
close-packed monomers. The reological properties of PVAc above
$\Gamma^{\ast\ast}$ have not been studied previously. Discussion includes
possible explanations for the observed behaviour in terms of both equilibrium
and non-equilibrium conditions, and the relation to microscopic chain
properties. Temperature dependent effects around $\Gamma^{\ast\ast}$ are also

delta-potentials (a delta-comb) or narrow Gaussian potentials. For the
delta-comb the time-independent nonlinear Schroedinger equation can be solved
analytically in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and thus provides useful
insight into the features of nonlinear stationary states of periodic
potentials. Phenomena well-known from classical chaos are found, such as a
bifurcation of periodic stationary states and a transition to spatial chaos.
The relation of new features of nonlinear Bloch bands, such as looped and
period doubled bands, are analyzed in detail. An analytic expression for the
critical nonlinearity for the emergence of looped bands is derived. The results
for the delta-comb are generalized to a more realistic potential consisting of
a periodic sequence of narrow Gaussian peaks and the dynamical stability of
periodic solutions in a Gaussian comb is discussed.

Density Wave (CDW) phases of the system are considered. Under a Jordan-Wigner
transformation, the system is equivalent to a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with a
weakened exchange coupling. We find that the persistent current changes from an
algebraic to an exponential decay with the system size, as the system crosses
from the LL to the CDW phase with increasing interaction $U$. We also find that
in the interacting system the persistent current is invariant under the

results from two combined effects : (i) the threshold rheology of
nanometer-thick junctions jammed under confinement into a soft glassy structure
(ii) geometric aging, i.e. slow growth of the real arrea of contact via
asperity creep interrupted by sliding.
  Closer analysis leads to identifying a second aging-rejuvenation process, at
work within the junctions themselves. We compare the effects of structural
aging at such multicontact, very highly confined, interfaces with those met
under different confinement levels, namely boundary lubricated contacts and
extended adhesive interfaces involving soft materials (hydrogels, elastomers).
This leads us to propose a classification of frictional junctions in terms of
the relative importance of jamming and adsoprtion-induced metastability.

the ""Generalized Uncertainty Principle"" often attributed to string theory in
the literature, also suggests that the emergence of a DSR Minkowski limit might
be inevitable. I discuss a possible link between this observation and recent
results on logarithmic corrections to the entropy-area black-hole formula, and
I observe that both the analysis here reported and Smolin's analysis appear to
suggest that the examples of DSR Minkowski limits for which a formalism has
been sought in the literature might not be sufficiently general. I also stress
that, as we now contemplate the hypothesis of a DSR Minkowski limit, there is
an additional challenge for those in the quantum-gravity community attributing
to the Planck length the role of ""fundamental length scale"".

dependence of the parton energy loss due to elastic scatterings in a parton

calculate the energy and length dependence of the fractional energy loss.

The effect of the superradiant scattering in the spectra is carefully examined.
It is shown that the low-energy limit of the total absorption cross section
always equal to the area of the non-spherically symmetric horizon, {\it i.e.}
$4\pi (r_H^2 + a^2)$ for the brane scalar and $2\pi^2 (r_H^2 + a^2) (r_H^2 +

amplification for the bulk scalar is roughly order of $10^{-9} %$ while that
for the brane scalar is order of unity. This indicates that the effect of the
superradiance is negligible for the case of the bulk scalar. Thus the standard
claim that {\it black holes radiate mainly on the brane} is not changed
although the effect of the superradiance is taken into account. The physical
implication of this fac t is discussed in the context of TeV-scale gravity.

shown that UCOM-RPA correlations induced by collective nuclear vibrations
recover a part of the residual long-range correlations that are not explicitly
included in the UCOM Hartree-Fock ground state. Both RPA models are employed in
studies of the isoscalar monopole resonance (ISGMR) in closed-shell nuclei
across the nuclide chart, with an emphasis on the sensitivity of its properties
on the constraints for the range of the UCOM correlation functions. Within the
Relativistic Quasiparticle RPA (RQRPA) based on Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov
model, the occurrence of pronounced low-lying dipole excitations is predicted
in nuclei towards the proton drip-line. From the analysis of the transition
densities and the structure of the RQRPA amplitudes, it is shown that these
states correspond to the proton pygmy dipole resonance.

produce a relative lag leading to the same phase shift as predicted by Aharonov

this lag aspect implied by the classical analysis but not present in the

  Constrained-Search--Variational Method","26 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.72.032505",,"physics.chem-ph physics.atom-ph",,"  In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{93}, 130401 (2004)], we proposed
the idea of expanding the space of variations in variational calculations of
the energy by considering the approximate wave function $\psi$ to be a
functional of functions $ \chi: \psi = \psi[\chi]$ rather than a function. The
space of variations is expanded because a search over the functions $\chi$ can
in principle lead to the true wave function. As the space of such variations is
large, we proposed the constrained-search-- variational method whereby a
constrained search is first performed over all functions $\chi$ such that the
wave function functional $\psi[\chi]$ satisfies a physical constraint such as
normalization or the Fermi-Coulomb hole sum rule, or leads to the known value
of an observable such as the diamagnetic susceptibility, nuclear magnetic
constant or Fermi contact term. A rigorous upper bound to the energy is then
obtained by application of the variational principle. A key attribute of the
method is that the wave function functional is accurate throughout space, in
contrast to the standard variational method for which the wave function is
accurate only in those regions of space contributing principally to the energy.
In this paper we generalize the equations of the method to the determination of
arbitrary Hermitian single-particle operators as applied to two-electron atomic
and ionic systems. The description is general and applicable to both ground and
excited states. A discussion on excited states in conjunction with the theorem
of Theophilou is provided.

acceleration. It is also conjectured that (fictitious) spinning Black Holes
(BH) could be sites of cosmic particle acceleration. However, it has been shown
by Mitra and Leiter and Robertson that General Relativity (GR) actually does
not allow the existence or formation of finite mass BHs. It was predicted that
the BH Candiadates (BHCs) have strong intrinsic magnetic fields (like pulsars)
instead of Event Horizons. And this prediction has tentatively been verified in
a series of papers by Robertson & Leiter. Thus all observed BH Candidates are
actually not BHs, and, they are expected to be MECOs. Stellar mass MECOs are GR
analogs of conventionally known isolated pulsars. While pulsars are/have (i)
COLD, i.e., not supported by radiation pressure, MECOs are HOT, i.e., supported
primarily by trapped radiation pressure, (ii) upper mass limit of 3-4 Msolar
MECOs, being HOT, have no Upper Mass Limit, (iii) surface gravitational red
shift, z ~ 0.1 -0.2, MECOs have z >> 1 so that photons can remain almost
permanently trapped inside them, (iv) magnetic field B <10^{13} G, for MECOs
the local value of B >> 10^{13} G. It may be recalled that isolated (non-
accreting) uncharged BHs are cold and dead objects without any physical
activity. On the other hand, isolated spinning MECOs are like extreme GR
pulsars.

energy $\cEco$ is expressed as an explicit functional of $\rho_1$, $v$, and

noninteracting, or reference, determinantal-state; $v$ is the external
potential from the interacting, or target, state; $v_s$ is the (kernel of the)
external potential from the noninteracting determinantal-state. In other words
we have $\cEco[\rho_1,v,v_s]$. Anther possibility is the following explicit
functional: $\cEco[\rho_1,v_{\text{co}},v_s]$, where $v_{\text{co}}$ is the
(kernel of the) correlation potential from the noninteracting Hamiltonian. The
proposed method can, in principle, be used to compute $\cEco$ in a very
accurate and efficient manner, since, like the Kohn--Sham approach, there are
no virtual orbitals to consider. However, in contrast to the Kohn--Sham
approach, $\cEco$ is a known, explicit functional that can be approximated in a
systematic manner. For simplicity, we only consider noninteracting closed-shell
states and target states that are nondegenerate, singlet ground-states; so, in
that case, $\rho_1$ denotes the spin-less one-particle density matrix from the
determinantal reference state.
