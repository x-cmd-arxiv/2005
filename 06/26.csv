(C2H5NH3)2CuCl4 are counted by using a novel nonlinear energy magnetometer. The
ILMs are produced by driving the uniform spin wave mode unstable with an
intense microwave pulse. Subsequently a subset of these ILMs become captured by
and locked to a cw driver so that their properties can be examined at a later
time with a tunable cw low power probe source. Four wave mixing is used to
enhance the emission signal from the few large amplitude ILMs over that
associated with the many small amplitude plane wave modes. A discrete step
structure observed in the emission signal is identified with individual ILMs
becoming unlocked from the driver. At most driver power and frequency settings
the resulting emission step structure appears uniformly distributed; however,
sometimes, nearby in parameter space, families of emission steps are evident as
the driver frequency or power is varied. Two different experimental methods
give consistent results for counting individual ILMs. Because of the
discreteness in the emission both the size of an ILM and its energy can be
estimated from these experiments. For the uniformly distributed case each ILM
extends over ~42 antiferromagnetic unit cells and has an energy value of
1.3x10^-12 [J] while for the case with families the ILM length becomes ~54
antiferromagnetic unit cells with an energy of 1.5x10^-12 [J]. An unresolved
puzzle is that the emission step height does not depend on experimental
parameters the way classical numerical simulations suggest.

supercomputers. The Yin-Yang geodynamo code has achieved 15.2 Tflops with 4096
processors on the Earth Simulator. This represents 46% of the theoretical peak
performance. The Yin-Yang mantle code has enabled us to carry out mantle
convection simulations in realistic regimes with a Rayleigh number of $10^7$
including strongly temperature-dependent viscosity with spatial contrast up to
$10^6$.

infectious diseases in a fixed-size population is proposed. The model consists
of a non-linear delay-differential equation describing the time evolution of
the increment in the number of infectious individuals and depends upon a
limited number of parameters. Predictions are in good qualitative agreement
with data on influenza.

$n=2,3$, which arise in the spatially homogeneous limit of the Yang-Mills (YM)
equations. These systems show strong stochasticity in the classical limit
($\hbar = 0$) and exhibit a quantum mechanical confinement feature. We
calculate the partition function $Z(t)$ going beyond the Thomas-Fermi (TF)
approximation by means of the semiclassical expansion using the Wigner-Kirkwood
(WK) method. We derive a novel compact form of the differential equation for
the WK function. After separating the motion in the channels of the
equipotential surface from the motion in the central region, we show that the
leading higher-order corrections to the TF term vanish up to eighth order in
$\hbar$, if we treat the quantum motion in the hyperbolic channels correctly by
adiabatic separation of the degrees of freedom. Finally, we obtain an
asymptotic expansion of the partition function in terms of the parameter
$g^2\hbar^4t^3$.

cavity QED. This is motivated on the recent observation that the quantum-state
swapping between a single-photon pulse and a Lambda-type atom trapped in a
cavity is ideally realized via scattering for some specific case in the strong
coupling cavity regime [T. W. Chen, C. K. Law, and P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev. A
69, 063810 (2004)]. We derive a simple formula for calculating the fidelity of
this atom-photon swapping for quantum memory. We further propose a feasible
method which implements conditionally the quantum memory operation with the
fidelity of almost unity even if the atom-photon coupling is not so strong.
This method can also be applied to store a photonic entanglement in spatially
separated atomic quantum memories.
