T-ReCS on Gemini South. The map includes the BN/KL region, the Trapezium, and
OMC-1 South. Excluding BN/KL, we detect 91 point sources, with 27 known
proplyds and over 30 ``naked'' stars showing no extended structure in HST
images. Within the region we surveyed, 80 percent of known proplyds show
detectable emission, almost 40 percent of naked stars are detected at 11.7
micron, and the fraction of all visible sources with IR excess emission is
roughly 50 percent. Thermal dust emission from stars with no extended structure
in HST images means that they have dust disks comparable to the size of our
solar system. Proplyds and stars with IR excess show a clear anti-correlation
in their spatial distribution, with proplyds clustered close to theta1C, and
other infrared sources found farther away. We suspect that the clustered
proplyds trace the youngest 0.5 Myr age group associated with the Trapezium,
while the more uniformly-distributed sources trace the older 1-2 Myr population
of the ONC. This suggests that small disks persist for a few Myr in irradiated
environments, and hints that hierarchical sub-clustering has been important.
Within 30 arcsec of theta1C, all proplyds are detected at 11.7 micron. The star
theta1D is associated with the most prominent mid-IR dust arc in the nebula. We
propose that this arc is the consequence of theta1D being the closest member of
the Trapezium to the background cloud. Finally, we detect dust emission from HH
jets in Orion, including HH202, HH529, HH513, and HH514. This is the first
detection of mid-IR continuum emission from dust in the body of a collimated HH
jet or bow shock.

and located in the Chandra Deep Field South to characterize the evolution of
the comoving infrared (IR) energy density of the Universe up to z~1. Using
published ancillary optical data we first obtain a nearly complete redshift
determination for the 24mic objects associated with R<24 counterparts at z<1.
We find that the 24mic population at 0.5<z<1 is dominated by ``Luminous
Infrared Galaxies'' (i.e., 10^11 L_sol < L_IR < 10^12 L_sol), the counterparts
of which appear to be also luminous at optical wavelengths and tend to be more
massive than the majority of optically-selected galaxies. We finally derive
15mic and total IR luminosity functions (LFs) up to z~1. In agreement with the
previous results from ISO and SCUBA and as expected from the MIPS source number
counts, we find very strong evolution of the contribution of the IR-selected
population with lookback time. Pure evolution in density is firmly excluded by
the data, but we find considerable degeneracy between strict evolution in
luminosity and a combination of increases in both density and luminosity (L*_IR
prop. to (1+z)^{3.2_{-0.2}^{+0.7}}, Phi*_IR prop. to
(1+z)^{0.7_{-0.6}^{+0.2}}). Our results imply that the comoving IR energy
density of the Universe evolves as (1+z)^(3.9+/-0.4) up to z~1 and that
galaxies luminous in the infrared (i.e., L_IR > 10^11 L_IR) are responsible for
70+/-15% of this energy density at z~1. Taking into account the contribution of
the UV luminosity evolving as (1+z)^~2.5, we infer that these IR-luminous
sources dominate the star-forming activity beyond z~0.7. The uncertainties
affecting these conclusions are largely dominated by the errors in the
k-corrections used to convert 24mic fluxes into luminosities.

produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that
of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the

SN 2002bf and SN 2004dt exhibit unusually high-velocity (HV) absorption lines.
SN 1997dt is probably somewhat subluminous, and SN 2003du is slightly
overluminous. We detect polarization modulations across strong lines in all
four objects, demonstrating that all are intrinsically polarized. However, the
nature and degree of the polarization varies considerably. Including all SNe Ia
studied thus far, the following order emerges in terms of increasing strength
of line-polarization features: ordinary/overluminous < subluminous < HV SNe Ia,
with the strength of the line-polarization features increasing from 0.2% in the
slightly overluminous SN 2003du to 2% in both of the HV SNe Ia in our study.
The most convincing explanation for the line polarization of all objects is
partial obscuration of the photosphere by clumps of intermediate-mass elements
(IMEs) forged in the explosion; the polarization characteristics of the HV SNe
Ia in particular effectively rule out a simple ellipsoidal asphericity as the
root cause of their line polarization. That SNe Ia are separable into different
groups based on their spectropolarimetric characteristics may help narrow down
progenitor possibilities and/or explosion physics. In particular, the recently
proposed gravitationally confined detonation model may provide an attractive
explanation for many of the observed polarization characteristics of HV SNe Ia.

mass spectrum among old X-ray transients formed in the galaxies. We show that
this underlying BH mass spectrum is modified by a weighting factor that is
related to the transient duty cycle and it generally depends on the BH mass and
XRB donor type (main-sequence, red-giant, or white-dwarf donors). A duty cycle
that depends on the binary mass-transfer rate relative to the critical rate for
transient behavior is most probably favored. We also find that the derived BH
mass spectrum slope depends on the strength of angular momentum loss due to
magnetic braking for main-sequence donors. More specifically, we find that, for
``standard'' magnetic braking, BH XRBs with red-giant donors dominate the
upper-end XLF; for weaker magnetic braking prescriptions main-sequence donors
are found to be dominant. In both cases the BH mass spectrum has a differential
slope of ~2.5 and an upper BH mass cut-off at ~20 Msun is needed to understand
the very brightest of the BH XRBs in elliptical galaxies. We expect that our
result will help to constrain binary population synthesis models and the
adopted relations between black holes and the masses of their progenitors.

small scales. The large-scale mid-infrared emission is asymmetric about the
peak of IRS 1, being more extended to the northwest than the southeast. The
position angle of the mid-infrared emission is similar to the position angle of
the linearly distributed methanol masers at this location which are thought to
trace a circumstellar disk. However, this position angle is also very similar
to that of the CO outflow in this region which appears to be centered on IRS 1.
We suggest that the large-scale extended mid-infrared emission is coming from
dust heated on the walls of the outflow cavities near the source. IRS 1 is also
elongated in the mid-infrared on a smaller scale, and this elongation is near
PERPENDICULAR to the axis of the CO outflow (and the linearly distributed
methanol masers). Because of its orientation with respect to the outflow and
its estimated size (R_disk~450AU at 11.7um), we propose that the small-scale

significance of the extinction-acceleration correlation has a random chance
probability of less than one in a million. The hypothesis that extinction
coefficients should be corrected empirically provides greatly improved fits to
both accelerating and non-accelerating models, with the independent feature of
eliminating any significant correlation of residuals.

gradient reflects merging history of early types. When an elliptical galaxy
goes through many merging events, the color gradient can be get less steep or
reversed due to mixing of stars. One simple way to measure color gradient is to
compare half-light radii in different bands. We have compared the optical and
near infrared half-light radii of 273 early-type galaxies from Pahre(1999). Not
surprisingly, we find that r$_{e}$(V)s (half-light radii measured in V-band)
are in general larger than r$_{e}$(K)s (half-light radii measured in K-band).
However, when divided into different environments, we find that elliptical
galaxies in the denser environment have gentler color gradients than those in
the less dense environment. Our finding suggests that elliptical galaxies in
the dense environment have undergone many merging events and the mixing of
stars through the merging have created the gentle color gradients.

km s-1 show a remarkably good correlation with the X-ray features, strongly
supporting the kinematic distance ~ 1 kpc derived by Fukui et al. (2003), as
opposed to 6 kpc previously claimed. In addition, we show that absorption of
X-rays is caused by local molecular gas at softer X-ray bands. Subsequent
measurements of the CO(J=3-2) made with the ASTE 10 m and CSO 10.4 m telescopes

conditions, most likely higher temperatures above ~ 30 K as compared to that of
the typical gas in low mass dark clouds. This is most likely caused by enhanced
heating by the high energy events in the SNR, where possible mechanisms include
heating by X-rays, gamma-rays, and/or cosmic ray protons, although we admit
additional radiative heating by young protostars embedded may be working as
well. In one of the CO peaks, we have confirmed the presence of broad molecular

thus stay longer on the surface. However, this porosity-driven extension may

of the gravitational collapse of an isothermal molecular cloud. The disk's
viscous evolution is integrated according to two parameterizations of
turbulence: The classical $\alpha$ representation and a $\beta$
parameterization, representative of non-linear turbulence driven by the
keplerian shear. We apply the model to DM Tau and GM Aur, two classical T-Tauri
stars with relatively well-characterized disks, retrieving the evolution of
their surface density with time. We perform a systematic Monte-Carlo
exploration of the parameter space (i.e. values of the $\alpha$-$\beta$
parameters, and of the temperature and rotation rate in the molecular cloud) to
find the values that are compatible with the observed disk surface density
distribution, star and disk mass, age and present accretion rate. We find that
the observations for DM Tau require $0.001<\alpha<0.1$ or $2\times
10^{-5}<\beta<5\times 10^{-4}$. For GM Aur, we find that the turbulent
viscosity is such that $4\times 10^{-4}<\alpha<0.01$ or $2\times
10^{-6}<\beta<8\times 10^{-5}$. These relatively large values show that an
efficient turbulent diffusion mechanism is present at distances larger than
$\sim 10 $AU. This is to be compared to studies of the variations of accretion
rates of T-Tauri stars versus age that mostly probe the inner disks, but also
yield values of $\alpha\sim 0.01$. We show that the mechanism responsible for

  puzzling optical properties","26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el",,"  A theory has been worked out for the cuprates, which is based on the major
features of their first-principles-derived electronic structure, including the
contribution of a large-U band. Within this theory the puzzling physics of the
cuprates is shown to be a behavior specific of their structure, within the
regime of a Mott transition. The translational symmetry within the CuO_2 planes
is disturbed by dynamical stripe-like inhomogeneities, which provide
quasi-one-dimensional segments where the large-U scenario of separation between
spin and charge is materialized. However, these charge carriers gain itineracy
only due to the coupling with electrons in the regions where spin and charge
are inseparable. Consequently a two-component scenario is obtained of heavy and
light charge carriers, which are coupled through spin carriers. The theory
could explain all the anomalous properties of the cuprates that were studied by
it, including those observed in transport, tunneling, ARPES, and
neutron-scattering results, the pairing mechanism and its symmetry, the
observed phase diagram, and the occurrence of intrinsic nanoscale
heterogeneity. Here this theory is applied to study a variety of puzzling
optical properties of the cuprates, and again provides a natural explanation,
for each property tested. This includes ""violations"" of the f-sum rule,
Tanner's law, Homes' law, Uemura's law, the behavior of the n/m^* ratio with

hand, for the exponentially-decaying coupling, there are no signals for

lower frequency region becomes more and more like that for quasi 2D. We

equations that determine the self-energy and the 2PI two-particle vertex
$\Phi^{(2)}$. Susceptibilities are calculated from the Bethe-Salpeter equation

at low energy in one-dimensional systems (for reasons that we discuss), it
reproduces the exact results both in the normal and ordered phases in
single-channel (i.e. mean-field) theories, as shown on the example of BCS
theory. The possibility to continue the RG flow into broken-symmetry phases is
an essential feature of the 2PI RG scheme and is due to the fact that the 2PI
two-particle vertex, contrary to its 1PI counterpart, is not singular at a
phase transition. Moreover, the normal phase RG equations can be directly used
to derive the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the thermodynamic potential near a

presence of a new interaction in gravitational theory, and, in its search,
LATOR goes a factor 30,000 beyond the present best result, Cassini's 2003 test.
The mission will also provide: ii) first measurement of gravity's non-linear
effects on light to ~0.01% accuracy; including both the Eddington \beta
parameter and also the spatial metric's 2nd order potential contribution (never
measured before); iii) direct measurement of the solar quadrupole moment J2

theory in a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) Yang-Mills theory. To facilitate
computations within this scheme, which proceed at every step without fixing the
gauge, we develop a set of diagrammatic techniques. As an initial test of the
formalism, the one-loop SU(N) Yang-Mills beta-function, beta_1, is computed,
and the standard, universal answer is reproduced. It is recognised that the
computational technique can be greatly simplified. Using these simplifications,
a partial proof is given that, to all orders in perturbation theory, the
explicit dependence of perturbative $\beta$-function coefficients, beta_n, on
certain non-universal elements of the manifestly gauge invariant ERG cancels
out. This partial proof yields an extremely compact, diagrammatic form for the
surviving contributions to arbitrary beta_n, up to a set of terms which are yet
to be dealt with. The validity of the compact expression is reliant on an
unproven assertion at the third loop order and above. Starting from the compact
expression for beta_n, we specialise to beta_2 and explicitly construct the set
of terms yet to be dealt with. From the resulting diagrammatic expression for
beta_2, we extract a numerical coefficient which, in the limit that the
coupling of one of the unphysical regulator fields is tuned to zero, yields the
standard, universal answer. Thus, we have performed the very first two-loop,
continuum calculation in Yang-Mills theory, without fixing the gauge.

jump-defects, where the conditions relating the fields on either side of a
defect are Backlund transformations frozen at the defect location. The purpose
of this article is to explore the extent to which this idea may be extended to
the quantum sine-Gordon model and how the striking features of the classical
model may translate to the quantum version. Assuming a positive defect
parameter there are two types of defect. One type, carrying even charge, is
stable, but the other type, carrying odd charge, is unstable and may be
considered as a resonant bound state of a soliton and a stable defect. The
scattering of solitons with defects is considered in detail, as is the
scattering of breathers, and in all cases the jump-defect is purely
transmitting. One surprising discovery concerns the lightest breather. Its
transmission factor is independent of the bulk coupling - a property
susceptible to a perturbative check, but not shared with any of the other
breathers. It is argued that classical jump-defects can move and some comments
are made concerning their quantum scattering matrix.

over F-terms or become comparable with them. Novel patterns emerge which can be
tested phenomenologically. In a mixed anomaly-D mediated scenario, the scalars
have masses from D-mediation, whereas gaugino masses are generated by anomaly
mediation. As an application of this analysis, we show that while the ""split
supersymmetry"" like mass spectrum with one fine tuned Higgs is not an automatic
outcome of these scenarios, explicit models can be constructed where it can be
realised. Finally, we show that large D-mediated supersymmetry breaking can be
realised in string models based on intersecting D-branes. Examples are
presented where the moduli are stabilised in the presence of large D-terms

in dynamical systems. The technique applies both to systems with conventional
Lyapunov-stable target dynamics and to ones of which the desired dynamics
around the target set is nonequilibrium and in general unstable in the Lyapunov
sense. Mathematical models of uncertainties are allowed to be nonlinearly
parametrized, smooth, and monotonic functions of linear functionals of the
parameters. We illustrate with applications how the proposed method leads to
control algorithms. In particular we show that the mere existence of nonlinear
operator gains for the desired dynamics guarantees that system solutions are
bounded, reach a neighborhood of the target set, and mismatches between the
modeled uncertainties and uncertainty compensator vanish with time. The
proposed class of algorithms can also serve as parameter identification
procedures. In particular, standard persistent excitation suffices to ensure
exponential convergence of the estimated to the actual values of the
parameters. When a weak, nonlinear version of the persistent excitation
condition is satisfied, convergence is asymptotic. The approach extends to a
broader class of parameterizations where the monotonicity restriction holds
only locally. In this case excitation with oscillations of sufficiently high
frequency ensure convergence.

have a (de)localization transition at some critical line in the phase diagram.
In this work we prove in particular that, as soon as disorder is present, the
transition is at least of second order, in the sense that the free energy is
differentiable at the critical line, so that the order parameter vanishes
continuously at the transition. On the other hand, it is known that the
corresponding non--disordered models can have a first order (de)localization
transition, with a discontinuous first derivative. Our result shows therefore
that the presence of the disorder has really a smoothing effect on the
transition. The relation with the predictions based on the Harris criterion is

obtained considering the contribution to detectors statistics of both the
pulsed source and the intrinsic neutron source. An expansion in
alpha-eigenvalues is derived for the final solution, which permits to take into
account the effect of higher harmonics in subcritical systems. Further,
expressions corresponding to the fundamental mode approximation are compared
with recent results from experiments performed under the MUSE-4 European
research project.

both analytically and numerically. Each cell in the organism becomes dead under
sufficiently strong stress, and is then allowed to be healed with some
probability. It is found that unlike the case of no healing, the organism in
general does not completely break down even in the presence of noise. Revealed
is the characteristic time evolution that the system tends to resist the stress
longer than the system without healing, followed by sudden breakdown with some
fraction of cells surviving. When the noise is weak, the critical stress beyond
which the system breaks down increases rapidly as the healing parameter is
raised from zero, indicative of the importance of healing in biological
systems.

cells, based on the exchange of membrane area between the cell membrane and a
membrane reservoir. The reservoir is composed of invaginated membrane
microdomains which are liable to flatten upon increase of membrane strain,
effectively controlling membrane tension. We show that the domain shape
transition is first order, allowing for coexistence between flat and
invaginated domains. During coexistence, the membrane tension is controlled by
the domains elasticity and by the kinetics of the shape transition. We show
that the tension of the plasma membrane of living cells is inherently transient
and dynamical, and that valuable insights into the organization of the cell
membrane can be obtained by studying the variation of the cell membrane tension
upon mechanical perturbation.

receivers the information encoded into an unknown coherent state. On one hand,
a local strategy is considered, consisting in a local cloning process followed
by direct transmission. On the other hand, a telecloning protocol based on
nonlocal quantum correlations is analyzed. Both the strategies are optimized to
minimize the detrimental effects due to losses and thermal noise along the
propagation. The comparison between the local and the nonlocal protocol shows
that telecloning is more effective than local cloning for a wide range of noise
parameters. Our results indicate that nonlocal strategies can be more robust
against noise than local ones, thus being suitable candidates to play a major
role in quantum information networks.

translationally invariant harmonic lattice systems with non-randon,
finite-range interactions. We show that the criticality of the system as well
as validity or break-down of the entanglement area law are solely determined by
the analytic properties of the spectral function of the oscillator system,
which can easily be computed. In particular for finite-range couplings we find
a one-to-one correspondence between an area-law scaling of the bi-partite
entanglement and a finite correlation length. This relation is strict in the
one-dimensional case and there is strog evidence for the multi-dimensional
case. We also discuss generalizations to couplings with infinite range.
Finally, to illustrate our results, a specific 1D example with nearest and
next-nearest neighbor coupling is analyzed.

Quantum Information 4, 105 (2006)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum information, though not precisely defined, is a fundamental concept
of quantum information theory which predicts many fascinating phenomena and
provides new physical resources. A basic problem is to recognize the features
of quantum systems responsible for those phenomena. One of such important
features is that non-commuting quantum states cannot be broadcast: two copies
cannot be obtained out of a single copy, not even reproduced marginally on
separate systems. We focus on the difference of information contents between
one copy and two copies which is a basic manifestation of the gap between
quantum and classical information. We show that if the chosen information
measure is the Holevo quantity, the difference between the information contents
of one copy and two copies is zero if and only if the states can be broadcast.
We propose a new approach in defining measures of quantumness of ensembles
based on the difference of information contents between the original ensemble
and the ensemble of duplicated states. We comment about the permanence property
of quantum states and the recently introduced superbroadcasting operation. We
also provide an Appendix where we discuss the status of quantum information in
quantum physics, basing on the so-called isomorphism principle.
