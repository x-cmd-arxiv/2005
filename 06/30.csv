  Parametric Resonance Mechanism","15 pages, 8 figures. Submitted to Phys. Rev. D",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  In this work we propose a new mechanism for photoproduction inside a neutron
star based on Parametric Resonance phenomenon as firstly applied to
Inflationary Cosmology. Our assumptions are based on the pion condensation
model by Harrington and Shepard. We show that a huge number of photons are
created which, on turns, reheats the matter in the star's core. Thus, we argue
that Parametric Resonance can be effective during a brief period out of an
neutron star lifetime leading to an anomalous uprising variation of its
brightness departing from the black body radiation at regularly spaced
frequencies. In adition, a time periodic signal is obtained in moderate (not
exponential) regimes. We argue also that our PR mechanism offers a simple and
feasible explanation for some recent observations of giant flares from neutron
stars.

cataclysmic variables, arguably encompassing the shortest orbital periods (down
to about 10 minutes) of any known binaries. Both binary components are thought
to be degenerate (or partially so), likely with mass-transfer from a
helium-rich donor onto a white dwarf, driven by gravitational radiation.
Although rare, AM CVn systems are of high interest as possible SN Ia
progenitors, and because they are predicted to be common sources of gravity
waves in upcoming experiments such as LISA. We have identified four new AM CVn
candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectral database. All four
show hallmark spectroscopic characteristics of the AM CVn class: each is devoid
of hydrogen features, and instead shows a spectrum dominated by helium. All
four show double-peaked emission, indicative of helium-dominated accretion
disks. Limited time-series CCD photometric follow-on data have been obtained
for three of the new candidates from the ARC 3.5m; most notably, a 28.3 minute
binary period with sharp, deep eclipses is discovered in one case, SDSS
J0926+3624. This is the first confirmed eclipsing AM CVn, and our data allow
initial estimates of binary parameters for this ultracompact system. The four
new SDSS objects also provide a substantial expansion of the currently
critically-small sample of AM CVn systems.

time. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method we perform a critical analysis
of the cosmological parameter space, allowing for a varying w. We use
constraints on w(z) from the observations of high redshift supernovae (SN), the
WMAP observations of CMB anisotropies and abundance of rich clusters of
galaxies. For models with a constant w, the LCDM model is allowed with a
probability of about 6% by the SN observations while it is allowed with a
probability of 98.9% by WMAP observations. The LCDM model is allowed even
within the context of models with variable w: WMAP observations allow it with a
probability of 99.1% whereas SN data allows it with 23% probability. The SN
data, on its own, favors phantom like equation of state (w<-1) and high values
for Omega_NR. It does not distinguish between constant w (with w<-1) models and
those with varying w(z) in a statistically significant manner. The SN data
allows a very wide range for variation of dark energy density, e.g., a
variation by factor ten in the dark energy density between z=0 and z=1 is
allowed at 95% confidence level. WMAP observations provide a better constraint
and the corresponding allowed variation is less than a factor of three.
Allowing for variation in w has an impact on the values for other cosmological
parameters in that the allowed range often becomes larger. (Abridged)

continuum normalized optical hydrogen and helium lines to determine
photospheric and wind parameters. We have assigned weights to these lines
accounting for line blends with species not taken into account, lacking

find the method to be robust, fast, and accurate. Using our method we analysed
seven O-type stars in the young cluster Cyg OB2 and five other Galactic stars

zeta Oph, and tau Sco) that have been studied in detail with a previous version

better than produced by the classical ``by eye'' method. We define errorbars on
the model parameters based on the maximum variations of these parameters in the
models that cluster around the global optimum. Using this concept, for the
investigated dataset we are able to recover mass-loss rates down to ~6d-8
Msun/yr to within an error of a factor of two. Comparison of our derived

pulsation causes a periodical variation of density and large-scale magnetic
field, this affecting the Alfv{\'e}n speed in the solar interior. Consequently
the Alfv{\'e}n waves with the half frequency of pulsation (i.e. with the double
period) can be parametrically amplified in the interior below the convection
zone due to the recently suggested swing wave-wave interaction. Therefore the
amplified Alfv{\'e}n waves have periods of several hours. The waves can
propagate upwards through the convection zone to the solar atmosphere and cause
the observed long-period Alfv{\'e}n oscillations in the solar wind.

respect to temperature: In the ZFC/ZFH process, weak SHG was observed at low
temperature, while in the FH/ZFC process, relatively high SHG appears in a
limited temperature range below TF depending on the field strength, and in the
FC and FH/FC processes, the SHG exhibits ferroelectric-like temperature

decreasing temperature and has a tendency of saturation. These experimental
results strongly suggest that dipole glass state or polar nano-clusters which
gradually freezes with decreasing temperature is transformed into
semi-macroscopic polar state under the electric field. However at sufficiently

enlarge the polar clusters. These experimental results show that the polar

is observed in relatively low magnetic fields. On the other hand, the magnetic
order in magnetically (Co2+) doped compounds survives at much higher magnetic

impurity-host magnetic interaction. The NMR measurements confirm the predicted
staggered nature of impurity-liberated spin degrees of freedom, which are
responsible for the magnetic ordering. In addition, differences in the

and all answer sets of disjunctive 2-programs in time O(m 1.4422..^n). Our main
results concern computing stable models of normal 3-programs, minimal models of
3-CNF theories and answer sets of disjunctive 3-programs. We design algorithms
that run in time O(m 1.6701..^n), in the case of the first problem, and in time
O(mn^2 2.2782..^n), in the case of the latter two. All these bounds improve by
exponential factors the best algorithms known previously. We also obtain
closely related upper bounds on the number of minimal models, stable models and
answer sets a t-CNF theory, a normal t-program or a disjunctive t-program may
have.

through a curved spacetime. This method involves two expansions to calculate
the self-force, one arising from the particle's immediate past and the other
from the more distant past. The expansion in the immediate past is a covariant
Taylor series and can be carried out for all geometries. The more distant
expansion is a mode sum, and may be carried out in those cases where the wave
equation for the field mediating the self-force admits a mode expansion of the
solution. In particular, this method can be used to calculate the gravitational
self-force for a particle of mass mu orbiting a black hole of mass M to order
mu^2, provided mu/M << 1. We discuss how to use these two expansions to
construct a full self-force, and in particular investigate criteria for
matching the two expansions. As with all methods of computing self-forces for
particles moving in black hole spacetimes, one encounters considerable
technical difficulty in applying this method; nevertheless, it appears that the
convergence of each series is good enough that a practical implementation may
be plausible.

to the Standard Model gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)_Y$ using a
single 144 of Higgs. The symmetry breaking occurs when the SU(5) 24-plet
component of 144 develops a vacuum expectation value. Further, it is possible
to obtain from the same 144 a light Higgs doublet necessary for electro-weak
symmetry breaking using recent ideas of string vacua landscapes and fine
tuning. Thus the breaking of SO(10) down to $SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}$ can be
accomplished with a single Higgs. We analyze this symmetry breaking pattern in
the nonsupersymmetric as well as in the supersymmetric SO(10) model.In this

that the resulting mass pattern is consistent with experimental data, including

description of non-overlapping nucleon (or baryon) bags bound by the
self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. This approach leads to
simple scaling relations for the changes of hadron masses in a nuclear medium.
It can also be extended to describe finite nuclei, as well as the properties of
hypernuclei and meson-nucleus deeply bound states. It is of great interest that
the model predicts a variation of the nucleon form factors in nuclear matter.
We also study the empirically observed, Bloom-Gilman (quark-hadron) duality.
  Other applications of the model include subthreshold kaon production in heavy
ion collisions, D and D-bar meson production in antiproton-nucleus collisions,
and J/Psi suppression. In particular, the modification of the D and D-bar meson
properties in nuclear medium can lead to a large J/Psi absorption cross
section, which explains the observed J/Psi suppression in relativistic heavy
ion collisions.

Neighbourhood effects interact with the initial distribution of educated agents
across space and play a key role in the long run stabilisation of the number of
educated individuals. Our model implies a tendency towards segregation, with a
possibly positive influence on growth, if team effects operate. The long run
growth rate is also shown to depend on the rate of time preference. Initial
circumstances are of vital importance for long run outcomes. A poor initial
education endowment will imply a long run reduced number of skilled workers and
a mediocre growth rate, so there no economic convergence tendency. On the

same time correlation tensors are equal. This statement allows us to transform
the results of an MSR quasi-Lagrangian statistical theory of hydrodynamic
turbulence back to the Eulerian representation. We define a hierarchy of
homogeneity symmetries between incremental homogeneity and global homogeneity.
It is shown that both the elimination of the sweeping interactions and the
derivation of the 4/5-law require a homogeneity assumption stronger than
incremental homogeneity but weaker than global homogeneity. The
quasi-Lagrangian transformation, on the other hand, requires an even stronger
homogeneity assumption which is many-time rather than one-time but still weaker
than many-time global homogeneity. We argue that it is possible to relax this
stronger assumption and still preserve the conclusions derived from theoretical
work based on the quasi-Lagrangian transformation.

two different approaches.
  First we work in the path integral formalism, showing how a truly bosonic
effective action can be derived from a generic fermionic one with a quartic
interaction. We then apply our scheme to the pairing hamiltonian in the
degenerate case proving that, in this instance, several of the features
characterizing the spontaneous breaking of the global gauge symmetry U(1)
occurring in the infinite system persist in the finite system as well.
  Accordingly we interpret the excitations associated with the addition and
removal of pairs of fermions as a quasi-Goldstone boson and the excitations
corresponding to the breaking of a pair (seniority one states in the language
of the pairing hamiltonian) as Higgs modes.
  Second, we face the more involved problem of a non-degenerate single particle
spectrum, where one more kind of excitations arises, corresponding to the
promotion of pairs to higher levels. This we do by solving directly the
Richardson equations. From this analysis the existence emerges of critical
values of the coupling constant, which signal the transition between two
regimes, one dominated by the mean field physics, the other by the pairing
interaction.

time-dependent risk aversion index, $\gamma_i(t)$, and we derive an approximate
formula for the demand function and aggregate price setting equation. The
dynamics of each agent's risk aversion index, $\gamma_i(t)$ (i=1,2,...,N), is
modeled by a bounded random walk with a constant variance $\delta^2$. We show

has emerged. In particular, no explicit, quantitative theory exists that
elucidates or distinguishes between the myriad hypotheses proposed for sleep.
Here, we develop a general, quantitative theory for mammalian sleep that
relates many of its fundamental parameters to metabolic rate and body size.
Most mechanisms suggested for the function of sleep can be placed in this
framework, e.g., cellular repair of damage caused by metabolic processes and
cortical reorganization to process sensory input. Our theory leads to
predictions for sleep time, sleep cycle time, and REM (rapid-eye-movement) time
as functions of body and brain mass, and explains, for example, why mice sleep
\~14 hours per day relative to the 3.5 hours per day that elephants sleep. Data
for 96 species of mammals, spanning six orders of magnitude in body size, are
consistent with these predictions and provide strong evidence that time scales
for sleep are set by the brain's, not the whole-body, metabolic rate.

qubits. We show that by treating transitions between each pair of levels
independently, intrinsic gate errors due primarily to population leakage to
undesired states can be estimated accurately from spectroscopic properties of
the qubits and minimized by choosing appropriate WPs. The validity and
efficiency of the approach are demonstrated by applying it to optimize the WPs
of two coupled rf SQUID flux qubits for controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation. The
result of this independent transition approximation (ITA) is in good agreement
with that of dynamic method (DM). Furthermore, the ratio of the speed of ITA to
that of DM scales exponentially as 2^n when the number of qubits n increases.

charge qubit due to it coupling with acoustic phonon baths. We individually
consider the acoustic piezoelectric as well as deformation coupling phonon
baths in the qubit environment. The decoherence times are calculated with two
kinds of methods. One of them is based on the qusiadiabatic propagator path
integral (QUAPI) and the other is based on Bloch equations, and two kinds of
results are compared. It is shown that the theoretical decoherence times of the
DQD charge qubit are shorter than the experimental reported results. It implies
that the phonon couplings to the qubit play a subordinate role, resulting in
the decoherence of the qubit.

relaxation or decoherence. Often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state
of a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a
definite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation. As
these preferred initial states are non-equilibrium states, they are not
stationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its
equilibrium, introducing error in computation. Since it is not possible to cut
off the relaxation processes completely, attempts are going on to develop
alternate strategies like Quantum Error Correction Codes or Noiseless
Subsystems. Here we study the relaxation behavior of various Pseudo Pure States
and analyze the role of Cross terms between different relaxation processes,
known as Cross-correlation. It is found that while cross-correlations
accelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states, they retard that of
others.

supplementary circuit or additional physical qubits to control the coupling nor
extra hardware to adjust the energy level structure. The feasibility of this

stabilization of mixed density operators to periodic orbits admits a natural
Lyapunov-based time-varying feedback design. A global description of the domain

set foliates as a complex flag manifold where each leaf is identified with the
coadjoint orbit of the eigenvalues of the density operator. The converging
conditions are time-independent but depend from the topology of the flag
manifold: it is shown that the closed loop must have a number of equilibria at

obstructions of topological nature to global stabilizability.
