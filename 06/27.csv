galaxies (SMGs) at z>~1. Although it is generally believed that these galaxies
host intense star-formation activity, there is growing evidence that a
substantial fraction also harbor an AGN. We present here possibly the strongest
evidence for this viewpoint to date: the combination of ultra-deep X-ray
observations (the 2 Ms CDF-N) and deep Keck spectroscopic data. We find that
the majority (~75%) of the spectroscopically identified SMGs host AGN activity;
the other ~25% have X-ray properties consistent with star formation (X-ray
derived SFRs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr). The AGNs have properties generally
consistent with those of nearby luminous AGNs (L_X~1E43-3E44) and the majority
(~80%) are heavily obscured. We construct composite rest-frame 2-20 keV spectra
for three different obscuration classes. An ~1 keV equivalent width FeK-alpha
emission line is seen in the composite X-ray spectrum of the most heavily
obscured AGNs (N_H>5x10^{23}), suggesting Compton-thick or near Compton-thick
absorption. Even taking into account the effects of absorption, we find that
the average X-ray-FIR ratio of the AGN-classified SMGs is approximately one
order of magnitude below that found for typical quasars. This result suggests
that intense star-formation activity dominates the bolometric output; however,
we also explore whether the X-ray-FIR ratio is intrinsically less than that
found for typical quasars and postulate that some SMGs may be AGN dominated. We
investigate the growth of massive black holes, discuss prospects for deeper
observations, and explore the potential of the next generation of X-ray
observatories. (ABRIDGED).

of a bar. Not only does the halo absorb angular momentum from the disk, it can
also be compressed and have its shape modified. We study these issues in a
series of cosmologically motivated, highly resolved N-body simulations of
barred galaxies run under different initial conditions. In all models we find
that the inner halo's central density increases. We model this density increase
using the standard adiabatic approximation and the modified formula by Gnedin
et al. and find that halo mass profiles are better reproduced by this latter.
In models with a strong bar, the dark matter in the central region forms a
bar-like structure (``dark matter bar''), which rotates together with the
normal bar formed by the stellar component (``stellar bar''). The
minor-to-major axial ratio of a halo bar changes with radius with a typical
value 0.7 in the central disk region. DM bar amplitude is mostly a function of
the stellar bar strength. Models in which the bar amplitude increases or stays
roughly constant with time, initially large (40%-60%) misalignment between the
halo and disk bars quickly decreases with time as the bar grows. The halo bar
is nearly aligned with the stellar bar (~10 degrees lag for the halo) after ~2
Gyr. The torque, which the halo bar exerts on the stellar bar, can serve as a
mechanism to regulate the angular momentum transfer from the disk to the halo.

associated with these shocks. In our model internal shocks result from
collisions of density inhomogeneities (shells) in relativistic jet flows. We
find that the merged shell resulting from the inelastic collision of shells has
a complicated internal structure due to the non-linear dynamics of the
interaction. Furthermore, the instantaneous efficiency for converting kinetic
energy into thermal energy is found to be almost twice as high as theoretically
expected during the period of significant emission. The Lorentz factors of the
internal shocks are correlated with the initial inertial masses of the shells.
  Because of the complexity of the non-linear evolution the merged shell
becomes very inhomogeneous and simple one-zone models are inadequate to extract
physical parameters of the emitting region from the resulting light curves. In
order to improve on these one-zone approximations, we propose a novel way of
analyzing the space-time properties of the emission. Based on these properties
we construct an analytic model of non-thermal flares which can be used to
constrain some (unobservable) physical parameters of the internal shocks. These
are the ratio of the Lorentz factors between the forward and the reverse shock
(caused by the shell collision), and the shell crossing times of these shocks.
The analytic model is validated by applying it to the synthetic light curves
computed from our models. It can equally well be applied to observations.

This has as a result that the morphology of inhomogeneous HII regions will be
drastically different, because shadowing effects have a less profound impact on
the apparent shape. Moreover, it will have influence on the propagation speed

f3 = 7.3696 c/d by means of a two dimensional frequency search across the Si
III 4567 A profiles. We identified the m-value of the main mode with frequency
f1 by taking into account the photometric identifications of the degrees l. By
means of the moment method and the amplitude and phase variations across the

mode identifications of the whole quintuplet for which three components were

conduction stabilizes the cloud by inhibiting the growth of K-H and R-T

compresses the cloud. This dynamical behaviour influences the observable
properties. We find that while OVI emission and absorption always arises in
cloud material at the periphery of the cloud, most of the soft X-ray arises in
the region between the wind bow shock and the cloud surface, and probes either
wind or cloud material depending on the strength of conduction and the relative
abundances of the wind with respect to the cloud. In general only a small
fraction (<1%) of the wind mechanical energy intersecting a cloud is radiated
away at UV and X-ray wavelengths, with more wind energy going into accelerating
the cloud. Models with heat conduction at Spitzer-levels are found to produce
observational properties closer to those observed in superwinds than models
with no thermal conduction, in particular in terms of the OVI-to-X-ray

In this paper, I calculate the absorption and scattering coefficients as a
function of frequency and grain size for acoustic waves in glacial ice and salt
domes and show that experimental measurements on laboratory samples and in
glacial ice and salt domes are consistent with theory. For South Pole ice with
grain size 0.2 cm at -51 degrees C, scattering lengths are calculated to be

W. Kohn in 1996 as the physical principal underlining Yang's electronic
structure alghoritm of divide and conquer. It describes the fact that, for
fixed chemical potential, local electronic properties at a point $r$, like the
density $n(r)$, depend significantly on the external potential $v$ only at
nearby points. Changes $\Delta v$ of that potential, {\it no matter how large},
beyond a distance $\textsf{R}$, have {\it limited} effects on local electronic
properties, which tend to zero as function of $\textsf{R}$. This remains true
even if the changes in the external potential completely surrounds the point
$r$. NEM can be quantitatively characterized by the nearsightedness range,
$\textsf{\textsf{R}}(r,\Delta n)$, defined as the smallest distance from $r$,
beyond which {\it any} change of the external potential produces a density
change, at $r$, smaller than a given $\Delta n$. The present paper gives a
detailed analysis of NEM for periodic metals and insulators in 1D and includes
sharp, explicit estimates of the nearsightedness range. Since NEM involves
arbitrary changes of the external potential, strong, even qualitative changes
can occur in the system, such as the discretization of energy bands or the
complete filling of the insulating gap of an insulator with continuum spectrum.
In spite of such drastic changes, we show that $\Delta v$ has only a limited
effect on the density, which can be quantified in terms of simple parameters of
the unperturbed system.

Hubbard model on the two-dimensional square lattice. Our purpose in this paper
is to evaluate the mass enhancement factor more quantitatively than the
conventional third order perturbation theory. We calculate it by expanding
perturbatively up to the fourth order with respect to the on-site repulsion
$U$. We consider the cases that the system is near the half-filling, which are
similar situations to high-$T_c$ cuprates. As results of the calculations, we
obtain the large mass enhancement on the Fermi surface by introducing the
fourth order terms. This is mainly originated from the fourth order
particle-hole and particle-particle diagrams. Although the other fourth order
terms have effect of reducing the effective mass, this effect does not cancel
out the former mass enhancement completely and there remains still a large mass
enhancement effect. In addition, we find that the mass enhancement factor
becomes large with increasing the on-site repulsion $U$ and the density of
state (DOS) at the Fermi energy $\rho(0)$. According to many current reseaches,
such large $U$ and $\rho(0)$ enhance the effective interaction between
quasiparticles, therefore the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$
increases. On the other hand, the large mass enhancement leads the reduction of
the energy scale of quasiparticles, as a result, $T_c$ is reduced. When we
discuss $T_c$, we have to estimate these two competitive effects.

  Recursive Loops","29 pages",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO",,"  Recursive loops in a logic program present a challenging problem to the PLP
framework. On the one hand, they loop forever so that the PLP backward-chaining
inferences would never stop. On the other hand, they generate cyclic
influences, which are disallowed in Bayesian networks. Therefore, in existing
PLP approaches logic programs with recursive loops are considered to be
problematic and thus are excluded. In this paper, we propose an approach that
makes use of recursive loops to build a stationary dynamic Bayesian network.
Our work stems from an observation that recursive loops in a logic program
imply a time sequence and thus can be used to model a stationary dynamic
Bayesian network without using explicit time parameters. We introduce a
Bayesian knowledge base with logic clauses of the form $A \leftarrow
A_1,...,A_l, true, Context, Types$, which naturally represents the knowledge
that the $A_i$s have direct influences on $A$ in the context $Context$ under
the type constraints $Types$. We then use the well-founded model of a logic
program to define the direct influence relation and apply SLG-resolution to
compute the space of random variables together with their parental connections.
We introduce a novel notion of influence clauses, based on which a declarative
semantics for a Bayesian knowledge base is established and algorithms for
building a two-slice dynamic Bayesian network from a logic program are
developed.

amongst a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable
allocation is to associate each task with a ``selfish agent'', and require each
agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of
agents to select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded
to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced.
  Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a
distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized
control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which
combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly
distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence
properties. For $m\gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\log\log m)$. We show using a
martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced
allocation in expected time $O(\log\log m+n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of
$\Omega(\max\{\log\log m,n\})$ for the convergence time.

the deformation is that the mode generation time is naturally determined by the

  We expand the non-local action in $H^2/\kappa^2$, with $H$ being the Hubble
parameter and $\kappa$ the deformation parameter, and then compute the power
spectra of scalar metric fluctuations both for the cases of exponential and
power law inflations up to the first order in $H^2/\kappa^2$. We show that the
power spectra of the metric fluctuation have non-trivial corrections on the
time dependence and on the momentum dependence compared to the commutative
space results. Especially for the power law inflation case, the power spectrum
for UV modes is weakly blue shifted early in the inflation and its strength
decreases in time. The power spectrum of far-IR modes has cutoff proportional

be chosen to be completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, to
preserve the invariance group of the theory and BRST symmetry. In the de Donder
gauge, however, the resulting boundary-value problem for the Laplace type
operator acting on h is known to be self-adjoint but not strongly elliptic. The
present paper shows that, on the Euclidean four-ball, only the scalar part of
perturbative modes for quantum gravity is affected by the lack of strong
ellipticity. Interestingly, three sectors of the scalar-perturbation problem
remain elliptic, while lack of strong ellipticity is confined to the remaining
fourth sector. The integral representation of the resulting zeta-function
asymptotics on the Euclidean four-ball is also obtained; this remains regular
at the origin by virtue of a peculiar spectral identity obtained by the
authors. There is therefore encouraging evidence in favour of the zeta(0) value
with fully diff-invariant boundary conditions remaining well defined, at least
on the four-ball, although severe technical obstructions remain in general.

alternatively characterized as those having a linear-fractional presentation

apply stochastic centre manifold theory to derive a one degree of freedom model

microscale structures induced by spatially varying stochastic noise within the
element. The crucial aspect of this work is that we explore how many noise
processes may interact in nonlinear dynamics. We see that noise processes with
coarse structure across a finite element are the significant noises for the
modelling. Further, the nonlinear dynamics abstracts effectively new noise

non-linear recursion relations on the geodesic distance. These are solved by
use of stationary multi-soliton tau-functions of suitable reductions of the KP

limit describing large graphs with marked points at large geodesic distances,
and obtain integrable differential equations for the corresponding scaling
functions. This provides a continuum formulation of two-dimensional quantum
gravity, in terms of the geodesic distance.

iterations in the model includes a noise generation term. We study the

(e.g. a random number generator) or a deterministic process (e.g. a chaotic
map). We compare the time series obtained from the above implementations of the
model by use of statistical methods (such as Detrended Fluctuation Analysis).
The conclusion is that using statistical methods the two versions of the model
are indistinguishable. The advantage of this observation is that we may
calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the model. As a result we obtain an
equation relating the DFA exponents (a statistical measure) with the Lyapunov
exponent for such models. On the other hand, typical statistical properties can
also be calculated, as for example the diffusion coefficient for a particle,
which movement is defined by the above model.

velocity depends primarily on the interaction, we obtain the following result:
If the model increases the required space of a person with increasing current
velocity, the reproduction of the typical form of the fundamental diagram is

Breaking. The system consists of two beads constrained to slide along a hoop
and attached each other through a spring. When the hoop rotates about a fixed
axis, the spring-beads system will change its equilibrium position as a
function of the angular velocity. The system shows two different regions of
symmetry separated by a critical point analogous to a second order transition.
The competitive balance between the rotational diynamics and the interaction of
the spring causes an Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking just as the balance between
temperature and the spin interaction causes a transition in a ferromagnetic
system. In addition, the gravitational potential act as an external force that
causes explicit symmetry breaking and a feature of first-order transition. Near
the transition point, the system exhibits a universal critical behavior where
the changes of the parameter of order is described by the critical exponent
beta =1/2 and the susceptibility by gamma =1. We also found a chaotic behavior
near the critical point. Through a demostrative device we perform some
qualitative observations that describe important features of the system.
