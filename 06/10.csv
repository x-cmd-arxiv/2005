The lens of event OGLE-2003-BLG-84 may be a Jupiter-mass free-floating planet
candidate based on a weak 3 sigma detection of finite-source effects. We find
that event MACHO-179-A is a brown dwarf candidate within ~100 pc of the Sun,
mostly due to its very small projected Einstein radius, \tilde r_E = 0.23+-0.05
AU. As expected, these microlensing parallax events are biased toward lenses
that are heavier and closer than average. These events were examined for
xallarap (or binary-source motion), which can mimic parallax. We find that 23%
of these events are strongly affected by xallarap.

that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may create a hoop-stress that
collimates jets. One argument is based upon consideration that
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, in general, and turbulence driven by the MRI,
in particular, is more nearly viscoelastic than it is viscous. Another argument
is based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D
simulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of
direct numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars and thick
accretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument
above and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I
also discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the
magnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads
to consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and
the radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself.
Additionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars
are not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an
MRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress
components. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the
gamma-ray burst GRB0212206. I argue that this polarization is consistent with a
tangled field, and does not require a large-scale organized field. Finally I
suggest that the role of magnetic fields in creating jets, as described here,
should be understood not to work within the confines of magnetocentrifugal
models of jets, but rather as an alternative to them.

field and cluster stars at such large distances show very similar abundance
patterns, and, in particular, all show enhancements of the ""alpha"" elements O,

Type II supernovae have been significant contributors to star formation in the

compare our results with those available for much younger objects. The limited
results for the H II regions and B stars in the outer disk also suggest that
the radial metallicity gradient in the outer disk is shallow or absent. The
much more extensive results for Cepheids confirm these trends, and that the
change in slope of the metallicity gradient may occur at a larger
Galactocentric distance than for the older stars and clusters. However, the
younger stars also show rising alpha element enhancements with increasing R_GC,
at least beyond 12 kpc. These trends are consistent with the idea of a
progressive growth in the size of the Galactic disk with time, and episodic
enrichment by Type II supernovae as part of the disk's growth. [Abridged]

line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies, sigma_V=1322^+74_-68 kms^-1,
which is significantly larger than what is expected in the case of a relaxed
cluster with an observed X-ray temperature of 5-6 keV. We find evidence that
this cluster is far from dynamical equilibrium, as shown by the non Gaussianity
of the velocity distribution, the presence of a velocity gradient and
significant substructure. Our analysis shows that the high value of sigma_V is
due to the complex structure of RX J0152-1357, i.e. to the presence of three
galaxy clumps of different mean velocity. Using optical data we detect a
low-velocity clump (with sigma_V=300-500 kms^-1) in the central SW region and a
high--velocity clump (with sigma_V sim 700 kms^-1) in the E region, well
corresponding to the SW and E peaks detected in the X-ray emission. The central
NE X-ray peak is associated to the main galaxy structure with a velocity which
is intermediate between those of the other two clumps and sigma_V sim 900
kms^-1. The mass of the whole system within 2 Mpc is estimated to lie in the
range (1.2-2.2)X10^{15} M_sun. Analytic calculations based on the two-body

density. This result is most simply interpreted as due to a weakening at low
metallicity of the mid-infrared emission bands usually attributed to PAHs

However, existing empirical spectral energy distribution models cannot account
for the observed short-wavelength (i.e., below 8 micron) colors of the

some other emission source (e.g., hot dust) is required.

has remained an open question. If all LMXBs formed within globular clusters,
the summed X-ray luminosity of the LMXBs in a galaxy should be directly
proportional to the number of globular clusters in the galaxy regardless of
where the LMXBs currently reside. We have compared these two quantities over
the same angular area for a sample of 12 elliptical and S0 galaxies observed

weaker than expected if all LMXBs formed within globular clusters. This
indicates that a significant number of the LMXBs were formed in the field, and
naturally accounts for the spread in field-to-cluster fractions of LMXBs from
galaxy to galaxy. We also find that the ""pollution"" of globular cluster LMXBs
into the field has been minimal within elliptical galaxies, but there is
evidence that roughly half of the LMXBs originally in the globular clusters of
S0 galaxies in our sample have escaped into the field. This is due to higher
globular cluster disruption rates in S0s resulting from stronger gravitational
shocks caused by the passage of globular clusters through the disks of S0
galaxies that are absent in elliptical galaxies.

leading to the formation of giant planets. While it has been heavily studied in
quiescent hydrodynamic disks, the effect of MHD turbulence arising from the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) has never been investigated. This paper
fills this gap and presents 3D numerical simulations of the evolution of
locally isothermal, massive and magnetized disks. In the absence of magnetic
fields, a laminar disk fragments and clumps are formed due to the effect of
self--gravity. Although they disapear in less than a dynamical timescale in the
simulations because of the limited numerical resolution, various diagnostics
suggest that they should survive and form giant planets in real disks. When the
disk is magnetized, it becomes turbulent at the same time as gravitational
instabilities develop. At intermediate resolution, no fragmentation is observed
in these turbulent models, while a large number of fragments appear in the
equivalent hydrodynamical runs. This is because MHD turbulence reduces the
strength of the gravitational instability. As the resolution is increased, the
most unstable wavelengths of the MRI are better resolved and small scale
angular momentum transport starts to play a role: fragments are found to form
in massive and turbulent disks in that case. All of these results indicate that
there is a complicated interaction between gravitational instabilities and MHD
turbulence that influences disk fragmentation processes.

stellar radii above the stellar surface has been taken as evidence that the
coronae of these stars must be very extended. The observed surface magnetic
fields, however, cannot contain X-ray emitting gas out to these distances. We
present an alternative model: that these prominences are trapped in long thin
loops embedded not in the X-ray corona, but in the wind. Above coronal helmet
streamers, oppositely-directed wind-bearing field lines reconnect to form
closed loops which then fill up with gas that was originally part of the wind.
We demonstrate that static equilibria exist for these loops at a range of
pressures and temperatures. The maximum loop height falls as the rotation rate
increases, but rises as the loop temperature decreases. For a solar-mass star
with rotation period 0.5 days, whose X-ray corona extends 1stellar radius above
the surface, loops at temperatures of 10, 000 K can extend out to 5 stellar
radii.

The Ha line consistently shows a double-peak profile varying from symmetric
shape to completely distorted on one side (V/R phases). A correlation between
the equivalent width of the Ha line and the infrared magnitudes is seen: as the
EW(Ha) decreases the IR magnitudes become fainter. This long-term optical/IR
variability is attributed to structural changes in the Be star's circumstellar
disc. The observations include a recent decline in the circumstellar disc and
subsequent recovery. We have witnessed the cessation of a global oscillation
due to the decline of the circumstellar disc. If the present disc growth rate
continues we predict the onset of another episode of V/R variability by the end
of 2006. We have investigated the typical time scales for disc variability of
various Be/X-ray binaries and found a correlation with the orbital period. This
correlation is hard to establish due to the difficulty in defining the exact
duration of the various activity states, but it is seen both in the duration of
the disc growth/dissipation phase and the value of the Ha equivalent width
prior to the appearance of asymmetric profiles. These relationships provide
further evidence for the interaction of the neutron star with the circumstellar
disc of the Be star's companion and confirms the need of a fully developed disc
for the V/R variability to be observed.

which the PDS/MECS cross-calibration constant is higher than the nominal value.
We attribute this mismatch to the presence of a serendipitous source in the PDS

indirect evidence (extrapolation to lower energies and/or comparison to
previous observations). This approach leads to the discovery of six new hard

belong to the Galactic halo, however a signficant number have disk kinematics
or belong to the bulge. Focusing on the [alpha/Fe] and light r-process element
ratios, we find that most globular cluster stars mimic those of the field stars
of similar metallicities, and neither clearly resembles the presently available
stellar abundances in the dwarf galaxies (including the globular clusters in
the Large Magellanic Cloud). The exceptions to these general elemental ratio
comparisons are already known in the literature, e.g., omega Centauri, Palomar
12, and Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius remnant, and Ruprecht 106
which has a high radial velocity and low [alpha/Fe] ratio. A few other globular
clusters show more marginal peculiarities. The most notable one being the halo
cluster M68 which has a high Galactocentric rotational velocity, a slightly
younger age, and a unique [Si/Ti] ratio. The [Si/Ti] ratios decrease with
increasing [Fe/H] at intermediate metallicities, which is consistent with very
massive stars playing a larger role in the early chemical evolution of the
Galaxy. The chemical similarities between globular clusters and field stars
with [Fe/H]<-1.0 suggests a shared chemical history in a well mixed early
Galaxy. The differences to the published chemistries of stars in the dwarf
spheroidal galaxies suggests that neither the globular clusters, halo stars,
nor thick disk stars had their origins in small isolated systems like the

and it is shown that at temperature of order or smaller than the interaction
energy the temperature reduction of the drag current is rather small. A
possible way of measuring the drag factor is proposed. A toroidal system with
the drag component confined in two half-ring wells separated by two Josephson
barriers is considered. Under certain condition such a system can be treated as
a Bose-Einstein counterpart of the Josephson charge qubit in an external
magnetic field. It is shown that the measurement of the difference of number of
atoms in two wells under a controlled evolution of the state of the qubit
allows to determine the drag factor.

aligned along the three principal directions with respect to the current:
longitudinal, transverse (in-plane), and polar (out-of-plane). At technical
saturation, the anisotropic MR (AMR) in polar fields turns out to be up to
twice as large as in transverse fields, which resembles the yet unexplained
geometrical size-effect (GSE), previously reported for Ni- and Permalloy films.
Upon increasing temperature, the polar and transverse AMR's are reduced by
phonon-mediated sd-scattering, but their ratio, i.e. the GSE remains unchanged.
Basing on Potters's theory [Phys.Rev.B 10, 4626(1974)], we associate the GSE
with an anisotropic effect of the spin-orbit interaction on the sd-scattering
of the minority spins due to a film texture. Below magnetic saturation, the
magnitudes and signs of all three MR's depend significantly on the domain
structures depicted by magnetic force microscopy. Based on hysteresis loops and
taking into account the GSE within an effective medium approach, the three MR's
are explained by the different magnetization processes in the domain states.
These reveal the importance of in-plane uniaxial anisotropy and out-of-plane
texture for the thinnest and thickest films, respectively.

prescription for general operators to give finite coefficients in this limit.
We explain how this is related to the fact that the leads play the role of
thermal baths and allow relaxation to occur and the steady state to form. This
proves perturbatively that a steady state is reached in the Schwinger-Keldysh
formulation, and specifies which operators correspond to quantities that have a
well-defined value in the steady state. Then, we show that the steady state can
be described by a special type of density matrix (related to Hershfield's
conjecture for the particular example of the non-equilibrium Kondo model.) In
the second part of the paper we perform a renormalization-group analysis of the
perturbative series. We give a general argument that strongly suggests that the
perturbative series of any average in the steady state satisfies the
equilibrium Callan-Symanzik equations, and show in detail how it works to
one-loop order for the electric current operator inside any average. We finally
compute to two loops order the average of the electric current in the steady
state, and perform a renormalization-group improvement. From this, we give a
universal prescription, valid in the perturbative regime, for comparing the
effect of the electric current to that of the temperature on the ``Kondo

challenge due to tightly coupled, non-linear subsystems of different technical
domains. Furthermore, a simulation regarding performance, efficiency, and
operability cannot be limited to the machine itself, but has to include
operator, environment, and work task. This paper presents some results of our
approach to an event-driven simulation model of a human operator. Describing
the task and the operator model independently of the machine's technical
parameters, gives the possibility to change whole sub-system characteristics
without compromising the relevance and validity of the simulation.

need to share, access, transport, process and manage large data collections
distributed worldwide. They combine high-end computing technologies with
high-performance networking and wide-area storage management techniques. In
this paper, we discuss the key concepts behind Data Grids and compare them with
other data sharing and distribution paradigms such as content delivery
networks, peer-to-peer networks and distributed databases. We then provide
comprehensive taxonomies that cover various aspects of architecture, data
transportation, data replication and resource allocation and scheduling.
Finally, we map the proposed taxonomy to various Data Grid systems not only to
validate the taxonomy but also to identify areas for future exploration.
Through this taxonomy, we aim to categorise existing systems to better
understand their goals and their methodology. This would help evaluate their
applicability for solving similar problems. This taxonomy also provides a ""gap
analysis"" of this area through which researchers can potentially identify new
issues for investigation. Finally, we hope that the proposed taxonomy and
mapping also helps to provide an easy way for new practitioners to understand
this complex area of research.

most striking feature of the experimental data - an absence of absorption of
high transverse momentum pions in the reaction plane direction for
mid-peripheral collisions - points to the presence of a surface zone with no
absorption and strong suppression in the inner core. A natural interpretation
of such a zone could be the plasma formation time T~2-3 fm/c. The existence of
a formation time could dramatically change our understanding of many
experimentally observed features. With this assumption we describe the angular
anisotropy of high transverse momentum pions with respect to the reaction plane

close to the gap, the gapless modes have a quadratic energy dispersion relation
at low energy and open a secondary gap at the Fermi surface, which is only
power-suppressed by the coupling. On the other hand, for a large mismatch, we
find the gapless superconductor does not open a secondary gap, but instead
makes transition to a new phase by forming the condensate of supercurrents. We
calculate the condensate of supercurrents by minimizing the effective
potential. In the new phase, the Meissner mass is positive for the magnetic
fields orthogonal to the direction of the condensate but zero in the parallel
direction.

are also investigated. By giving a large list of possible neutrino mass

primary field \phi_{2,1} of dimension $(p-2)/4$. Within this framework, we
provide a quasi-particle description of these models, in which all states are
expressed solely in terms of the \phi_{2,1}-modes. More precisely, we show that
all the states can be written in terms of \phi_{2,1}-type highest-weight states
and their phi_{2,1}-descendants. We further demonstrate that the conformal
dimension of these highest-weight states can be calculated from the \phi_{2,1}
commutation relations, the highest-weight conditions and associativity. For the
simplest models (p=5,7), the full spectrum is explicitly reconstructed along
these lines. For $p$ odd, the commutation relations between the \phi_{2,1}
modes take the form of infinite sums, i.e., of generalized commutation
relations akin to parafermionic models. In that case, an unexpected operator,
generalizing the Witten index, is unravelled in the OPE of \phi_{2,1} with
itself. A quasi-particle basis formulated in terms of the sole \phi_{1,2} modes
is studied for all allowed values of p. We argue that it is governed by
jagged-type partitions further subject a difference 2 condition at distance 2.
We demonstrate the correctness of this basis by constructing its generating
function, from which the proper fermionic expression of the combination of the
Virasoro irreducible characters \chi_{1,s} and \chi_{1,p-s} (for 1\leq s\leq
[p/3]+1) are recovered. As an aside, a practical technique for implementing
associativity at the level of mode computations is presented, together with a

computations of the potential did not include the dilaton and the critical
point formed by the quadratic and cubic interactions was destroyed by the
quartic tachyon term. We include the dilaton contributions to the potential and
find that a critical point survives and appears to become more shallow. We are
led to consider the existence of a closed string tachyon vacuum, a critical
point with zero action that represents a state where space-time ceases to be
dynamical. Some evidence for this interpretation is found from the study of the
coupled metric-dilaton-tachyon effective field equations, which exhibit rolling
solutions in which the dilaton runs to strong coupling and the Einstein metric
undergoes collapse.

Lie algebroids to both physicists and noncommutative geometers. Groupoids
generalize groups, spaces, group actions, and equivalence relations. This last
aspect dominates in noncommutative geometry, where groupoids provide the basic
tool to desingularize pathological quotient spaces. In physics, however, the
main role of groupoids is to provide a unified description of internal and
external symmetries. What is shared by noncommutative geometry and physics is
the importance of Connes's idea of associating a C*-algebra C*(G) to a Lie
groupoid G: in noncommutative geometry C*(G) replaces a given singular quotient
space by an appropriate noncommutative space, whereas in physics it gives the
algebra of observables of a quantum system whose symmetries are encoded by G.
Moreover, Connes's map G -> C*(G) has a classical analogue G -> A*(G) in
symplectic geometry due to Weinstein, which defines the Poisson manifold of the
corresponding classical system as the dual of the so-called Lie algebroid A(G)
of the Lie groupoid G, an object generalizing both Lie algebras and tangent
bundles. This will also lead into symplectic groupoids and the conjectural
functoriality of quantization.

\emph{reducible} if there exists an essential curve system $\C$ in $D_n$,
called a \emph{reduction system} of $\alpha$, such that $\alpha*\C=\C$ where
$\alpha*\C$ denotes the action of the braid $\alpha$ on the curve system $\C$.
A curve system $\C$ in $D_n$ is said to be \emph{standard} if each of its
components is isotopic to a round circle centered at the real axis.
  In this paper, we study the characteristics of the braids sending a curve
system to a standard curve system, and then the characteristics of the
conjugacy classes of reducible braids. For an essential curve system $\C$ in
$D_n$, we define the \emph{standardizer} of $\C$ as $\St(\C)=\{P\in
B_n^+:P*\C{is standard}\}$ and show that $\St(\C)$ is a sublattice of $B_n^+$.
In particular, there exists a unique minimal element in $\St(\C)$. Exploiting
the minimal elements of standardizers together with canonical reduction systems
of reducible braids, we define the outermost component of reducible braids, and
then show that, for the reducible braids whose outermost component is simpler
than the whole braid (including split braids), each element of its ultra summit
set has a standard reduction system. This implies that, for such braids,
finding a reduction system is as easy as finding a single element of the ultra
summit set.

importance to the philosophy of physics, and any interpretation of quantum
mechanics has to clarify it. Our discussion of this relationship is partly
historical and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically rigorous,
including over 500 references. On the assumption that quantum mechanics is
universal and complete, we discuss three ways in which classical physics has so
far been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely in the limit h -> 0 of
small Planck's constant (in a finite system), in the limit of a large system,
and through decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit is closely
related to modern quantization theory and microlocal analysis, whereas the
second involves methods of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection
sectors and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical world does
not emerge as a sharply defined objective reality, but rather as an approximate
appearance relative to certain ""classical"" states and observables. Decoherence
subsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that they are ""einselected"",
i.e. robust against coupling to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of
classical observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically define
(approximately) consistent sets of histories. We make the point that
classicality results from the elimination of certain states and observables
from quantum theory. Thus the classical world is not created by observation (as
Heisenberg once claimed), but rather by the lack of it.

wavefunctions in space is the violation of the principle of energy
conservation. In the models proposed in the literature the stochastic field
which is responsible for the localization mechanism causes the momentum to
behave like a Brownian motion, whose larger and larger fluctuations show up as
a steady increase of the energy of the system. In spite of the fact that, in
all situations, such an increase is small and practically undetectable, it is
an undesirable feature that the energy of physical systems is not conserved but
increases constantly in time, diverging for $t \to \infty$. In this paper we
show that this property of collapse models can be modified: we propose a model
of spontaneous wavefunction collapse sharing all most important features of
usual models but such that the energy of isolated systems reaches an asymptotic
finite value instead of increasing with a steady rate.

non-demolition measurement in an ensemble of cold 87Rb atoms. By considering
the interaction of atoms in the 5S_{1/2}(F=1) ground state with probe light
tuned near the D2 transition, we show that, for large detunings, this system is
equivalent to a spin-1/2 system when suitable Zeeman substates and quantum
operators are used to define a pseudo-spin. The degree of squeezing is derived
for the rubidium system in the presence of scattering causing decoherence and
loss. We describe how the system can decohere and lose atoms, and predict as
much as 75% spin squeezing for atomic densities typical of optical dipole
traps.
