massive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using a
numerical code ZEUS-2D. Changing field configurations and laws of differential
rotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of these
parameters on the dynamics. In our models, we do not solve the neutrino
transport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric EOS that takes into
account the neutrino emissions. As a result of the calculations, we find that
the field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core if
the initial magnetic field is large enough. Models with initially concentrated
fields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than the
uniform field. Quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fast
jet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(GRB). The Lorentz forces
exerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsible
for these dynamics. The pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not lead
to any explosion or matter ejection. This suggests the presupernova models of
Heger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, is
disadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.
Models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matter
ejection, either. In these models magnetic fields play no role as they do not
grow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressure
could be comparable to the matter pressure. This is because the exponential
field growth as expected in MRI is not seen in our models. The magnetic field
is amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.

distribution of a sample of isolated spiral galaxies in order to model their

determine the necessity of a dark halo in the inner parts (Perez et al. 2004).
The azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles and the integrated
magnitudes obtained from ellipse fitting are given for each of the sample
galaxies. The ellipse fitting technique applied to the light distribution also
allowed us to obtain the size of the bar, and the inclination and position
angle of the outer isophotes that allow the galaxy deprojection. Using these
profiles, 1-D disk-bulge decomposition was performed to obtain the disk
scale-length and the bulge effective radius for the different bands. Through
the fitting of a parametric function to the observed rotation curve, the
maximum rotational velocity and the corresponding radius was obtained. The
correlation between the bulge and disk parameters is in agreement with previous
studies (de Jong 1996a; Marquez & Moles 1999; Baggett et al. 1998). Regarding
the Kormendy relation (Kormendy 1977), in agreement with de Jong, no
correlation between the bulge effective radius and its surface brightness is
found, possibly due to the small range of bulge magnitudes covered. We find a
smaller scatter in the structural relations when compared to non-isolated
samples in agreement with Marquez & Moles (1999). Finally, a correlation
between the disk scale-length and the bar size is observed, possibly reflecting
the rapid growth of a bar.

an axisymmetric wind with the masers tracing bow shocks formed as the wind

interesting because they could be low-mass runaway stars recently accelerated
by n-body interactions in compact multiple systems. Of particular interest
among these stars is JW 451, which has a P = 0.98, the largest transverse

proper motion vector which suggests that it was accelerated by the component C

considered part of the cluster, because these objects are also externally

distribution of a standard Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) disk for typical

tends to be closer to the disk surface towards the inner disk regions. Our main
conclusion, however, is that a line-driven wind, arising from a steady disk
flux distribution of a standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk capable of locally
supplying the corresponding mass flow, is steady. These results confirm the
findings of an earlier paper that studied ""simple"" flux distributions that are
more readily analyzable than those presented here. These results are consistent
with the steady velocity nature of outflows observationally inferred for both
CVs and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). We find good agreement with the 2.5D CV
disk wind models of Pereyra and collaborators. These results suggest that the
likely scenario to account for the wind outflows commonly observed in CVs is
the line-driven accretion disk wind scenario, as suggested early-on by Cordova
& Mason (1982). For QSOs, these results show that the line-driven accretion
disk wind continues to be a promising scenario to account for the outflows
detected in broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs, as suggested early-on by Turnshek

model where the accretion rate has changed from one epoch to the next (without
considering additional continuum emission components). The fit to the composite
residual has two free parameters: a normalizing constant and the average
characteristic temperature $\bar{T}^*$. In turn the characteristic temperature
is dependent on the ratio of the mass accretion rate to the square of the black
hole mass. We therefore conclude that most of the UV/optical variability may be
due to processes involving the disk, and thus that a significant fraction of
the UV/optical spectrum may come directly from the disk.

the existence of two independent spots or groups in the photosphere of LO Peg,

of mass ratios, impact parameters and orbital energies are studied. Both merger

compared to real-life elliptical galaxies. The properties of merger remnants
show a large variety. Merger remnants resulting from head-on encounters are
mainly non-rotating prolate spheroids. Merger remnants from models with angular
momentum different from zero are triaxial or mildly oblate spheroids supported
in part by rotation. The velocity distributions are biased towards the radial
direction in the prolate case and the tangential direction in the oblate case.
Non-mergers are affected in various ways, depending on the orbital
characteristics. We conclude that many of the global properties of real-life
ellipticals can in principle be attributed to a merger of spherical
progenitors.

reexamined in the inviscid limit where the length scales of horizontal
disturbances are large compared their vertical and radial counterparts.
Boundary conditions different than channel walls are also considered. This
quasi-hydrostatic, semi-geostrophic (QHSG) approximation allows one to examine
the effect of a vertically varying Brunt-Vaisaila frequency, $N^2$. It is found
that the normal-mode instability persists when $N^2$ increases quadratically
with respect to the disc vertical coordinate. However we also find that the SRI
seems to exist in this inviscid QHSG extreme only for channel wall conditions:
when one or both of the reflecting walls are removed there is no instability in
the asymptotic limit explored here. It is also found that only exponential-type
SRI modes (as defined by Dubrulle et al. 2005) exist under these conditions.
These equations also admit non-normal mode behaviour. Fixed Lagrangian pressure
conditions on both radial boundaries predicts there to be no normal mode
behaviour in the QHSG limit. The mathematical relationship between the results
obtained here and that of the classic Eady (1949) problem for baroclinic
instability is drawn. We conjecture as to the mathematical/physical nature of
the SRI.
  The general linear problem, analyzed without approximation in the context of
the Boussinesq equations, admits a potential vorticity-like quantity that is
advectively conserved by the shear. Its existence means that a continuous
spectrum \emph{is a generic feature of this system}. It also implies that in
places where the Brunt-Vaisaila frequency becomes dominant the linearized flow
may two-dimensionalize by advectively conserving its vertical vorticity.

survey of 261 white dwarfs was capable of directly detecting companions at
orbital separations between $\sim100$ and 5000 AU with masses as low as 0.05
$M_{\odot}$, while a deep near field search of 86 white dwarfs was capable of
directly detecting companions at separations between $\sim50$ and 1100 AU with
masses as low as 0.02 $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, all white dwarf targets were
examined for near-infrared excess emission, a technique capable of detecting
companions at arbitrarily close separations down to masses of 0.05 $M_{\odot}$.
  No brown dwarf candidates were detected, which implies a brown dwarf
companion fraction of $<0.5$% for white dwarfs. In contrast, the stellar
companion fraction of white dwarfs as measured by this survey is 22%,
uncorrected for bias. Moreover, most of the known and suspected stellar
companions to white dwarfs are low mass stars whose masses are only slightly
greater than the masses of brown dwarfs. Twenty previously unknown stellar
companions were detected, five of which are confirmed or likely white dwarfs
themselves, while fifteen are confirmed or likely low mass stars.
  Similar to the distribution of cool field dwarfs as a function of spectral
type, the number of cool unevolved dwarf companions peaks at mid-M type. Based
on the present work, relative to this peak, field L dwarfs appear to be roughly
2-3 times more abundant than companion L dwarfs. Additionally, there is no
evidence that the initial companion masses have been altered by post main

galaxy NGC 3379 resolves 75% of the X-ray emission within the central 5kpc into
point sources. Spectral analysis of the remaining unresolved emission within
the central 770pc indicates that 90% of the emission probably arises from
undetected point sources, while 10% arises from thermal emission from kT=0.6keV
gas. Assuming a uniform density distribution in the central region of the
galaxy gives a gas mass of 5.0e5 Mo.Such a small amount of gas can be supplied
by stellar mass loss in only 1.0e7 years. Thus, the gas must be accreting into
the central supermassive black hole at a very low radiative efficiency as in
the ADAF or RIAF models, or is being expelled in a galactic wind driven by the
same AGN feedback mechanism as that observed in cluster cooling flows. If the
gas is being expelled in an AGN driven wind, then the ratio of mechanical to
radio power of the AGN must be 1.0e4, which is comparable to that measured in
cluster cooling flows which have recently been perturbed by radio outbursts.
The brightest point source in NGC 3379 is located 360pc from the central AGN
with a peak luminosity of 3.5e39 ergs/s, which places it in the class of
ultra-luminous X-ray point sources (ULX). Analysis of an archival ROSAT HRI
observation of NGC 3379 shows that this source was at a comparable luminosity 5
years prior to the Chandra observation. During the Chandra observation, the
source intensity smoothly varies by a factor of two with the suggestion of an
8-10 hour period.

and luminosity (by a factor of ~10-20). This result fits in the picture we
suggested earlier, namely that the f> 1 Hz variability in luminous LMXBs is
primarily due to variations of the boundary layer luminosity. In this picture
the frequency resolved spectrum equals the boundary layer spectrum, which
therefore can be straightforwardly determnined from the data. The obtained so
boundary layer spectrum is well approximated by the saturated Comptonization
model, its high energy cut-off follows kT~2.4 keV black body. Its independence
on the global mass accretion rate lends support to the theoretical suggestion
by Inogamov &Sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressure
supported. With this assumption we constrain the gravity on the neutron star
surface and its mass and radius. Equipped with the knowledge of the boundary
layer spectrum we attempt to relate the motion along the Z-track to changes of
physically meaningful parameters. Our results suggest that the contribution of
the boundary layer to the observed emission decreases along the Z-track from
conventional ~50% on the horizontal branch to a rather small number on the
normal branch. This decrease can be caused, for example, by obscuration of the
boundary layer by the geometrically thick accretion disk at Mdot ~ Mdot_Edd.
Alternatively, this can indicate significant change of the structure of the
accretion flow at Mdot ~ Mdot_ Edd and disappearance of the boundary layer as a
distinct region of the significant energy release associated with the neutron
star surface.

that while the gapless semi-acoustic plasmon cannot account for the observed
spectra as claimed by other investigators, the low-lying optical plasmon
corresponding to the tangential motion of the electrons on the nanotube surface
can explain the observed features. In particular, this theory can explain
occurrence of both the Lorentzian and BWF lineshapes in the G-band Raman
spectra of metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, the theory shows
that the BWF peak moves to higher frequency, has a lower intensity and a lower
half width at higher diameters of the nanotube. All these features are in
agreement with experimental observations.

decoherence by coupling to external charges. The resulting current I through
the device depends on the ratio of the decoherence rate Gamma_phi and the
tunneling rates. For Gamma_phi --> 0 one has simply I=e Gamma_phi. With
increasing Gamma_phi the current peaks at the inverse trapping time. The direct

obtained via a Chapman-Enskog-like expansion around a local shear flow

deviations of the hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the
reference state. The corresponding transport coefficients are determined from a
set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by
using a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation. The main new ingredient in
this expansion is that the reference state $f^{(0)}$ (zeroth-order

addition, since the collisional cooling cannot be compensated locally for
viscous heating, the distribution $f^{(0)}$ depends on time through its
dependence on temperature. This means that in general, for a given degree of
inelasticity, the complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients
on the shear rate requires the analysis of the {\em unsteady} hydrodynamic
behavior. To simplify the analysis, the steady state conditions have been
considered here in order to perform a linear stability analysis of the

stationary and non-stationary solutions; the latter allows dynamical order,
characterized by multiple degrees of clustering, for both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic interactions. We present a detailed stability analysis of
these solutions: In a ferromagnetic system, the canonical distribution is
observed stable down to a certain temperature, which tends to get lower as the
number of Fourier components of the perturbed distribution is increased in the
analysis. The non-stationary solution remains neutrally stable below the
critical temperature, indicating inequivalence between the two ensembles. For
antiferromagnetic systems, all solutions are found to be neutrally stable at

resistance in island metal films is of considerable interest from both academic
as well as applications point of view. Aging is attributed to various causes,
oxidation of islands and mobility of islands followed by coalescence (mobility
coalescence) being the main contenders. The effect of parameters like substrate
temperature, substrate cleaning, residual gases in the vacuum chamber,
ultrasonic vibration of the substrate, suggest that the mobility coalescence is
responsible for the aging in island metal films. Electron microscopy studies
show evidence for mobility of islands at high substrate temperatures. The
comparison of aging data of island silver films deposited on glass substrates
in ultra high vacuum and high vacuum suggests that the oxidation of islands, as
being responsible for aging in these films, can be ruled out. Further, under
certain conditions of deposition, island silver films exhibit a dramatic and
drastic fall in electrical resistance, marking the insulator-metal transition.
This interesting transition observed in a conservative system - after the
stoppage of deposition of the film- is a clear evidence for mobility
coalescence of islands even at room temperature. The sudden fall in resistance
is preceded by fluctuations in resistance with time and fluctuations are
attributed to the making and breaking of the percolation path in the film.

which move randomly on a simple cubic lattice, constrained by hard-core
exclusion, and may spontaneously annihilate and re-appear at some prescribed
rates. We determine analytically the density profiles of the ""environment""

terminal velocity as the function of the applied field and other system

exerted on the carrier by the ""environment"" particles shows a viscous-like

percolative environments. The corresponding friction coefficient is also

nodes (typically off-the-shelf single or dual processor machines) connected
together with a high speed interconnect. Using cluster computation has many
benefits, but also carries the liability of being failure prone due to the
sheer number of components involved. Many effective solutions have been
proposed to aid failure recovery in clusters, their one significant downside
being the failure models they support. Most of the work in the area has focused
on detecting and correcting fail-stop errors. We propose a system that will
also detect more general error models, such as Byzantine errors, thus allowing
existing failure recovery methods to handle them correctly.

whenever a peer enters the system, it establishes an acquaintance with a small

administrator provides correspondences between the local schema and the
acquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of arrows and

between the schemas from these visual annotations. We pin down a semantics of
query translation given such mapping rules, and present a novel query
translation algorithm for a simple but expressive fragment of XQuery, that
employs the mapping rules in either direction. We show the translation

by this application, we use first-order perturbation theory to study tidal
coupling for an idealized case: a massive Schwarzschild black hole, tidally
perturbed by a much less massive moon in a distant, circular orbit. We
investigate the details of how the tidal deformation of the hole gives rise to
an induced quadrupole moment in the hole's external gravitational field at
large radii. In the limit that the moon is static, we find, in Schwarzschild
coordinates and Regge-Wheeler gauge, the surprising result that there is no
induced quadrupole moment. We show that this conclusion is gauge dependent and
that the static, induced quadrupole moment for a black hole is inherently
ambiguous. For the orbiting moon and the central Schwarzschild hole, we find
(in agreement with a recent result of Poisson) a time-varying induced
quadrupole moment that is proportional to the time derivative of the moon's
tidal field. As a partial analog of a result derived long ago by Hartle for a
spinning hole and a stationary distant companion, we show that the orbiting
moon's tidal field induces a tidal bulge on the hole's horizon, and that the
rate of change of the horizon shape leads the perturbing tidal field at the
horizon by a small angle.

radius. The first model considered, in the absence of a thin shell, is that of
an asymptotically flat phantom wormhole spacetime. The second model constructed
is that of an isotropic pressure phantom wormhole, which is of particular
interest, as the notion of phantom energy is that of a spatially homogeneous
cosmic fluid, although it may be extended to inhomogeneous spherically

directly via gravitational waves, and the self-force problem becomes one of
urgent and highly-motivated problems in general relativity. Roughly speaking,
there are two approaches to investigate this problem; the so-called
post-Newtonian approximation, and a black hole perturbation.
  In this paper, we review a theoretical progress in the self-force problem
using a black hole perturbation. Although the self-force problem seems to be
just a problem to calculate a self-force, we discuss that the real problem is
to define a gauge invariant concept of a motion in a gauge dependent metric

gravitational wave detection by LISA, this may still be insufficient. We
further consider a gauge transformation in this new metric perturbation scheme,

detection by LISA.

it is also static. Since recent astrophysical motivations point in the

function in the chiral limit. This is done with the help of a model with an
expansion in inverse powers of the number of colors, Nc, allowing us to
consider resonances with a finite width. Due to these duality violations, the
Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and the moments of the spectral function (e.g.
the Weinberg sum rules) do not match at finite momentum, and we analyze this
difference in detail. We also perform a comparative study of many of the
different methods proposed in the literature for the extraction of the OPE
parameters and find that, when applied to our model, they all fare quite
similarly. In fact, the model strongly suggests that a significant improvement
in precision can only be expected after duality violations are included. To
this end, we propose a method to parameterize these duality violations. The
method works quite well for the model, and we hope that it may also be useful
in future determinations of OPE parameters in QCD.

that radiation of photons is possible only when the sign of the particle
helicity is opposite to that of the effective potential describing the

radiative self-polarization the radiating particle can change its helicity. As
a result, the active left-handed polarized neutrino (right-handed polarized
antineutrino) converting to the state with inverse helicity can become
practically ``sterile''. Since the sign of the effective potential depends on
the neutrino flavor and the matter structure, the spin light can change a ratio
of active neutrinos of different flavors. In the ultra relativistic approach,
the radiated photons averaged energy is equal to one third of the initial

an in depth discussion of the conjecture presented in Combescure of the case

defined. The invariant $F^n$ takes values in $PM_{2\times2^n}(\mathbb Z)$, that
is the set of $2\times 2^n$ matrices over $\mathbb Z$ modulo the scalar
multiplication of $\pm1$. This invariant leads to a generalization of a theorem
of D. Krebes which gives a necessary condition for a given collection of
tangles to be embedded in a link in $S^3$ disjointly. Furthermore, we provide
the general formula to compute the invariant of the $k_1 + ... + k_n$-punctured

Also, we consider various connect sums among punctured ball tangles and provide

Thus, $F^n$ is not surjective when $n=1$. In addition, we introduce monoid

tangles and show that the group generated by the elementary operations on

of the ``vacuum field.'' Physical variables (e.g., energy) are given by maps
$f: \Omega \to {\bf R}$ (functions of classical fields). The crucial point is
that statistical states and variables are symplectically invariant. The
conventional quantum representation of our prequantum classical statistical
model is constructed on the basis of the Teylor expansion (up to the terms of
the second order at the vacuum field point $\omega=0)$ of variables $f: \Omega
\to {\bf R}$ with respect to the small parameter $\kappa= \sqrt{h}.$ A Gaussian
symplectically invariant measure (statistical state) is represented by its
covariation operator (von Neumann statistical operator). A symplectically
invariant smooth function (variable) is represented by its second derivative at
the vacuum field point $\omega=0.$ From the statistical viewpoint QM is a
statistical approximation of the prequantum classical statistical field theory
(PCSFT). Such an approximation is obtained through neglecting by statistical
fluctuations of the magnitude $o(h), h\to 0,$ in averages of physical
variables. Equations of Schr\""odinger, Heisenberg and von Neumann are images of

distinction between microscopic and macroscopic things, and they are ambiguous

difficulties. In this paper we look at a wide range of representative

schemes in cryptography with the difference that the committing party, say

party say Bob. Similar to bit commitment schemes, such schemes are supposed to
be binding, i.e Alice cannot change her choice after committing, and concealing
i.e. Bob cannot find Alice's committed string before Alice reveals it.
  Ideal commitment schemes are known to be impossible. Even if some degrees of
cheating is allowed, Buhrman, Christandl, Hayden, Lo and Wehner
(quant-ph/0504078) have recently shown that there are some binding-concealing
trade-offs that any quantum string commitment scheme (QSC) must follow. They
showed trade-offs both in the scenario of single execution of the protocol and
in the asymptotic regime of sufficiently large number of parallel executions of

  We present here new trade-offs in the scenario of single execution of a QSC

Thin films are described with spatially dispersive (nonlocal) dielectric
functions. For thin films the nonlocal effects are more relevant than for
half-spaces. However, it is shown that even for film thickness smaller than the
mean free path for electrons, the difference between local and nonlocal
calculations of the Casimir force is of the order of a few tenths of a percent.
Thus the local description of thin metallic films is adequate within the
current experimental precision and range of separations.

classical ensemble Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Schrodingers equation. Crucial
roles are played by the assumptions of universality and simplicity (Occam's
Razor) which restrict the number and type of of arbitrary constants that appear
in the equations of motion. In this approach, non-relativistic quantum theory
is seen as the unique single parameter extension of the classical ensemble
dynamics. The method is contrasted with other related constructions in the
literature and some consequences of relaxing the axioms are also discussed: for
example, the appearance of nonlinear higher-derivative corrections possibly
related to gravity and spacetime fluctuations. Finally, some open research
problems within this approach are highlighted.

network into the natural gates (pulses and delays) for an Ising quantum
computer. The aim is not necessarily to generate the most efficient pulse
sequence, but rather to develop an efficient compilation algorithm that can be
easily implemented in large spin systems. The key observation is that it is not
always necessary to refocus all the undesired couplings in a spin system.
Instead the coupling evolution can simply be tracked and then corrected at some
later time. Although described within the language of NMR the algorithm is
applicable to any design of quantum computer based on Ising couplings.

corresponding generalized eigenvectors may be interpreted as resonant states
which are responsible for the irreversible quantum dynamics of a damped
harmonic oscillator.

  approach","19 pages, 1 figure",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.74.033808",,"quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  In this theoretical paper, we investigate coherence properties of the
near-resonant light scattered by two atoms exposed to a strong monochromatic
field. To properly incorporate saturation effects, we use a quantum Langevin
approach. In contrast to the standard optical Bloch equations, this method
naturally provides the inelastic spectrum of the radiated light induced by the
quantum electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. However, to get the right spectral
properties of the scattered light, it is essential to correctly describe the
statistical properties of these vacuum fluctuations. Because of the presence of
the two atoms, these statistical properties are not Gaussian : (i) the spatial
two-points correlation function displays a speckle-like behavior and (ii) the
three-points correlation function does not vanish. We also explain how to
incorporate in a simple way propagation with a frequency-dependent scattering
mean-free path, meaning that the two atoms are embedded in an average
scattering dispersive medium. Finally we show that saturation-induced
nonlinearities strongly modify the atomic scattering properties and, as a
consequence, provide a source of decoherence in multiple scattering. This is
exemplified by considering the coherent backscattering configuration where
interference effects are blurred by this decoherence mechanism. This leads to a
decrease of the so-called coherent backscattering enhancement factor.

microwave field, and to produce macroscopic cat states by virtue of a

system can be implemented by a superconducting quantum circuit with a broken
symmetry in its effective potential. Using the cyclic population transfer,
controllable single-mode photon states can be created in the third transition
when two classical fields are applied to induce the other two transitions. This
is because, for large detuning, two classical fields are equivalent to an
effective external force, which derives the quantized single mode. Our approach
is valid not only for superconducting quantum circuits but also for any
three-level quantum system with $\Delta$-shaped transitions
