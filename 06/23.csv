Observatory. The XMM-Newton observations confirm the existence of the diffuse
emission with a trail morphology lying in a direction opposite to the
transverse motion of the pulsar. The trail has a length of ~15 arcmin. Its
spectrum is non-thermal and produced by electron-synchrotron emission in the
shock between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium. Assuming that the
electron lifetime against synchrotron cooling is comparable to the source
transit time over the X-ray trail length, the magnetic field strength in the
trail emitting region is inferred to be ~5 uG. Inspecting data from the
Effelsberg 11cm radio continuum survey of the Galactic plane we discovered an
elongated feature apparently coincident with the X-ray trail. The emission
properties observed from PSR 1929+10 are found to finally challenge the picture
of the emission properties of old non-recycled rotation powered pulsars. Both,
the temporal and spectral X-ray emission properties of PSR 1929+10 are in
excellent agreement with a non-thermal and, thus, magnetospheric radiation
dominated emission scenario. A flux contribution from the thermal emission of
heated polar caps of ~7% is inferred from a best fitting composite Planckian
and power law spectral model. The X-ray pulse profile is found to be markedly
different from the broad sinusoidal pulse profile seen in the low statistic
ROSAT data. Simulations in the framework of an outer-gap emission model are
able to reproduce the observed X-ray pulse profile and its phase relation
relative to the radio pulse.

astronomical clocks (millisecond pulsars, pulsars in binary systems and
pulsating white dwarfs) to constrain this acceleration. No evidence for
non-zero acceleration has been found; the typical sensitivity achieved by our
method is a/c=a few times 10^{-19} s^{-1}, comparable to the acceleration due
to a Jupiter-mass planet at 200 AU. The acceleration method is limited by the
uncertainties in the distances and by the timing precision for pulsars in
binary systems, and by the intrinsic distribution of the period derivatives for
millisecond pulsars. Timing data provide stronger constraints than residuals in
the motions of comets or planets if the distance to the companion exceeds a few
hundred AU. The acceleration method is also more sensitive to the presence of a
distant companion (> 300-400 AU) than existing optical and infrared surveys. We
outline the differences between the effects of the peculiar acceleration of the

intensities. Pupil mapping is therefore a candidate technique for coronagraphic
imaging of extrasolar planets around nearby stars. Unlike most other
high-contrast imaging techniques, pupil mapping is lossless and preserves the
full angular resolution of the collecting telescope. So, it could possibly give
the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any proposed single-telescope system for
detecting extrasolar planets. Prior analyses based on pupil-to-pupil
ray-tracing indicate that a planet fainter than 10^{-10} times its parent star,
and as close as about 2 lambda/D, should be detectable. In this paper, we
describe the results of careful diffraction analysis of pupil mapping systems.
These results reveal a serious unresolved issue. Namely, high-contrast pupil
mappings distribute light from very near the edge of the first pupil to a broad
area of the second pupil and this dramatically amplifies diffraction-based edge
effects resulting in a limiting attainable contrast of about 10^{-5}. We hope
that by identifying this problem others will provide a solution.

containing black holes. The strongest outflows occur in the radio-loud systems,
in which the accretion disk is likely to have an advection-dominated structure.
In these systems, it is clear that the binding energy of the accreting gas is
emitted primarily in the form of particles rather than radiation. However, no
comprehensive model for the disk structure and the associated outflows has yet
been produced. In particular, none of the existing models establishes a direct
physical connection between the presence of the outflows and the action of a
microphysical acceleration mechanism operating in the disk. In this paper we
explore the possibility that the relativistic protons powering the jet are
accelerated at a standing, centrifugally-supported shock in the underlying
accretion disk via the first-order Fermi mechanism. The theoretical analysis
employed here parallels the early studies of cosmic-ray acceleration in
supernova shock waves, and the particle acceleration and disk structure are
treated in a coupled, self-consistent manner based on a rigorous mathematical
approach. We find that first-order Fermi acceleration at standing shocks in
advection-dominated disks proves to be a very efficient means for accelerating
the jet particles. Using physical parameters appropriate for M87 and SgrA*, we
verify that the jet kinetic luminosities computed using our model agree with
estimates based on observations of the sources.

26 QSOs acquired for a recently completed survey of H_2 by Ledoux et al.

together with those of C I, C I*, C I**, C II* and singly ionized atomic
species to discuss the kinetic temperature, the density of hydrogen and the
electronic density in the gas together with the ambient UV radiation field.
Detailed comparisons are made between the observed properties in DLAs, the
interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy, LMC and SMC. The mean kinetic
temperature of the gas corresponding to DLA subcomponents in which H_2
absorption line is detected, derived from the ortho-to-para ratio (153+/-78 K),
is higher than that measured in the ISM (77+/-17 K) and the Magellanic clouds
(82+/-21 K). Typical pressure in these components (corresponding to T = 100-300
K and n = 10-200 cm^-3), measured using C I fine-structure excitation, are
higher than what is measured along ISM sightlines. This is consistent with the
corresponding higher values for N(H_2,J=2)/N(H_2,J=0) seen in DLAs. From the
column densities of the high-J rotational levels, we derive that the typical
radiation field in the H_2 bearing components is of the order of or slightly
higher than the mean UV field in the Galactic ISM. Determination of electron
density in the gas with H_2 and C I show the ionization rate is similar to that
of a cold neutral medium (CNM) in a moderate radiation field. This, together
with the fact that we see H_2 in 13-20% of the DLAs, can be used to conclude
that DLAs at z>1.9 could contribute as much as 50% star formation rate density
seen in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). (Abridged)

the first steps in the formation of present day galaxies. Here we present
calculations that self-consistently determine the gas ionization, level
populations (atomic fine-structure levels and rotational levels of H_2), grain
physics, and chemistry. We show that for a low-density gas (n< 0.1 cm^-3) the
meta-galactic UV background due to quasars is sufficient to maintain H_2 column
densities below the detection limit (i.e N(H_2)< 10^14 cm^-2) irrespective of
the metallicity and dust content in the gas. Such a gas will have a 21 cm spin
temperature in excess of 7000 K and very low C I and C II* column densities for
H I column densities typically observed in DLAs. We show that the observed
properties of the ~15% per cent of the DLAs that do show detectable H_2
absorption cannot be reproduced with only the quasar dominated meta-galactic UV
radiation field. Gas with higher densities (n>10 cm^-3), a moderate radiation
field (flux density one to ten times that of the background radiation of the
Galactic ISM), the observed range of metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio
reproduce all the observed properties of the DLAs that show H_2 absorption
lines. This favors the presence of ongoing star formation in DLAs with H_2. The
absence of detectable H_2 and C I absorption in a large fraction of DLAs can be
explained if they originate either in a low-density gas or in a high-density
gas with a large ambient radiation field. The absence of 21 cm absorption and C
II* absorption will be consistent with the first possibility. The presence of
21 cm absorption and strong C II* without H_2 and C I absorption will suggest
the second alternative. (Abridged)

is described by a tower of flow parameters that can be evolved in time to
select a particular subset of points in the space of cosmological observables.
We analyze the stability of the fixed points in all the cosmologies (our
results in the 4D case already extending those in the literature). Numerical
integration of the flow equations shows that the predictions of the
Gauss-Bonnet braneworld differ significantly as compared to the Randall-Sundrum

than those in the presence of a normal scalar field. These results are extended
to the realization of a noncommutative space-time preserving maximal symmetry.
In this case the tensor-to-scalar signal is unchanged, while blue-tilted
spectra are favoured.

Galaxies with a radio-halo sets a degenerate constraint on the magnetic field
strength, the relativistic electron density and their spatial distributions.
Using the Coma radio-halo as a case-study, predictions are made for the
brightness profile expected in the 20-80 keV band due to ICS by the
relativistic electrons on the CMB, for a range of central values of the
magnetic field B_0 and models of its radial dependence. We show that the
presence of B-field scalar fluctuations on small scales tends to systematically
depress the electron density required by the radio data, hence to decrease the
ICS brightness expected. These predictions are useful to evaluate the
sensitivity required in future imaging HXR instruments, in order to obtain
direct information on the spatial distribution and content of relativistic
electrons, hence on the magnetic field properties. If compared with the flux in
the Coma HXR tail - interpreted as ICS from within the radius R_h - the
predictions lead to values of B_0 which are lower than those obtained from
Faraday Rotation measurements. The discrepancy is somewhat reduced if the
radio-halo profile is extrapolated out to R_{vir}, i.e. about 3 R_h, or if it
is assumed that B(r) \propto n_{th}(r) (Dolag et al. 2002). Note that in the
latter case, n_{rel}(r) has its minimum value at the center of the cluster. If
real and from ICS, the bulk of the HXR tail should then be contributed by
electrons other than those responsible for the bulk of the radio-halo emission.
This case illustrates the need for spatially resolved spectroscopy in the HXR,
in order to obtain solid information on the non-thermal content of Clusters of
Galaxies.

propose a coarse-grained master equation for the order parameter dynamics which

using streakline photography and image analysis . The stress profile is
computed from the number density profile using a force balance taking into
account wall friction. The profiles for the mean velocity superimpose when
distance is scaled by the particle diameter and the velocity by a
characteristic shear rate and the particle diameter. The mean velocity is found
to decay exponentially with depth in the bed with a decay length of
$\lambda=1.1d$. The r.m.s. velocity is nearly constant near the free surface
and below a transition point it decays linearly with depth. The shear rate,
obtained by numerical differentiation of the velocity profile, shows a maximum
which occurs at the same depth as the transition in the r.m.s. velocity
profile. The velocity distribution is Maxwellian above the transition point and
a Poisson velocity distribution is obtained deep in the layer. The variation of
the apparent viscosity ($\eta$) with r.m.s. velocity ($u$) shows a relatively
sharp transition at the shear rate maximum, and in the region below this point
the apparent viscosity varies as $\eta\sim u^{-1.5}$. The experimental data is

renormalizes towards the chain, with the infinite disorder fixed point

[II,(II)], by Petrov classification, is an exact solution of the Einstein
equations and contains two horizons. The equation of state in the radial
direction, is a well-behaved function of the density and smoothly reproduces
vacuum-like behavior near r=0 while tending to a polytrope at larger r, low
density, values. The final equilibrium configuration comprises of a de
Sitter-like inner core surrounded by a family of 2-surfaces of matter fields
with variable equation of state. The fields are all concentrated in the
vicinity of the radial center r=0. The solution depicts a spacetime that is
asymptotically Schwarzschild at large r, while it becomes de Sitter-like for
vanishing r. Possible physical interpretations of the macro-state of the black
hole interior in the model are offered. We find that the possible state admits
two equally viable interpretations, namely either a quintessential intermediary
region or a phase transition in which a two-fluid system is in both dynamic and
thermodynamic equilibrium. We estimate the ratio of pure matter present to the
total energy and in both (interpretations) cases find it to be virtually the
same, being 0.83. Finally, the well-behaved dependence of the density and
pressure on the radial coordinate provides some insight on dealing with the
information loss paradox.

for multi-GeV electrons and photons interacting with oriented single crystals.
The various types of crystals and their orientations were used for producing
photon beams and for converting and measuring their polarisation.
  The radiation emitted by 178 GeV unpolarised electrons incident on a 1.5 cm
thick Si crystal oriented in the Coherent Bremsstrahlung (CB) and the
String-of-Strings (SOS) modes was used to obtain multi-GeV linearly polarised
photon beams.
  A new crystal polarimetry technique was established for measuring the linear
polarisation of the photon beam. The polarimeter is based on the dependence of
the Coherent Pair Production (CPP) cross section in oriented single crystals on
the direction of the photon polarisation with respect to the crystal plane.
Both a 1 mm thick single crystal of Germanium and a 4 mm thick multi-tile set
of synthetic Diamond crystals were used as analyzers of the linear
polarisation.
  A birefringence phenomenon, the conversion of the linear polarisation of the
photon beam into circular polarisation, was observed. This was achieved by
letting the linearly polarised photon beam pass through a 10 cm thick Silicon
single crystal that acted as a ""quarter wave plate"" (QWP) as suggested by N.

introduce a formulation of medium-induced parton energy loss, which treats all

show that the strong suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra measured in

large hierarchy between various supersymmetry breaking terms, a good example
being the models of split supersymmetry. However, theoretical models generating
such a stable hierarchy are not so easy to construct. An interesting idea
consists in coupling the brane localized gauge sector to extended
supergravities in the bulk of extra dimensions, and using different sources of
supersymmetry breaking in the bulk and on the brane. This in principle allows
one to separate the magnitude of the gravitino mass from the supersymmetry
breaking masses of gaugini and of charged matter. In this paper we present a
detailed analysis of a simple field theoretical model where such an idea is
realized. Departure from this symmetric set of boundary conditions breaks
R-symmetry, and gaugino masses are generated at one-loop order, however the
magnitude of the resulting soft gaugino masses is proportional to the
R-symmetry breaking Majorana-type gravitino mass which is continously
deformable to zero.

instantaneous energy injection, we solve the full kinetic equation for the

source term is based on the requirement that the injected energy be almost
instantaneously redistributed by Compton scattering, hence leading to a
time-dependent chemical potential. We investigate the case of a stau NLSP and
determine the constraints on the gravitino and stau masses from observations of

gluons coincide. However, in order to fulfill the bootstrap relation for the
BFKL kernel it is necessary to modify the space of functions. We define and
investigate a new space of functions and show explicitly that the bootstrap
relation is valid for the corresponding spectral form of the kernel. We
calculate the generators of the resulting deformed representation of the
sl(2,C) algebra.

conjecture that the behavior of zeros near the central point should be well
modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near 1 of a classical compact group. By
studying the 1- and 2-level densities, we find evidence of underlying
symplectic and SO(even) symmetry, respectively. This should be contrasted with
previous results of Iwaniec-Luo-Sarnak for the families {L(s,f): f in H_k(1)}

symplectic symmetry, respectively. The present examples suggest a relation
between the symmetry type of a family and that of its twistings, which will be
further studied in a subsequent paper. Both the GL(4) and the GL(6) families
above have all even functional equations, and neither is naturally split from
an orthogonal family. A folklore conjecture states that such families must be
symplectic, which is true for the first family but false for the second. Thus
the theory of low lying zeros is more than just a theory of signs of functional
equations. An analysis of these families suggest that it is the second moment

  This paper presents a classical sequent calculus which is also free of
contraction and weakening, but more symmetrically: both contraction and
weakening are absorbed into conjunction, leaving the axiom rule intact. It uses
a blended conjunction rule, combining the standard context-sharing and
context-splitting rules: Gamma,Delta,A and Gamma,Sigma,B implies
Gamma,Delta,Sigma,(A and B). We refer to this system M as minimal sequent

  We prove a minimality theorem for the propositional fragment Mp: any

algebras. We construct the irreducible representations of these algebras in the
generic case and use this to show that these algebras are free of rank
$r^n(2n-1)!!$ (when $\Omega$ is $\bu$--admissible). We next show that these

cyclotomic Nazarov--Wenzl algebras over an arbitrary field. In particular, this
gives a construction of all of the finite dimensional irreducible modules of
the affine Weyl algebra (when $\Omega$ is admissible).

in the recently proposed non-Aristotelian finitary logic (NAFL). Constructive
real analysis in NAFL (NRA) is accomplished by a translation of diagrammatic
concepts from Euclidean geometry into an extension (NPAR) of the NAFL version
of Peano Arithmetic (NPA). Such a translation is possible because NPA proves
the existence of every infinite proper class of natural numbers that is
definable in the language of NPA. Infinite sets are not permitted in NPAR and
quantification over proper classes is banned; hence Cantor's diagonal argument
cannot be legally formulated in NRA, and there is no `cardinality' for any
collection (`super-class') of real numbers. Many of the useful aspects of
classical real analysis, such as, the calculus of Newton and Leibniz, are
justifiable in NRA. But the paradoxes, such as, Zeno's paradoxes of motion and
the Banach-Tarski paradox, are resolved because NRA admits only closed
super-classes of real numbers; in particular, open/semi-open intervals of real
numbers are not permitted. The NAFL version of computability theory (NCT)
rejects Turing's argument for the undecidability of the halting problem and
permits hypercomputation. Important potential applications of NCT are in the
areas of quantum and autonomic computing.

layers with misaligned in-plane anisotropy at the frequency close to a photonic

increase in field intensity and group delay associated with the transmission
resonance. The field enhancement appears to be proportional to forth degree of
the number N of layers in the stack. By contrast, in common periodic stacks of
isotropic layers, those effects are much weaker and proportional to N^2. Thus,
the anisotropy allows to drastically reduce the size of the resonance cavity
with similar performance. The key characteristic of the periodic arrays with
the gigantic transmission resonance is that the dispersion curve omega(k)at the
photonic band edge has the degenerate form Delta(omega) ~ Delta(k)^4, rather
than the regular form Delta(omega) ~ Delta(k)^2. This can be realized in
specially arranged stacks of misaligned anisotropic layers. The degenerate band
edge cavity resonance with similar outstanding properties can also be realized

orientation, in a linear, rigid rotor model. With the help of a monotonically
convergent algorithm, we find that the optimal field is in the microwave part
of the spectrum and acts by resonantly exciting the rotation of the molecule
progressively from the ground state, i.e., by rotational ladder climbing. This
mechanism is present not only when maximizing orientation or alignment, but
also when using prescribed target states that simultaneously optimize the
efficiency of orientation/alignment and its duration. The extension of the
optimization method to consider a finite rotational temperature is also
presented.

discussed by first calculating the interaction of point charge with a simple
model magnetic moment and then suggesting a multiparticle limit. The Darwin
Lagrangian is used to analyze the electromagnetic behavior of the model
magnetic moment (composed of two oppositely charged particles of different mass
in an initially circular orbit) interacting with a passing point charge. The
changing mangetic moment is found to put a force back on a passing charge; this
force is of order 1/c^2 and depends upon the magnitude of the magnetic moment.
It is suggested that in the limit of a multiparticle magnetic toroid, the
electric fields of the passing charge are screened out of the body of the
magnet while the magnetic fields penetrate into the magnet. This is consistent
with our understanding of the penetration of electromagnetic velocity fields
into ohmic conductors. Conservation laws are discussed. The work corresponds to
a classical electromagnetic analysis of the interaction which is basic to
understanding the controversy over the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase
shifts and represents a refutation of the suggestions of Aharonov, Pearle, and
Vaidman.

species effected by a sudden spike in mortality due to an extreme event. In our
study, the animal species has a 2-year life cycle and is endowed with a high
survival probability under normal circumstances. Our proposed approach does not
involve any restraining assumptions concerning environmental variables or
predator-prey relationships. Rather it is based on the simple premise that if
observed on an year-to-year basis, the population size will be noted to either
have gone up or come down as compared to last year. The conceptualization is
borrowed from the theory of asset pricing in stochastic finance. Our results
indicate that an extreme event with a maximum shock size (i.e. the maximum
number of immediate mortalities that may be caused by an extreme event)
exceeding two-thirds the size of the pristine population can potentially drive
any animal species with a 2-year life cycle to extinction for any fecundity
level.

formation, in its standard model the number of stripes changes with the system

size, that is often required in biological morphogeneis. To get over this
problem, we show that the Turing pattern can preserve proportionality by
introducing a catalytic chemical whose concentration depends on the system

classical phase-space rather than on the global dynamical regime. As a
consequence regular classical dynamics can in certain circumstances be
associated with higher entanglement generation than chaotic dynamics. In
addition quantum effects also come into play: for example partial revivals,
which are expected to persist in the semiclassical limit, affect the long time
behaviour of the reduced linear entropy. These results suggest that
entanglement may not be a pertinent universal signature of chaos.

a systematic way, expanding on our previous work on secure key from bound
entanglement [K. Horodecki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005)]. More detailed
proofs, discussion and examples are provided of the main results. Namely, we
demonstrate that all quantum cryptographic protocols can be recast in a way
which looks like entanglement theory, with the only change being that instead
of distilling EPR pairs, the parties distill private states. The form of these
general private states are given, and we show that there are a number of useful
ways of expressing them. Some of the private states can be approximated by
certain states which are bound entangled. Thus distillable entanglement is not
a requirement for a private key. We find that such bound entangled states are
useful for a cryptographic primitive we call a controlled private quantum
channel. We also find a general class of states which have negative partial
transpose (are NPT), but which appear to be bound entangled. The relative
entropy distance is shown to be an upper bound on the rate of key. This allows
us to compute the exact value of distillable key for a certain class of private
states.

we pursue these studies for the case of multi-particle systems. We use as a
prototype the degenerate electron gas whose dynamics is well known in the
commutative limit. Our central aim here is to understand qualitatively, rather
than quantitatively, the main modifications induced by the presence of
noncommutative coordinates. We shall first see that the noncommutativity
modifies the exchange correlation energy while preserving the electric
neutrality of the model. By employing time-independent perturbation theory
together with the Seiberg-Witten map we show, afterwards, that the ionization
potential is modified by the noncommutativity. It also turns out that the
noncommutative parameter acts as a reference temperature. Hence, the
noncommutativity lifts the degeneracy of the zero temperature electron gas.

can also lead to new effective interactions within these systems. Here the
problem of low energy quantum scattering by a spherically symmetric short range
potential in the presence of a general cylindrical confinement is investigated.
A Green's function formalism is developed which accounts for the full 3D nature
of the scattering potential by incorporating all phase-shifts and their
couplings. This quasi-1D geometry gives rise to scattering resonances and
weakly localized states, whose binding energies and wavefunctions can be
systematically calculated. Possible applications include e.g. impurity
scattering in ballistic quasi-1D quantum wires in mesoscopic systems and in
atomic matter wave guides. In the particular case of parabolic confinement, the
present formalism can also be applied to pair collision processes such as
two-body interactions. Weakly bound pairs and quasi-molecules induced by the
confinement and having zero or higher orbital angular momentum can be
predicted, such as p- and d-wave pairings.
