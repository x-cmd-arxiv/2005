galaxies using a GRAPE-SPH code that includes various physical processes that
are associated with the formation of stellar systems: radiative cooling, star
formation, feedback from Type II and Ia supernovae and stellar winds, and
chemical enrichment. We find that the star formation timescale controls when
and where stars form in the contracting gas cloud, determines the effective
radius at given mass, and is constrained by observation to be ten times longer
than the local dynamical timescale. We succeed in reproducing the observed
global scaling relations under our CDM-based scenario, e.g., the Faber-Jackson
relation, the Kormendy relation, and the fundamental plane. An intrinsic
scatter exists along the fundamental plane, and the origin of this scatter lies
in differences in merging history. Galaxies that undergo major merger events
tend to have larger effective radii and fainter surface brightnesses, which
result in larger masses, smaller surface brightnesses, and larger mass-to-light
ratios. We can also reproduce the observed colour-magnitude and
mass-metallicity relations, although the scatter is larger than observed. The
scatter arises because feedback is not very effective and star formation does
not terminate completely in our simulations. ~25% of accreted baryons are blown
away in the simulations, independent of the assumed star formation timescale
and initial mass function. Most heavy elements end up locked into stars in the
galaxy. The ejected metal fraction depends only on the star formation
timescale, and is ~2% even to rapid star formation.

plasmas by driving convection in the intracluster medium. A model is proposed
in which a central supermassive black hole accretes intracluster plasma at the
Bondi rate and powers a radio source. The central radio source produces cosmic
rays, which mix into the thermal plasma. The cosmic-ray luminosity is
proportional to the mass accretion rate. The cosmic-ray pressure gradient
drives convection, which causes plasma heating. It is assumed that plasma
heating balances radiative cooling. The plasma heating rate is self-regulating
because the Bondi accretion rate is a decreasing function of the specific
entropy near the cluster center; if heating exceeds cooling, then the central
entropy increases, the Bondi rate and cosmic-ray luminosity decrease, and the
convective heating rate is reduced. This paper focuses on the role of
intracluster magnetic fields, which affect convection by causing heat and
cosmic rays to diffuse primarily along magnetic field lines. A new stability
criterion is derived for convection in a thermal-plasma/cosmic-ray fluid, and
equations for the average fluid properties in a convective cluster are obtained
with the use of a nonlocal two-fluid mixing length theory. Numerical solutions
of the model equations compare reasonably well with observations without
requiring fine tuning of the model parameters.

intermediate-to-heavy mass elements. Very massive stars with mass $\geq 8
M_{\odot}$ culminate their evolution by supernova explosions which are presumed
to be the most viable candidate astrophysical sites of r-process
nucleosynthesis. If the models for the supernova r-process are correct, then
nucleosynthesis results could also pose a significant constraint on the remnant
of supernova explosions, $i.e.$ neutron star or black hole. In the case of very
massive core collapse, a remnant stellar black hole is thought to be formed.
Intense neutrino flux from the neutronized core and the neutrino sphere might
suddenly cease during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase because of the black
hole formation. It is interesting to explore observable consequences of such a
neutrino flux truncation. Arguments have recently been given in the literature
that even the neutrino mass may be determined from the time delay of deformed
neutrino energy spectrum after the cease of neutrino ejection (neutrino cutoff
effect). Here, we study the expected theoretical response of the r-process
nucleosynthesis to the neutrino cutoff effect in order to look for another
independent signature of this phenomenon. We found a sensitive response of the
r-process yield if the neutrino cutoff occurs after the critical time when the
expanding materials in the neutrino-driven wind drop out of the Nuclear
Statistical Equilibrium (NSE). The r-process nucleosynthesis yields change
maximally if the cutoff occurs during the r-process. Using this result,
connected with future detection of the time-variation of SN neutrino spectrum,
we are able to identify when the black hole formation occurs in the course of
SN collapse.

galaxy of GRB021004 (z=2.33). Although this GRB is one of the best observed so
far, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations of
data sets on this burst in the literature. We have observed the field of
GRB021004 with the HST at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 months
after the burst. With STIS spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700AA
in the restframe. From the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of the
Lyman-limit we constrain the HI column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 Based
on ACS and NICMOS imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromatically
within the errors. The color changes observed by other authors during the first
four days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on an
afterglow component with a constant spectral shape. This achromaticity implies
that the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of the
spectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. The optical-to-X-ray slope is
consistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. This
indicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according to
fireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.
The late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and is
inconsistent with a single power-law. This could be due to a late-time
flattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due to
excess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. The host is a
starburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong Ly-alpha emission.
The afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the host
suggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.

quasi-tetrahedron with surrounding host atoms through bonding and nonbonding
interaction associated with production of electronic holes and antibonding

Bond order loss lowers the atomic cohesive energy that determines the
temperature of melting (Tm), or the activation energy for atomic dislocation,
whereas bond strength gain enhances the energy density, or mechanical strength,
in the surface skin. Therefore, the surface is harder at T << Tm whereas the
surface becomes softer when the T approaches the surface Tm that is lower than
the bulk due to bond order loss. Hence, the strained nanostructures are usually
stiffer at low T whereas the harder skins melt easier. Quantitative information

correlation mechanism has been developed, which has enabled the tunability of a
variety of properties of a nanosolid in connection with surface to be
consistently predicted and experimentally verified. The BOLS correlation
indicates that the coordination number (CN) imperfection of an atom at site
surrounding a defect or in the surface skin causes the remaining bonds of the
lower-coordinated atom to contract spontaneously. The spontaneous bond
contraction is associated with bond-strength gain or atomic potential well
deppression, which localize electrons and enhance the density of charge, mass,
and energy in the relaxed region. The enhancement of energy density in the
relaxed region perturbs the Hamiltonian and the associated properties such as
the band-gap width, core-level energy, Stokes shift (electron-phonon
interaction), and dielectric susceptibility. On the other hand, bond order loss
lowers generally the cohesive energy of the lower-coordinated atom from the
value of a fully-coordinated atom, which dictates the thermodynamic process
such as self-assembly growth, atomic vibration, thermal stability, and
activation energies for atomic dislocation and diffusion. Consistency between
predictions and observations evidences the enormous impact of atomic CN
imperfection and the validity and essentiality of the BOLS correlation.

parameters $p$ is much larger than the number of observations $n$. Suppose then
that we have observations $y=X\beta+z$, where $\beta\in\mathbf{R}^p$ is a
parameter vector of interest, $X$ is a data matrix with possibly far fewer rows
than columns, $n\ll p$, and the $z_i$'s are i.i.d. $N(0,\sigma^2)$. Is it
possible to estimate $\beta$ reliably based on the noisy data $y$? To estimate
$\beta$, we introduce a new estimator--we call it the Dantzig selector--which
is a solution to the $\ell_1$-regularization problem \[\min_{\tilde{\b
eta}\in\mathbf{R}^p}\|\tilde{\beta}\|_{\ell_1}\quad subject to\quad
\|X^*r\|_{\ell_{\infty}}\leq(1+t^{-1})\sqrt{2\log p}\cdot\sigma,\] where $r$ is
the residual vector $y-X\tilde{\beta}$ and $t$ is a positive scalar. We show
that if $X$ obeys a uniform uncertainty principle (with unit-normed columns)
and if the true parameter vector $\beta$ is sufficiently sparse (which here
roughly guarantees that the model is identifiable), then with very large
probability, \[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|_{\ell_2}^2\le C^2\cdot2\log p\cdot
\Biggl(\sigma^2+\sum_i\min(\beta_i^2,\sigma^2)\Biggr).\] Our results are
nonasymptotic and we give values for the constant $C$. Even though $n$ may be
much smaller than $p$, our estimator achieves a loss within a logarithmic
factor of the ideal mean squared error one would achieve with an oracle which
would supply perfect information about which coordinates are nonzero, and which
were above the noise level. In multivariate regression and from a model
selection viewpoint, our result says that it is possible nearly to select the
best subset of variables by solving a very simple convex program, which, in
fact, can easily be recast as a convenient linear program (LP).

importance for physics. Experiments to search for PNC effects have been
performed on TlF and YbF molecules and are in progress for PbO and PbF

calculate those needed molecular properties which cannot be measured. In
particular, electronic densities in heavy-atom cores are required for
interpretation of the measured data in terms of the P,T-odd properties of
elementary particles or P,T-odd interactions between them. Reliable
calculations of the core properties (PNC effect, hyperfine structure etc.,

nuclei) usually require accurate accounting for both relativistic and
correlation effects in heavy-atom systems. In this paper, some basic aspects of
