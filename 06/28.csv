translated the observed colors of the stars in the CMD to abundances and
constructed a metallicity distribution function (MDF) for this region. The MDF
shows a peak at [M/H]~0 with a steep decline at higher metallicities and a more
gradual tail to lower metallicities. This is similar in shape to the MDF of the
Milky Way bulge but shifted to higher metallicities by ~0.1 dex. As is the case
with the Milky Way bulge MDF, a pure closed box model of chemical evolution,
even with significant pre-enrichment, appears to be inconsistent with the M31
bulge MDF. However, a scenario in which an initial infall of gas enriched the
bulge to an abundance of [M/H] ~ -1.6 with subsequent evolution proceeding as a
closed box provides a better fit to the observed MDF. The similarity between
the MDF of the M31 bulge and that of the Milky Way stands in stark contrast to
the significant differences in the MDFs of their halo populations. This
suggests that the bulk of the stars in the bulges of both galaxies were in
place before the accretion events that occurred in the halos could influence
them.

surface soon ceases to show strong signs of the subsurface dynamics of its
parent magnetic structure. This indicates that some kind of disconnection of
the emerged flux from its roots in the deep convection zone should take place.
We propose a mechanism for the dynamical disconnection of the surface flux
based upon the buoyant upflow of plasma along the field lines. Such flows arise
in the upper part of a rising flux loop during the final phases of its buoyant
ascent towards the surface. The combination of the pressure buildup by the
upflow and the cooling of the upper layers of an emerged flux tube by radiative
losses at the surface lead to a progressive weakening of the magnetic field in
several Mm depth. When the field strength has become sufficiently low,
convective motions and the fluting instability disrupt the flux tube into thin,
passively advected flux fragments, thus providing a dynamical disconnection of
the emerged part from its roots. We substantiate this scenario by considering
the quasi-static evolution of a sunspot model under the effects of radiative
cooling, convective energy transport, and pressure buildup by a prescribed
inflow at the bottom of the model. For inflow speeds in the range shown by
simulations of thin flux tubes, we find that the disconnection takes place in a
depth between 2 and 6 Mm for disconnection times up to 3 days.

spectral classification is available show a V-type spectra. Before the
discovery of 1459 Magnya (Lazzaro et al. 2000) and of several V-type NEA (Xu

Recently two V-type asteroids, 809 Lundia and 956 Elisa, (Florczak et al. 2002)
have been discovered well outside the limits of the family, near the Flora
family. We currently know 22 V-type asteroids outside the family, in the inner

are former family members that migrated to their current positions via the
interplay of Yarkovsky effect and nonlinear secular resonances. The main
dynamical feature of 956 Elisa and 809 Lundia is that they are currently inside
the 2(g-g6)+s-s6 (z2 by Milani and Knezevic, 1993) secular resonance. Our
investigations show that members of the Vesta dynamical family may drift in
three-body and weak secular resonances until they are captured in the strong z2
secular resonance. Only asteroids with diameters larger than 16 km can remain
in one of the three-body or secular resonances long enough to reach the region
of the z2 resonance. This two-step mechanism of capture into the z2 resonance
could explain: i) the current resonant orbits of 956 Elisa and 809 Lundia, ii)
why their size is significantly larger than that of the typical member of the

that the dust thermal spectrum possesses scaling relations that provide a
natural classification for a broad range of sources, from low-mass protostars

energy distributions (SEDs) can be characterized by two distance-independent
parameters, the luminosity-to-mass ratio, $L/M$, and the surface density,
$\Sigma$, for a set of two functions, namely, the density profile and the
opacity curve. The goal is to use SEDs as a diagnostic tool in inferring the
large-scale physical conditions in protostellar and extragalactic sources, and
ultimately, evolutionary parameters. Our approach obviates the need to use SED
templates in the millimeter to far-infrared region of the spectrum; this is a
common practice in the extragalactic community that relies on observed
correlations established at low redshift that may not necessarily extend to
high redshift. Further, we demarcate the limited region of parameter space in
which density profiles can be inferred from the SED, which is of particular
import in the protostellar community as competing theories of star formation
are characterized by different density profiles. The functionality of our model
is unique in that in provides for a self-consistent analytic solution that we
have validated by comparison with a well-tested radiative transfer code (DUSTY)
to find excellent agreement with numerical results over a parameter space that
spans low-mass protostars to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGS).

structure of the luminous halos that surround isolated galaxies. These stellar
structures extend out to several hundred kpc away from a galaxy, and consist of
stars shed by merging subunits during the many accretion events that
characterize the hierarchical assembly of galaxies. Such origin suggests that
outer luminous halos are ubiquitous and that they should appear as an excess of
light over extrapolations of the galaxy's inner profile beyond its traditional
luminous radius. The mass profile of the accreted stellar component is well
approximated by a model where the logarithmic slope steepens monotonically with
radius; from -3 at the luminous edge of the galaxy to -4 or steeper near the
virial radius of the system. Such spatial distribution is consistent with that
of Galactic and M31 globular clusters, suggesting that many of the globulars
were brought in by accretion events, in a manner akin to the classic
Searle-Zinn scenario. The outer stellar spheroid is supported by a velocity
dispersion tensor with a substantial and radially increasing radial anisotropy.
These properties distinguish the stellar halo from the dark matter component,
which is more isotropic in velocity space, as well as from some tracers of the
outer spheroid such as satellite galaxies. Most stars in the outer halo formed
in progenitors that have since merged with the central galaxy; very few stars
in the halo are contributed by satellites that survive as self-bound entities
at the present. These features are in reasonable agreement with recent
observations of the outer halo of the MW, of M31, and of other isolated
spirals, and suggest that all of these systems underwent an early period of
active merging, as envisioned in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

Nearby Survey), a large spectroscopic survey of the infall regions surrounding
nine nearby rich clusters of galaxies. Our long-slit spectroscopy yields
estimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to the
general large-scale structure. The fraction of galaxies with current star
formation in their inner disks as traced by H-alpha emission increases with
distance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3
virial radii, in agreement with other investigations. However, among galaxies
with significant current star formation (EW[Ha]geq2\AA), there is no difference
in the distribution of EW[Ha] inside and outside the virial radius. This
surprising result, first seen by Carter et al., suggests that (1) star
formation is truncated on either very short timescales or only at moderate and
high redshifts or (2) that projection effects contaminate the measurement. The
number density profiles of star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies indicate
that, among galaxies projected inside the virial radius, at least half of the
former and 20% of the latter are ``infall interlopers,'' galaxies in the infall
region but outside the virial region. The kinematics of star-forming galaxies
in the infall region closely match those of absorption-dominated galaxies. This
result shows that the star forming galaxies in the infall regions are not
interlopers from the field and excludes one model of the backsplash scenario of
galaxy transformation. Finally, we quantify systematic uncertainties in
estimating the global star formation in galaxies from their inner disks.

selected from the MUSYC and NDWFS surveys. In the full sample 67 galaxies (53%)
show morphological signatures of tidal interactions, consisting of broad fans
of stars, tails, and other asymmetries at very faint surface brightness levels.
When restricting the sample to the 86 bulge-dominated early-type galaxies the
fraction of tidally disturbed galaxies rises to 71%, which implies that for
every ``normal'' undisturbed elliptical there are two which show clear signs of
interactions. The tidal features are red and smooth, and often extend over >50
kpc. Of the tidally distorted galaxies about 2/3 are remnants and 1/3 are
interacting with a companion galaxy. The companions are usually bright red
galaxies as well: the median R-band luminosity ratio of the tidal pairs is
0.31, and the median color difference after correcting for the slope of the
color-magnitude relation is -0.02 in B-R. If the ongoing mergers are
representative for the progenitors of the remnants ~35% of bulge-dominated
galaxies experienced a merger with mass ratio >1:4 in the recent past. With
further assumptions it is estimated that the present-day mass accretion rate of
galaxies on the red sequence is 0.09+-0.04 per Gyr. For a constant or
increasing mass accretion rate with redshift, we find that red mergers may lead
to an evolution of a factor of >~2 in the stellar mass density in luminous red
galaxies over the redshift range 0<z<1, consistent with recent studies of the
evolution of the luminosity density. We conclude that most of today's field
elliptical galaxies were assembled at low redshift through ""dry"" mergers of
gas-poor, bulge-dominated systems. [ABRIDGED]

we argue that the companion star in 2S 0918-549 is a helium white dwarf We
first present a Type I X-ray burst from 2S 0918-549 with a long duration of 40
minutes. We show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of pure
helium at the inferred accretion rate of ~0.01 times the Eddington accretion
rate. At higher accretion rates of ~0.1 Eddington, hydrogen is required to
explain long duration bursts. However, at low rates the long duration is due to
the large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst. We show that it
is possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary if
accretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch, when the core is
made of predominantly helium. Furthermore, this scenario naturally explains the
high neon-to-oxgen ratio, without requiring a CO or ONe white dwarf companion.
The only observational aspect of 2S 0918-549 that we cannot explain is the
absence of helium lines in the optical spectrum. Model calculations of optical
accretion disk spectra need to be carried out in order to obtain limits on the
helium abundance.

uncorrelated, with at most a mild anticorrelation and that there is a
dependence of the void number density on redshift at least at the 99.5%

the fact that we use the redshift as the radial coordinate. We calibrate this
technique with mock catalogues and find that the correction might be of some
relevance to carry out accurate inferences from void statistics. We study the
statistics of the galaxies inside nine nearby voids. We find that galaxies in
voids are not randomly distributed: they form structures like filaments. We
also obtain the galaxy number density profile in voids. This profile follow a
similar but steeper trend to that follow by halos in voids.

H13CN, SO and SO2 are detected on < 200 AU scales. The observations are
interpreted using detailed radiative transfer models of the physical and

The continuum emission is explained by an extended envelope and a compact but
resolved component, presumably a circumstellar disk with a diameter of 200-300
AU and a mass of a few times 0.01-0.1 M_sun. If related to the rotation of the
envelope, then the size of this disk suggests a centrifugal barrier of 200-300
AU, which implies that the temperature in the envelope does not increase above
100 K. Its large size also suggests that the build-up of disks proceeds rapidly
throughout the early protostellar stages. The smaller (< 100 AU) disks found
around other deeply embedded protostars may be a result of tidal truncation.
The high-resolution observations of SO can be explained with a simple constant
abundance, ~1E-9, constrained through single-dish observations, whereas those
of H13CN and the organic species require high abundances, increased by one to
two orders of magnitude, or an additional compact source of emission at small
scales. The compact molecular emission could originate in a hot core region of
the inner envelope, but a more likely reservoir is the circumstellar disk.

excellent fit to the pn 0.3-12 keV spectrum was found using a continuum that

including a relativistically broadened Fe K line, strengthening the case for
the existence of such a line. On the whole, the X-ray spectrum of 4C+74.26

comparing the reddening-invariant colors of the most highly variable stars

evidence that the temperature of the accretion shock decreases in the very low

columns. We find that the near-IR excess attributed to circumstellar disk
thermal emission drops rapidly for spectral types later than M4. This is likely
due to the decrease in color contrast between the disk and the cooler stellar
photosphere. Since accretion, which requires a substantial stellar magnetic
field and the presence of a circumstellar disk, is inferred for masses down to

consequencies, especially a lower velocity scatter in DE dominated regions. The
apparent contradiction between the slight dependence of the growth factor on
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and the significant influence of dark energy in realistic
N-body calculations is clarified. An interesting new result is that in the
standard $\Lambda$ cosmology, gravitation dominates around a typical matter
fluctuation up to about the correlation length $r_0$, and we tentatively link
this with the high pairwise velocity dispersion on scales up to several Mpc, as
measured from galaxy redshift-space correlations. Locally, the smooth Hubble
flow on similar scales is consistent with N-body simulations including
$\Omega_{\Lambda} \approx 0.7$ and a low density contrast in the Local Volume,
which make it generally vacuum-dominated beyond 1 - 2 Mpc from galaxies and
groups. We introduce a useful way to view the Hubble flow in terms of ""zero

observed to be expanding, actually participates in accelerating expansion. The
observed insensitiveness of the local velocity dispersion to galaxy mass is

constrain the properties of their stellar populations and their intrinsic Lya
emission. The following main results are obtained for the individual galaxies:
* Triple arc in Abell 2218: The most likely redshift of this source is z ~
6.0-7.2. SED fits indicate generally a low extinction but do not strongly
constrain the star formation (SF) history. Best fits have typical ages of ~3 to
400 Myr. The apparent 4000Ang break observed recently from combination of
IRAC/Spitzer and HST observations, can also equally well be reproduced with the
template of a young (~3-5 Myr). The estimated SFR is typically ~1 Msun/yr, in
agreement with previous estimates. The unknowns on the age and star formation
history could easily explain the apparent absence of Lya in this galaxy. *
Abell 370 HCM 6A: The available Lya and continuum observations indicate two
possible solutions: 1) a young burst or ongoing constant SF with non-negligible
extinction or 2) a composite young+""old"" stellar population. In the first case
one obtains a best fit A_V ~ 0.5-1.8 at a 1 sigma level. In consequence we
obtain SFR ~ 11-41 Msun/yr, higher than earlier estimates, and we estimate a
fairly high total luminosity (L ~ (1-4)*10^{11} Lsun) for this galaxy, in the
range LIRG. A Lya transmission of ~23-90% is estimated from our best fit
models. Other properties remain largely unconstrained. In case of composite
stellar populations the SFR, mass, and luminosity estimate is lower. The two
scenarios may be distinguishable with IRAC/Spitzer observations at 3.6 and 4.5
micron.

satellites and test our results against N-body simulations.
  The tidal radius in general depends upon four factors: the potential of the
host galaxy, the potential of the satellite, the orbit of the satellite and
{\it the orbit of the star within the satellite}. We demonstrate that this last
point is critical and suggest using {\it three tidal radii} to cover the range
of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way we show explicitly that
prograde star orbits will be more easily stripped than radial orbits; while
radial orbits are more easily stripped than retrograde ones. This result has
previously been established by several authors numerically, but can now be
understood analytically. For point mass, power-law (which includes the
isothermal sphere), and a restricted class of split power law potentials our
solution is fully analytic. For more general potentials, we provide an equation
which may be rapidly solved numerically. Over short times ($\simlt 1-2$ Gyrs
$\sim 1$ satellite orbit), we find excellent agreement between our analytic and
numerical models. Over longer times, star orbits within the satellite are
transformed by the tidal field of the host galaxy. In a Hubble time, this
causes a convergence of the three limiting tidal radii towards the prograde
stripping radius. Beyond the prograde stripping radius, the velocity dispersion
will be tangentially anisotropic.

parallactic angle for the slit orientation if slit loss was an important
consideration (either to maximize the signal-to-noise or to do
spectrophotometry). This requires periodic realignment of the slit position
angle as the parallactic angle changes. This is not possible for multi-slit
observations where one slit position angle must be chosen for the entire
exposure. Common wisdom suggests using the parallactic angle at the meridian
(HA=0). In this paper, I examine what the best strategy is for long, multi-slit
exposures. I find that in extreme cases (very long exposure time) the best
choice is to orient the slit \emph{perpendicular} to the parallactic angle at
the meridian. There are two effects to consider: the increasing dispersion with
increasing airmass and the changing angle between the parallactic angle and the
slit. In the case of \emph{traditional} slit orientation, the two effects
amplify each other, thus rendering a significant fraction of the observation
useless. Using the perpendicular orientation, the two processes work against
each other, thus most of the observation remains useful. I will use, as an
example, our 8 hour Lockman Hole observations using the Keck telescope, but
generic methods are given to evaluate a particular observation. I also make the
tools available to the community.

separations of order 1 AU. The resulting high frequency of binary systems with
two massive components is in agreement with observations. These systems are
typically highly eccentric and may evolve to have periastron separations less
than their stellar radii. Mergers of these binary systems are therefore likely
and can lead to the formation of the most massive stars, circumventing the
problem of radiation pressure stopping the accretion. The stellar density
required to induce binary mergers is one million stars per cubic parsec, or
approximately one percent that required for direct stellar collisions.

VVDS-02h deep field. Using U,B,V,R,I and K data, we identified 718 radio
sources (~74% of the whole sample). The photometric redshift analysis shows
that, in each magnitude bin, the radio sample has a higher median photometric
redshift than the whole optical sample, while the median (V-I) color of the
radio sources is redder than the median color of the whole optical sample.
These results suggest that radio detection is preferentially selecting galaxies
with higher intrinsic optical luminosity. From the analysis of the optical
properties of the radio sources as function of the radio flux, we found that
while about 35% of the radio sources are optically unidentified in the higher
radio flux bin (S> 1.0 mJy), the percentage of unidentified sources decreases
to about 25% in the faintest bins (S< 0.5 mJy). The median I magnitude for the
total sample of radio sources,i.e. including also the unidentified ones, is
brighter in the faintest radio bins than in the bin with higher radio flux.
This suggests that most of the faintest radio sources are likely to be
associated to relatively lower radio luminosity objects at relatively modest
redshift, rather than radio-powerful, AGN type objects at high redshift.

theories attempt to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe by
changing the theory of gravity, instead of introducing dark energy. In
particular, a class of models based on higher order curvature invariants,
so-called $f(R)$ gravity models, has drawn attention. In this letter we show
that within this framework, the expansion history of the universe does not
uniquely determine the form of the gravitational action and it can be radically
different from the standard Einstein-Hilbert action. We demonstrate that for
any barotropic fluid, there always exists a class of $f(R)$ models that will
have exactly the same expansion history as that arising from the
Einstein-Hilbert action. We explicitly show how one can extend the
Einstein-Hilbert action by constructing a $f(R)$ theory that is equivalent on
the classical level. Due to the classical equivalence between $f(R)$ theories
and Einstein-Hilbert gravity with an extra scalar field, one can also hence
construct equivalent scalar-tensor theories with standard expansion.

to a semiclassical analysis, the two level systems involve resonant collective
tunneling motions of around two hundred molecular units which are relics of the
mosaic of cooperative motions at the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The
density of states of the TLS is determined by $T_g$ and the mosaic's length
scale, which is a weak function of the cooling rate. The universality of phonon
scattering in insulating glasses is explained. The Boson Peak and the plateau
in thermal conductivity, observed at higher temperatures, are also
quantitatively understood within the picture as arising from the same
cooperative motions, but now accompanied by thermal activation of the mosaic's
vibrational modes. The dynamics of some of the local structural transitions
have significant quantum corrections to the semiclassical picture. These
corrections lead to a deviation of the heat capacity and conductivity from the
standard tunneling model results and explain the anomalous time dependence of
the heat capacity. Interaction between tunneling centers contributes to the
large and negative value of the Gr\""{u}neisen parameter often observed in
glasses.

In_0.6Ga_0.4As/GaAs quantum dots. By using an atomistic pseudopotential method
combined with the configuration-interaction method, we predict the following.
(i) The recombination energy of the lowest transition of X^- blue-shifts as
height increases, whereas that of X^+ red-shifts. Remarkably, the recombination
of XX^0 shows a red-shift at small heights, reaches a maximum shift, and then
blue-shifts for taller dots. (ii) Changes in dot height lead to a
bound-to-unbound crossover for X^-, X^+ and XX^0. (iii) When considering the
[110] and [1\bar{1}0] directions, the lowest transitions of X^0 and XX^0
manifest [110] vs [1\bar{1}0] in-plane polarization anisotropy that switches
sign as a function of height as well as alloy randomness. $X^-$ and $X^+$ show
transitions with negligible polarization anisotropy regardless of height. (iv)
The ground state of X^0 is split in a low-energy pair that is forbidden (dark)
and a high-energy pair that is allowed; thus, at T=0K the radiative lifetime
\tau(X^0) is long (~ ms) due to the dark exciton. On the other hand, at T=10K,
\tau(X^0) decreases moderately as height increases and its magnitude ranges
from 2-3ns. The ground state of X^- and X^+, and that of XX^0 is allowed
(bright); so, \tau(X^-), \tau(X^+) and \tau(XX^0) are fast (~ ns) even at T=0K.
These radiative lifetimes depend weakly on height. In addition, \tau(X^-) ~
\tau(X^+) ~1.1ns, while \tau(XX^0)~0.5ns$. We compare our predictions with

obtain an approximate analytic solution of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar
(DMPK) equation in the insulating regime of a metallic carbon nanotube with
symplectic symmetry and an odd number of conducting channels. This symmetry
class is characterized by the presence of a perfectly conducting channel in the
limit of infinite length of the nanotube. The derivation of the DMPK equation
for this system has recently been performed by Takane, who also obtained the
average conductance both analytically and numerically. Using the Jacobian
corresponding to the transformation to radial coordinates and the
parameterization of the transfer matrix given by Takane, we identify the
ensemble of transfer matrices as the symmetric space of negative curvature
SO^*(4m+2)/[SU(2m+1)xU(1)] belonging to the DIII-odd Cartan class. We rederive
the leading-order correction to the conductance of the perfectly conducting
channel <log(delta g)> and its variance Var(log(delta g)). Our results are in
complete agreement with Takane's. In addition, our approach based on the
mapping to a symmetric space enables us to obtain new universal quantities: a
universal group theoretical expression for the ratio Var(log(delta
g)/<log(delta g)> and as a byproduct, a novel expression for the localization
length for the most general case of a symmetric space with BC_m root system, in
which all three types of roots are present.

ramp junctions of several geometries. Macroscopically, tunneling occurs in the
ab-plane of YBCO either in the (100) and (010) direction, or in the (110)
direction. These junctions have a stable and macroscopically well defined
geometry. This allows systematic investigations of both quasiparticle and
Josephson tunneling over a wide range of temperature and magnetic field. With
Nb superconducting, its gap appears in the quasiparticle conductance spectra as
Nb coherence peaks and a dip at the center of a broadened zero-bias conductance
peak (ZBCP). As we increase the temperature or an applied magnetic field both
the Nb coherence peaks and the dip get suppressed and the ZBCP fully develops,
while states are conserved. With Nb in the normal state the ZBCP is observed up
to about 77 K and is almost unaffected by an increasing field up to 7 T. The
measurements are consistent with a convolution of density of states with
broadened Andreev bound states formed at the YBCO/Au/Nb junction interfaces.
Since junctions with different geometries are fabricated on the same substrate
under the same conditions one expects to extract reliable tunneling information
that is crystallographic direction sensitive. In high contrast to Josephson
tunneling, however, the quasiparticle conductance spectra are crystallographic
orientation insensitive: independent whether the tunneling occurs in the (100)
or (110) directions, a pronounced ZBCP is always observed, consistent with
microscopic roughness of the junction interfaces. Qualitatively, all these
particularities regarding quasiparticle spectra hold regardless whether the
YBCO thin film is twinned or untwinned.

fluctuations between near degenerate local configurations, which have nearly
frozen in at the glass transition. An estimate of the dipole's magnitude, based
on the random first order transition theory, is obtained and is found to be
consistent with experiment. The interaction between the dipoles is estimated
and is shown to contribute significantly to the Gr\""{u}neisen parameter anomaly
in low $T$ glasses. In completely amorphous media, the dipole moments are
expected to be modest in size despite their collective origin. In partially

from a unified point of view. The method is based on the analysis of the
diagrams directly in configuration space which, in the case of the sunrise-type
diagrams and diagrams related to them, leads to enormous simplifications as
compared to the traditional evaluation of loops in momentum space. We present
explicit formulae for their analytical evaluation for arbitrary mass
configurations and arbitrary dimensions at any loop order. We discuss several
limiting cases of their kinematical regimes which are e.g. relevant for
applications in HQET and NRQCD.

slow-roll inflation, we find that this gives a steeply varying probability
distribution for the normalization of the primordial density perturbations,
resulting in an exponentially small fraction of observers measuring the COBE
value of 10^-5. Inflationary landscapes should avoid this ""\sigma problem"", and
we explore features that can allow them to do that. One possibility is that,
prior to slow-roll inflation, the probability distribution for vacua is
extremely sharply peaked, selecting essentially a single anthropically allowed
vacuum. Such a selection could occur in theories of eternal inflation. A second
possibility is that the inflationary landscape has a special property: although
scanning leads to patches with volumes that differ exponentially, the value of
the density perturbation does not vary under this scanning. This second case is
preferred over the first, partly because a flat inflaton potential can result
from anthropic selection, and partly because the anthropic selection of a small
cosmological constant is more successful.

which is the central reason why a pseudoanalytic function and as a consequence
a spinor field depending on two space variables share many of the properties of
analytic functions. One of the surprising consequences of the established
relation with pseudoanalytic functions consists in the following result.
Consider the Dirac equation with a scalar potential depending on one variable
with fixed energy and mass. In general this equation cannot be solved
explicitly even if one looks for wave functions of one variable. Nevertheless
for such Dirac equation we obtain an algorithmically simple procedure for
constructing in explicit form a complete system of exact solutions (depending
on two variables). These solutions generalize the system of powers of z in
complex analysis and are called formal powers. With their aid any regular
solution of the Dirac equation can be represented by its Taylor series in
formal powers.

nice features. Not only it is big enough to contain all dihomotopy types, but
also a morphism between them is a weak dihomotopy equivalence if and only if it
is invertible up to dihomotopy. Thus, the category of cofibrant homotopy
continuous flows provides an implementation of Whitehead's theorem for the full
dihomotopy relation, and not only for S-homotopy as in previous works of the

cirquent calculus. While in Gentzen-style proof trees sibling (or cousin, etc.)
sequents are disjoint sequences of formulas, in cirquent calculus they are
permitted to share elements. Explicitly allowing or disallowing shared
resources and thus taking to a more subtle level the resource-awareness
intuitions underlying substructural logics, cirquent calculus offers much
greater flexibility and power than sequent calculus does. A need for
substantially new deductive tools came with the birth of computability logic
(see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html) - the semantically constructed
formal theory of computational resources, which has stubbornly resisted any
axiomatization attempts within the framework of traditional syntactic
approaches. Cirquent calculus breaks the ice. Removing contraction from the
full collection of its rules yields a sound and complete system for the basic
fragment CL5 of computability logic. Doing the same in sequent calculus, on the
other hand, throws out the baby with the bath water, resulting in the strictly
weaker affine logic. An implied claim of computability logic is that it is CL5
rather than affine logic that adequately materializes the resource philosophy
traditionally associated with the latter. To strengthen this claim, the paper
further introduces an abstract resource semantics and shows the soundness and
completeness of CL5 with respect to it.

  Densities are constructed as linear combinations of scaling homogeneous terms
with undetermined coefficients. The variational derivative (Euler operator) is
used to compute the undetermined coefficients. The homotopy operator is used to
compute the fluxes.
  The method is illustrated with nonlinear PDEs describing wave phenomena in
fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and quantum physics. For PDEs with parameters,
the method determines the conditions on the parameters so that a sequence of
conserved densities might exist. The existence of a large number of
conservation laws is a predictor for complete integrability. The method is
algorithmic, applicable to a variety of PDEs, and can be implemented in
computer algebra systems such as Mathematica, Maple, and REDUCE.

functions of velocity fluctuations in the entire boundary region, from the

a first approximation, we employ the traditional return-to-isotropy hypothesis,
which yields a very simple distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy between
the velocity components in the log-layer: the streamwise component contains a
half of the total energy whereas the wall-normal and the cross-stream
components contain a quarter each. In addition, the model predicts a very
simple relation between the von-K\'arm\'an slope $\kappa $ and the turbulent
velocity in the log-law region $v^+$ (in wall units): $v^+=6 \kappa$. These

on Higgs and smuon mass measurement are also estimated. Using fast Monte Carlo
simulations of the 2001 North American baseline detector designs (LD and SD),
we find that the ISR and beamstrahlung have significant impact on Higgs and
smuon mass measurement; Charged track momentum resolution affect Higgs mass
significantly with better track performance yielding better Higgs mass
resolution and precision for the track momentum resolution improvement up to a
factor of about 5; Track momentum resolution has little effect on the
measurement precision of the Higgsstrahlung cross section, the branching ratio
of $H \to C\bar{C}$, the smuon and neutralino masses; Beam energy spread better
than about 0.2% has little effect on Higgs, smuon and neutralino masses; The SD
detector provides a more accurate measurement than the LD of the Higgs mass.

exhibited by the presence of photonic crystals in a three-level system. An
analytic approach is proposed for any three-level system in the presence of
photonic band gap. Using this analytic solution, we conclusively calculate the
concurrence and phase entropy, focusing particularly on the entanglement
phenomena. Specifically, we use concurrence as a measure of entanglement for
dipole emitters situated in the thin slab region between two semi-infinite
one-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals, a situation reminiscent of planar
cavity laser structures. One feature of the regime considered here is that
closed-form evaluation of the time evolution may be carried out in the presence
of the detuning and the photonic band gap, which provides insight into the
difference in the nature of the concurrence function for atom-field coupling,
mode frequency and different cavity parameters. We demonstrate how fluctuations
in the phase and number entropies effected by the presence of the
photonic-band-gap. The outcomes are illustrated with numerical simulations
applied to GaAs. Finally, we relate the obtained results to instances of any
three-level system for which the entanglement cost can be calculated. Potential
experimental observations in solid-state systems are discussed and found to be
promising.

oscillators but rather with a whole bunch of them, i.e., where in contrast to
usually studied ""mathematical blocks"" not every possible measurement is
allowed. On the other, this formalism naturally allows the generalization to
blocks which may consist of several non-contiguous regions. We quantify
entanglement between the collective operators by a measure based on the
Peres-Horodecki criterion and show how it can be extracted and transferred to
two qubits. Entanglement between two blocks is found even in the case where
none of the oscillators from one block is entangled with an oscillator from the
