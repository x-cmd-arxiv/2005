will drift with a definite angle velocity around rotational pole due to the
rotation of neutron stars. This is called the nonradial oscillation node
precession of neutron stars. This article estimated the precession velocity and
pointed out that it merely lies on the star's rotation velocity and the angular
order of spherical harmonic $l$ by one order approximation. If we suppose that
oscillations effect the particles' escaping from the polar cap of a neutron
star, so that the antinode and node areas of the standing waves have different
radiative intensity, several unusual conclusions are acquired by reviewing the
observation of pulsars which had already been taken as neutron stars. For
example, the drifting subpulse period $P_{3}$ can be gotten from the width of
subpulses and order $l$; the larger velocity drift may produce the peak
structure of average pulse profiles; the dissimilar radiation phenomena between
neighboring periods generated from drift provide a reasonable explanation of
interpulses which have been found on some pulsars.

(redshifts 2.0 to 2.6), implied by their line widths, are too low for
collisional ionization to be a dominant process. We estimate the oxygen
abundance under the assumption of photoionization; a striking result is the
bimodal distribution of [O/H] with median values close to 0.01 (0.5) solar for
the metal-poor (metal-rich) populations. We present the first estimate of the
OVI column density distribution and fit a single power-law index of ~-1.7 and a
normalization of f(N)= 2.3e(-13) at log N(OVI) ~ 13.5, both with a ~30%
uncertainty. The value of the index is similar to that found for CIV surveys,
whereas the normalization factor is about ten times higher. We use f(N) to
derive dn/dz and the cosmic density, Omega_b(OVI), selecting a limited column
density range not strongly affected by incompleteness or sample variance. We
find some decline of dn/dz with z. The cosmic OVI density derived from f(N),
Omega_b(OVI) ~ 3.5e(-7), is 2.3 times higher than the value estimated using the
observed OVI sample (of which the metal-rich population contributes ~35%),
easing the problem of missing metals at high z (~1/4 of the produced metals)

located within ~450 km/s of strong Ly-a lines and show that, contrary to the
metal-poor absorbers, this population cannot be in hydrostatic equilibrium. All

metal-poor absorbers tracing the intergalactic medium and metal-rich absorbers
associated with active sites of star formation.

mean neutral hydrogen column density that is roughly constant at $N(HI) \approx
4 \times 10^{20}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, with individual systems lying in the damped

brightness profiles for the unresolved component flatten in the centres. They
can be fitted across the whole range of radii with a hyperbolic secant (sech)
defined as a function of two parameters: the central surface brightness and the
scale length of the exponential. Isophotal, total, and fitted sech magnitudes
have been calculated for all galaxies for which the unresolved component was
detected, along with semimajor axes. The scale length and the semimajor axes
correlate linearly with absolute isophotal magnitude. The same is true for
colors and the central brightness. More luminous dIs tend to be larger, redder
and brighter in the centre. The Tully-Fisher relation shows considerable
scatter, but residuals are tied to surface brightness. The galaxies appear to
lie in a ``fundamental plane'' defined by the sech absolute magnitude, the sech
central surface brightness, and the HI line-width. The rms of residuals in M_K
is only 0.4 mag, which implies that the plane can be used to evaluate the
distances of star-forming dwarfs. Color-magnitude diagrams are presented for 29

`miniquasars' powered by intermediate-mass black holes. We follow the
non-equilibrium multispecies chemistry of primordial gas in the presence of a
point source of X-ray radiation, which starts shining in a rare high-sigma peak
at z=21 and emits a power-law spectrum in the 0.2-10 keV range. We find that,
after one Salpeter time-scale, the miniquasar has heated up the simulation box
to a volume-averaged temperature of 2800 K. The mean electron and H2 fractions
are now 0.03 and 4e-5: the latter is 20 times larger than the primordial value,
and will delay the buildup of a uniform UV photodissociating background. The
net effect of the X-rays is to reduce gas clumping in the IGM by as much as a
factor of 3. While the suppression of baryonic infall lowers the gas mass
fraction at overdensities delta in the range 20-2000, enhanced molecular
cooling increases the amount of dense material at delta>2000. In many haloes
within the proximity of our miniquasar the H2-boosting effect of X-rays is too
weak to overcome heating, and the cold and dense gas mass actually decreases.
We find little evidence for an entropy floor in gas at intermediate densities
preventing gas contraction and H2 formation. Overall, the radiative feedback
from X-rays enhances gas cooling in lower-sigma peaks that are far away from
the initial site of star formation, thus decreasing the clustering bias of the
early pregalactic population, but does not appear to dramatically reverse or
promote the collapse of pregalactic clouds as a whole. (abridged)

panoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with Suprime-Cam as part of the
PISCES project. By combining with the SDSS data as a local counterpart for
comparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges in
environment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). We find that colours of
galaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($M_V>M_V^*+1$), change from blue
to red at a break density as we go to denser regions. Based on local and global
densities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, and
clusters. We show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already built
at $z=0.83$. In contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnitude
relation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and the
build-up at the faint-end has not started yet. A possible interpretation of
these results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. That is,
massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of star
formation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. This trend is
likely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnitude
relation is delayed in lower-density environments. Therefore, we may suggest
that the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and in
high density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lower
density regions.

suggestions that silicate emissions are present only in the most luminous AGN.
The silicate features may be signatures of a dusty ``obscuring torus'' viewed
face-on as postulated for Type 1 AGN. However, the apparently cool (~200 K)
dust is inconsistent with theoretical expectations of much hotter torus walls.
Furthermore, not all Type 1 objects are silicate emission sources.
Alternatively, the silicate emission may originate in dust not directly
associated with a torus. We find that the long-wavelength (>20 micron) tail of
the emission in NGC3998 is significantly weaker than in the sample of bright
QSOs recently presented by Hao et al. The 10 micron profile in our NGC3998

differences in the dust composition, grain size distribution, or degree of
crystallization. The differences between NGC3998, QSOs, and Galactic templates

increases for all considered dark energy models. On the regime where the
dominant energy condition is violated all such models predict a steady
decreasing of the linear energy density of the cosmic strings as phantom energy

process is a wiggleless defect. It is argued however that if accreation of
phantom energy would proceed by successive quantum steps then the defect would
continue losing linear energy density until a minimum nonzero value which can
be quite smaller than that corresponding to the unperturbed string.

sample of 123 X-ray sources (46 being type-1 AGN and 28 type-2 AGN) detected
with XMM-Newton in the Lockman Hole field. Using a single power law model our
sources' average spectral slope hardens at faint 0.5-2 keV fluxes but not at
faint 2-10 keV fluxes. We explain the effect in terms of an increase in X-ray
absorption at faint fluxes. The average spectral slope of our sources is ~1.9
with an intrinsic dispersion of ~0.28. We detected X-ray absorption in 37% of
the sources, ~10% in type-1 AGN and ~77% in type-2 AGN. Using X-ray fluxes
corrected for absorption, the fraction of absorbed objects and the absorbing
column density distribution did not vary with X-ray flux. Our type-1 and type-2
AGN do not appear to have different continuum shapes, but the distribution of
intrinsic absorption is different among both classes. A significant fraction of
our type-2 AGN (5 out of 28) were found to display no substantial absorption.
We discuss possible interpretations to this in terms of Compton-thick AGN and
intrinsic Broad Line Region properties. An emission line compatible with Fe
Kalpha was detected in 8 sources with rest frame equivalent widths 120-1000 eV.
The AGN continuum or intrinsic absorption did not depend on X-ray luminosity
and/or redshift. Soft excess emission was detected in 18 objects, but only in 9
could we fit this spectral component with a black body model. The 0.5-2 keV
luminosities of the fitted black body were not significantly different in

The underlying X-ray continuum is found to be typical of a broad-line active
galaxy, with photon index Gamma ~ 1.9. Low energy absorption can be modelled by
a column N_H ~ 10^22 cm^{-2} of moderately ionised gas or a smaller column of
cold gas. Addition of a soft X-ray emission component significantly improves
the fit in both cases. With the assumption that the soft X-ray flux represents
emission from gas photoionised by the incident X-ray continuum, a comparison of
the absorbed and emitted luminosities indicates a covering factor of ~ 8-17%.
The unusual opportunity to simultaneously observe and quantify ionised
absorption and emission in 2MASS 234449+1221 is due to the relatively large
opacity (for a Type 1 AGN) of the absorbing gas, which depresses the normally
strong continuum below ~ 1 keV. A comparison of the soft X-ray emission of

comparable redshifts. However, the equivalent widths of blazar lines are
significantly smaller than those of radio-loud quasars. Therefore, while the
intrinsic broad line region luminosity of blazars appears to be
indistinguishable from that of radio-loud quasars, their continuum must be
comparatively higher, most probably due to relativistic beaming. We have
combined the UV luminosities of the de-beamed continuum with the emitting gas
velocity to derive estimates of the masses of the central supermassive black
holes. The size of the broad line region was computed in two ways: 1) via an
empirical relationship between UV continuum luminosity and broad line region
size, and 2) through the external photon density required by blazar models to
reproduce the inverse Compton components observed at gamma-rays. The second
method yields significantly different results from the first method, suggesting
that it provides only a very rough estimate or a lower limit on the size of the
broad line region. We find that the average mass of the central black holes in
blazars is ~2.8e8 Msun, with a large dispersion, comparable to those computed
for other radio-loud active galactic nuclei.

confirms that sources lying above the main stellar locus in the (r' - Halpha,

thermal annealing was analysed by electrical and structural measurements on
field-effect transistors (FETs) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) diodes
using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a semiconducting polymer and Si/SiO2
wafers as a substrate. It is found that surface treatment using silanising
agents like hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and octadecyltrichlorosi-lane (OTS) can
increase the field-effect mobility by up to a factor of 50, reaching values in
saturation of more than 4E-2 cm^2/Vs at room temperature. While there is a
clear correlation between the obtained field-effect mobility and the contact
angle of water on the treated substrates, X-ray diffraction and capacitance
measurements on MIS diodes show that structural and electrical properties in
the bulk of the P3HT films are not influenced by the surface treatment. On the
other hand, thermal annealing is found to cause an increase of grain size, bulk
relaxation frequency and thereby of the mobility perpendicular to the SiO2/P3HT
interface, but has very little influence on the field-effect mobility.
Temperature dependent investigations on MIS diodes and FETs show that the
transport perpendicular to the substrate plane is thermally activated and can
be described by hopping in a Gaussian density of states, whereas the
field-effect mobility in the substrate plane is almost temperature independent
over a wide range. This investigations reveal significant differ-ences between
interface and bulk transport properties in polymer field-effect devices.

heterostructures, based on a unified semiclassical description of ballistic and
diffusive transport in semiconductor structures, is developed. The aim is to
provide a framework for studying the interplay of spin relaxation and transport
mechanism in spintronic devices. A key element of the unified description of
transport inside a (nondegenerate) semiconductor is the thermoballistic current
consisting of electrons which move ballistically in the electric field arising
from internal and external electrostatic potentials, and which are thermalized
at randomly distributed equilibration points. The ballistic component in the
unified description gives rise to discontinuities in the chemical potential at
the boundaries of the semiconductor, which are related to the Sharvin interface
conductance. By allowing spin relaxation to occur during the ballistic motion
between the equilibration points, a thermoballistic spin-polarized current and
density are constructed in terms of a spin transport function. An integral
equation for this function is derived for arbitrary values of the momentum and
spin relaxation lengths. For field-driven transport in a homogeneous
semiconductor, the integral equation can be converted into a second-order
differential equation that generalizes the standard spin drift-diffusion
equation. The spin polarization in ferromagnet/semiconductor heterostructures
is obtained by invoking continuity of the current spin polarization and
matching the spin-resolved chemical potentials on the ferromagnet sides of the
interfaces. Allowance is made for spin-selective interface resistances.
Examples are considered which illustrate the effects of transport mechanism and
electric field.

corresponding to a thickening of this antichain containing non-trivial
geometric and topological information. We find that covariant observables can
be associated with such thickened antichains and transitions between them, in
classical stochastic growth models of causal sets. This construction highlights
the difference between the covariant measure on causal set cosmology and the
standard sum-over-histories approach: the measure is assigned to completed
histories rather than to histories on a restricted spacetime region. The
resulting re-phrasing of the sum-over-histories may be fruitful in other

during 1991-1995 is analysed in order to measure the $\tau$ decay branching
fractions. Extensive systematic studies are performed, in order to match the
large statistics of the data sample corresponding to over 300 000 measured and
identified $\tau$ decays. Branching fractions are obtained for the two leptonic
channels and eleven hadronic channels defined by their respective numbers of
charged particles and $\pi^0$'s. Using previously published ALEPH results on
final states with charged and neutral kaons, corrections are applied to the
hadronic channels to derive branching ratios for exclusive final states without
kaons. Thus the analyses of the full LEP-1 ALEPH data are combined to yield a
complete description of $\tau$ decays, encompassing 22 non-strange and 11
strange hadronic modes. Some physics implications of the results are given, in
particular related to universality in the leptonic charged weak current,
isospin invariance in $a_1$ decays, and the separation of vector and
axial-vector components of the total hadronic rate. Finally, spectral functions
are determined for the dominant hadronic modes and updates are given for
several analyses. These include: tests of isospin invariance between the weak
charged and electromagnetic hadronic currents, fits of the $\rho$ resonance
lineshape, and a QCD analysis of the nonstrange hadronic decays using spectral
moments, yielding the value $\alpha_s(m^2_\tau) = 0.340 \pm 0.005_{\rm exp} \pm
0.014_{\rm th}$. The evolution to the $Z$ mass scale yields $\alpha_s(M_Z^2) =
0.1209 \pm 0.0018$. This value agrees well with the direct determination from
the $Z$ width and provides the most accurate test to date of asymptotic freedom
in the QCD gauge theory.

from tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing, corrected by charged lepton mixing angles
which are related to quark mixing angles via quark-lepton unification. The
tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can naturally originate from the see-saw
mechanism via constrained sequential dominance (CSD), where CSD can result from
the vacuum alignment of a non-Abelian family symmetry such as SO(3). We
construct a realistic model of quark and lepton masses and mixings based on
SO(3) family symmetry with quark-lepton unification based on the Pati-Salam
gauge group. The atmospheric angle is predicted to be approximately maximal
$\theta_{23}= 45^\circ$, corrected by the quark mixing angle
$\theta_{23}^{\mathrm{CKM}}\approx 2.4^\circ$, with the correction controlled
by an undetermined phase in the quark sector. The solar angle is predicted by
the tri-bimaximal complementarity relation: $\theta_{12}+
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\theta_{\mathrm{C}}}{3} \cos (\delta - \pi) \approx
35.26^\circ $, where $\theta_{\mathrm{C}}$ is the Cabibbo angle and $\delta$ is
the neutrino oscillation phase. The reactor angle is predicted to be
$\theta_{13} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\theta_{\mathrm{C}}}{3}\approx
3.06^\circ$. The MNS neutrino oscillation phase $\delta$ is predicted in terms
of the solar angle to be $\cos (\delta - \pi) \approx (35.26^\circ -
\theta_{12}^\circ)/3.06^\circ $. These predictions can all be tested by future
high precision neutrino oscillation experiments, thereby probing the nature of
high energy quark-lepton unification.

This effect increases as the reaction becomes more peripheral. The development
of both components of the anisotropic flow is closely related to particle
freeze-out. Hadrons are emitted continuously, and different hadronic species
are decoupled from the system at different times. These hadrons contribute
differently to the formation and evolution of the elliptic flow, which can be
decomposed onto three components: (i) flow created by hadrons emitted from the
surface at the onset of the collision; (ii) flow produced by jets; (iii)
hydrodynamic flow. Due to these features, the general trend in elliptic flow
formation is that the earlier mesons are frozen, the weaker their elliptic
flow. In contrast, baryons frozen at the end of the system evolution have
stronger v2.

functions. At leading logarithmic level, and in single-inclusive cross
sections, only two-point functions of Wilson lines in the adjoint and
fundamental representations (Mueller's dipoles) arise, which can be obtained
from the solution of the JIMWLK equations. The application of our results to
forward-rapidity production at RHIC energy shows that, in general, recoil

different from the central region at LHC, despite comparable gluon densities in
the target. We show that both the quantum x-evolution of the high-density

additional strong evidence for the Color Glass Condensate at RHIC.

generally jumps by the class of the vanishing cycle. To decide which classical

dressed (in the sense that itself constitutes an horizon). The space-time
curvatures can be both positive or negative depending on the dominance of the
scalar or topologically massive matter. The Chern-Simons term is responsible
for interesting features, besides only allowing for rotating solutions, it
imposes restrictive bounds on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ such that it
belongs to a positive interval and is switch on and off by the topological mass
$m^2$. Furthermore the charge, angular momentum and mass of the particle
solution are expressed uniquely as functions of the ratio between the
cosmological constant and the topological mass squared $x=\Lambda/m^2$. The
main drawback of our particle solution is that the mass is divergent. Our
background is a rotating flat space without angular deficit. We briefly discuss

Thus, for

this fact, including constructive proofs, but there has been little attention
to the complexity of the 4-manifold produced. Given a 3-manifold M of
complexity n, we show how to construct a 4-manifold bounded by M of complexity
O(n^2). Here we measure ``complexity'' of a piecewise-linear manifold by the
minimum number of n-simplices in a triangulation. It is an open question
whether this quadratic bound can be replaced by a linear bound.
  The proof goes through the notion of ""shadow complexity"" of a 3-manifold M. A
shadow of M is a well-behaved 2-dimensional spine of a 4-manifold bounded by M.
We prove that, for a manifold M satisfying the Geometrization Conjecture with
Gromov norm G and shadow complexity S, c_1 G <= S <= c_2 G^2 for suitable
constants c_1, c_2. In particular, the manifolds with shadow complexity 0 are
the graph manifolds.

that, if such objects indeed exist, then, in heavy ion collisions, the
single-$K^-$ clusters are most abundantly produced at present SIS energies,
while the double-$K^-$ clusters show a pronounced maximum yield in the energy
domain of the future accelerator at GSI. This is a direct consequence of: i)
the baryonic dominance in low energy heavy ion collisions and the large
baryonic content of the antikaonic bound states; ii) the strong energy
dependence of strangeness production at low energies.
  The production yields of double-strange clusters is compared with that of
double strange baryons. It is shown that at SIS energy there is a linear
scaling relation of the $\Xi^-/K^+$ with $K^+/p$ yields ratio.

order to maximize the packets handling capacity of underlying structure that

investigating the distributions of queue length on each node in free state, we
give an explanation why the delivering capacity of the network can be enhanced

the critical point are also studied. Interestingly, it is found that although
the system enters the congestion state, it still possesses partial delivering
capability which do not depend on $\alpha$. This phenomenon suggests that the
capacity of the network can be enhanced by increasing the forwarding ability of
small important nodes which bear severe congestion.

automaton (TCA) model (i.e., the stochastic TCA model of Nagel and
Schreckenberg) and the macroscopic first-order hydrodynamic model of Lighthill,
Whitham, and Richards (LWR). The innovative aspect of our approach, is that we
explicitly derive the LWR's fundamental diagram directly from the STCA's rule
set, by assuming a stationarity condition that converts the STCA's rules into a
set of linear inequalities. In turn, these constraints define the shape of the
fundamental diagram, which is then specified to the LWR model. Application of
our methodology to a simulation case study, allows us to compare the
tempo-spatial behavior of both models. Our results indicate that, in the
presence of noise, the capacity flows in the derived fundamental diagram are
overestimations of those of the STCA model. Directly specifying the STCA's
capacity flows to the LWR fundamental diagram, effectively remedies most of the
mismatches between both approaches. Our methodology sees the STCA complementary
to the LWR model and vice versa, so the results can be of great assistance when
interpreting the traffic dynamics in both models. Especially appealing, is the
fact that the STCA can visualize the higher-order characteristics of traffic
stream dynamics, e.g., the fans of rarefaction waves.

contemporary wars and their relationship to older conventional and terrorist
wars, both of which exhibit remarkable regularities. The frequency-intensity
distribution of fatalities in ""old wars"", 1816-1980, is a power-law with
exponent 1.80. Global terrorist attacks, 1968-present, also follow a power-law
with exponent 1.71 for G7 countries and 2.5 for non-G7 countries. Here we
analyze two ongoing, high-profile wars on opposite sides of the globe -
Colombia and Iraq. Our analysis uses our own unique dataset for killings and
injuries in Colombia, plus publicly available data for civilians killed in
Iraq. We show strong evidence for power-law behavior within each war. Despite
substantial differences in contexts and data coverage, the power-law
coefficients for both wars are tending toward 2.5, which is a value
characteristic of non-G7 terrorism as opposed to old wars. We propose a
plausible yet analytically-solvable model of modern insurgent warfare, which
can explain these observations.

geometric, conditions like cylindricity are not geometric. This problem was
partly solved by Einstein and Bergman who proposed, in their 1938 paper, that
the 5th dimension is compactified into a small circle $S^1$ so that in the
resulting cylindric 5D space-time $R^4\times S^1$ the dependence on $x^5$ is

general not straightforwardly be generalized to relativistic wave equations.
The problems which prevent us from devising a pilot-wave interpretation for
relativistic wave equations also plague the standard quantum mechanical
interpretation, where these problems led to the conception of quantum field
theory. Therefore most of our attention is focussed on the construction of a
pilot-wave interpretation for quantum field theory. We thereby favour the field
beable approach, developed amongst others by Bohm, Hiley, Holland, Kaloyerou
