of type Ic supernova SN 2004gt, using the newly commissioned Keck laser-guide
star adaptive optics system (LGSAO) along with archival Hubble Space Telescope
data. This is the deepest search yet performed for the progenitor of any type
Ib/c event in a wide wavelength range stretching from the far UV to the near
IR. We determine that the progenitor of SN 2004gt was most likely less luminous
than M_V=-5.5 and M_B=-6.5 magnitudes. The massive stars exploding as
hydrogen-deficient core-collapse supernovae (SNe) should have lost their outer
hydrogen envelopes prior to their explosion, either through winds -- such stars
are identified within our Galaxy as Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars -- or to a binary
companion. The luminosity limits we set rule out more than half of the known
galactic W-R stars as possible progenitors of this event. In particular, they
imply that a W-R progenitor should have been among the more-evolved (highly
stripped, less luminous) of these stars, a concrete constraint on its
evolutionary state just prior to core collapse. The possibility of a less
luminous, lower-mass binary progenitor cannot be constrained. This study
demonstrates the power of LGS observations in furthering our understanding of
core collapse, and the physics powering supernovae, GRBs and XRFs.

interpretive challenges still posed by the observations. In the high state, the
FUV spectra are dominated by disk emission that is modified by scattering in
high and low velocity material located above the disk photosphere. Progress is
being made toward reproducing the high-state spectra using kinematic
prescriptions of the velocity field and new ionization and radiative transfer
codes. In conjunction with hydrodynamical simulations of the outflows, accurate
estimates of the mass loss rates and determination of the launching mechanism
are likely forthcoming. In quiescence, the FUV spectra reveal contributions
from the WD and the disk. Quantitative analyses have lead to solid measurements
of the temperatures and abundances of a number of WDs in CVs, and of a
determination of the response of the WD to an outburst. Basic challenges exist
in terms of understanding the other components of the emission in quiescence,
however, and these are needed to better understand the structure of the disk
and the physical mechanisms resulting in ongoing accretion in quiescence.

34 days, and the eccentricity is nearly 0.3. The importance of such a discovery
is that it can be used to help calibrate evolutionary models at low masses and
young ages. This is one of the outstanding problems in the study of formation
mechanisms and initial mass functions at low masses. The orbit allows us to
place a lower limit of 0.64 +- 0.02 M_sol on the total system mass. The

To determine the spatial distribution of methyl isocyanide, we used archival
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array data for the J(K)=4(K)-3(K)

the bonding energy difference between the cyanide and isocyanide molecules is
>8500 cm^-1 (>12,000 K). That we detect methyl isocyanide emission with a
single antenna (Gaussian beamsize(Omega_B)=1723 arcsec^2) but not with an
interferometer (Omega_B=192 arcsec^2), strongly suggests that methyl isocyanide
has a widespread spatial distribution toward the Sgr B2(N) region. Thus,
large-scale, non-thermal processes in the surrounding medium may account for
the conversion of methyl cyanide to methyl isocyanide while the LMH hot core,
which is dominated by thermal processes, does not produce a significant amount
of methyl isocyanide. Ice analog experiments by other investigators have shown
that radiation bombardment of methyl cyanide can produce methyl isocyanide,
thus supporting our observations. We conclude that isomers separated by such

the global X-ray properties of the stellar population associated with the Orion
Nebula. Three components contribute roughly equally to the integrated COUP
luminosity in the hard (2-8 keV) X-ray band: several OB stars, 822 lightly
obscured cool stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and 559 heavily obscured
stars. ONC stars 0.5-2 pc from the center show a spatial asymmetry consistent
with violent relaxation in the stellar dynamics. The obscured COUP sources
concentrate around both OMC-1 molecular cores; these small-scale structures
indicate ages t < 0.1 Myr. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the lightly
obscured sample is roughly lognormal in shape. The obscured population is
deficient in lower-luminosity stars, perhaps due to localized circumstellar
material. Mass-stratified XLFs show that one-third of the Orion Nebula region
hard-band emission is produced by the bright O6 star theta-1 Ori C and half is
produced by lower mass pre-main sequence stars with masses 0.3 < M < 3 Mo. Very
low mass stars contribute little to the cluster X-ray emission.
  Using the hard band emission, we show that young stellar clusters like the
ONC can be readily detected and resolved with Chandra across the Galactic disk,
even in the presence of heavy obscuration. The Orion Nebula sample is a
valuable template for studies of distant clusters. For example, the peak of the
XLF shape can serve as a standard candle for a new distance measure to distant
young stellar clusters, and the presence of a neon emission line complex around
1 keV can serve as a diagnostic for young stars.

flux tubes to a recent model of non-WKB Alfven wave reflection and turbulent
heating, and we predict coronal heating rates as a function of flux tube

Parker-type critical points, and we discuss the ranges of parameters that yield
a realistic bifurcation of wind solutions into fast and slow. Finally, we
discuss the need for next-generation coronagraph spectroscopy of the extended
corona - especially measurements of the electron temperature above 1.5 solar
radii - in order to confirm and refine these ideas.

provided new insights into the roles of shock waves, reconnection, and magnetic

additional ions with a wider sampling of charge/mass combinations. This would

observations taken over the course of a year reveal strong spectral evolution
as the source fades from outburst. The origin of this is traced to the
individual decay rates of the pulsar's spectral components. A 2-T fit at each
epoch requires nearly constant temperatures of kT=0.25 & 0.67 keV while the
component luminosities decrease exponentially with tau=900 & 300d,
respectively. One possible interpretation is that the slowly decaying cooler
component is the radiation from a deep heating event that affected a large
fraction of the crust, while the hotter component is powered by external
surface heating at the foot-points of twisted magnetic field lines, by
magnetospheric currents that are decaying more rapidly. The energy-dependent
pulse profile of XTE J1810-197 is well modeled at all epochs by the sum of a
sine and triangle function. These profiles peak at the same phase, suggesting a
concentric surface emission geometry. The spectral and pulse evolution together
argue against the presence of a significant ``power-law'' contribution to the

tidal fields suppress the formation of low-mass haloes while promoting that of
pancakes, the formation of massive pancakes precedes that of the low-mass

matter haloes with M<10^{12}h^{-1}\msun were embedded in pancakes of masses
$~5x10^{12}h^{-1}\msun$ at z~2. The formation of such pancakes heats the gas to

We investigate the effects of survey edges, redshift precision, redshift-space

line-of-sight galaxy distribution irretrievably on small scales; this
significantly limits the application of photometric redshift surveys to
environment studies. Edges and holes in a survey field dramatically affect the
estimation of environment, with the impact of edge effects depending upon the
adopted environment measure. These edge effects considerably limit the
usefulness of smaller survey fields (e.g. the GOODS fields) for studies of
galaxy environment. In even the poorest groups and clusters, redshift-space
distortions limit the effectiveness of each environment statistic; measuring
density in projection (e.g. using counts in a cylindrical aperture or a

exhibits a young age of ~4 Gyr and a metallicity ~3 times solar. At one
effective radius the age has risen to ~12 Gyr and the metallicity fallen to
less than 1/3 solar. The low metallicity population around one effective radius

of late-type stars with suppressed magnetic activity. All TTS with known
rotation periods lie in the saturated or super-saturated regime of the relation
between activity and Rossby numbers seen for main-sequence (MS) stars, but the
TTS show a much larger scatter in X-ray activity than seen for the MS stars.
Strong near-linear relations between X-ray luminosities, bolometric
luminosities and mass are present. We also find that the fractional X-ray
luminosity rises slowly with mass over the 0.1 - 2 M_sun range. The plasma
temperatures determined from the X-ray spectra of the TTS are much hotter than
in MS stars, but seem to follow a general solar-stellar correlation between
plasma temperature and activity level. The large scatter about the relations
between X-ray activity and stellar parameters seems to be related to the
influence of accretion on the X-ray emission. While the X-ray activity of the
non-accreting TTS is consistent with that of rapidly rotating MS stars, the
accreting stars are less X-ray active (by a factor of ~2-3 on average) and
produce much less well defined correlations than the non-accretors. We discuss

tangential to the discontinuity and orthogonal to the flow velocity. The wave
pattern produced after the break up of the initial discontinuity is analogous
to the non--magnetic case and we show that the problem can be understood as a

The new degree of freedom introduced by the non-zero component of the magnetic
field results in interesting effects consisting in the change of the wave
patterns for given initial thermodynamical states, in a similar way to the
effects arising from the introduction of tangential velocities. Secondly, when
the magnetic field dominates the thermodynamical pressure and energy, the wave
speeds approach the speed of light leading to fast shocks and fast and

only one solution with realistic density profile, which occurs only for a
critical value of alpha_crit = 35/18 ~= 1.94, which is consistent with the
empirical value of 1.9+/-0.05. We extend our analysis in two ways: first we
introduce a parameter epsilon to allow for a more general relation
rho/\sigma_r^epsilon propto r^-alpha; second we consider velocity anisotropy.
If we assume beta(r) := 1- sigma_theta^2 / sigma_r^2 to be linearly related to
the logarithmic density slope gamma(r) := -dln(rho)/dln(r), which is in
agreement with simulations, the problem remains analytically tractable and is
equivalent to the simpler isotropic case: there exists only one physical
solution, which occurs at a critical alpha value. Remarkably, this value of
alpha and the density and velocity-dispersion profiles depend only on epsilon
and the value beta_0 := beta(r=0), but not on the slope of the linear
beta-gamma relation. For epsilon=3, alpha_crit = 35/18 - 2beta_0/9 and the
resulting density profile is fully analytic (as are the velocity dispersion and
circular speed) with an inner cusp rho propto r^{-(7+10beta_0)/9} and a very
smooth transition to a steeper outer power-law asymptote. These models are in
excellent agreement with the density, velocity-dispersion and anisotropy
profiles of simulated dark-matter haloes over their full resolved radial range.

the environment, passive galaxies dominate in bright samples and active-SF
galaxies in faint samples, whereas quiet-SF galaxies never dominate. We further
show that in bright samples (M$_{B}$ -- 5 $\log$ $h_{75}$ $\leq$$
  - 19$) the fraction of passive galaxies grows steadily with fainter neighbour
density, whereas in faint samples a threshold like dependence is observed. This
suggests that the spectral-type / density ($\approx$ morphology / density)
relation extends to intermediate dense environment, but only in the surrounding
of luminous galaxies and that it reflects an enhancement of the number of
satellites rather than stronger clustering among galaxies themselves. Our
analysis indicates that, in general, luminosity is a good tracer of a galaxy
halo mass and that it dominates over environment (satellite density) in setting
the spectral type mix of a population. However, minority populations exist,
such as luminous SF galaxies and faint passive galaxies, whose luminosity is an
unfair tracer of halo mass.

aimed at testing the hypothesis that dark halo triaxiality might induce
non-circular motions resulting in rotation curves best fitted by cored halos,
even if the dark matter halo is intrinsically cuspy. This hypothesis could be
invoked in order to reconcile the predictions of the standard LambdaCDM theory
with the rotation curves of disk galaxies. DDO 47 is an ideal case to test this
hypothesis because it has a very regular velocity field, its rotation curve is
best fitted by a cored halo and a NFW halo is inconsistent with the data. We
analysed the velocity field through the higher-order harmonic terms in order to
search for kinematical signatures of alleged non-circular motions needed to
""hide"" a cusp: the result is that globally non-circular motions are at a level
of 2-3 km/s, and they are more likely to be associated to the presence of some
spiral structure than to a global elongated potential (e.g. a triaxial halo).
These non-circular motions are far from being sufficient to account for the
discrepancy with the LambdaCDM predictions. We therefore conclude that the dark
matter halo around the dwarf galaxy DDO 47 is truly cored and that a cusp
cannot be hidden by non-circular motions.

abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full
range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively
star-forming galaxies. We show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of
increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000AA-break
strength (D4000). For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption
at fixed D4000 is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We
investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar
mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies
old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the
stellar mass range 3x10^9<M/Msun<3x10^10. Both high- and low-concentration
galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar
metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of
intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar
metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase
oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. [abriged]

maximum value (4.5 K) after about 260 h. Then Tc drops drastically, becoming
non-superconducting approximately 100 h later. Corresponding time-dependent
neutron powder diffraction data shows that the changes in superconductivity
exhibited by the metastable cobaltate correspond to slow formation of oxygen
vacancies in the CoO2 layers. In effect, the formation of these defects
continually reduces the cobalt oxidation state causing the sample to evolve
through its superconducting life cycle. Thus, the dome-shaped superconducting
phase diagram is mapped as a function of cobalt oxidation state using a single
sample. The width of this dome based on the formal oxidation state of cobalt is
very narrow - approximately 0.1 valence units wide. Interestingly, the maximum
Tc in NaxCoO2*yH2O occurs when the cobalt oxidation state is near 3.5. Thus, we
speculate that the maximum Tc occurs near the charge ordered insulating state
that correlates with the average cobalt oxidation state of 3.5.

electron-accepting orbitals which interact with an intramolecular vibration. We
investigate the interplay between Coulomb blockade and non-equilibrium
vibration-assisted tunneling under the following assumptions: (i) The Coulomb
charging effect restricts the number of extra electrons to one. (ii) The
orbitals are non-degenerate and couple asymmetrically to the vibration. (iii)
The tunneling induces a non-equilibrium vibrational distribution; we compare
with the opposite limit of strong relaxation of the vibration due to some
dissipative environment. We find that a non-equilibrium feedback mechanism in
the tunneling transitions generates strong negative differential conductance
(NDC) in the model with two competing orbitals, whereas in a one-orbital model
it leads only to weak NDC. In addition, we find another mechanism leading to
weak NDC over a broader range of applied voltages. This pervasive effect is
completely robust against strong relaxation of the vibrational energy.
Importantly, the modulation of the electronic transport is based on an
intramolecular asymmetry. We show that one can infer a non-equilibrium
vibrational distribution when finding NDC under distinct gate- and bias-voltage
conditions. In contrast, we demonstrate that any NDC effect in the one-orbital
case is completely suppressed in the strong relaxation limit.

consider inelastic one- and two-phonon scattering between different exciton
states (energy-relaxation-induced dephasing), as well as elastic two-phonon
scattering of the excitons (pure dephasing). The exciton states follow from
numerical diagonalization of a Frenkel Hamiltonian with diagonal disorder; the
scattering rates between them are obtained using the Fermi Golden Rule. A
Debye-like model for the one- and two-phonon spectral densities is used in the
calculations. We find that, owing to the disorder, the dephasing rates of the
individual exciton states are distributed over a wide range of values. We also
demonstrate that the dominant channel of two-phonon scattering is not the
elastic one, as is often tacitly assumed, but rather comes from a similar
two-phonon inelastic scattering process. In order to study the temperature
dependence of the J-band width, we simulate the absorption spectrum, accounting
for the dephasing induced broadening of the exciton states. We find a power-law
(T^p) temperature scaling of the effective homogeneous width, with an exponent
p that depends on the shape of the spectral density of host vibrations. In
particular, for a Debye model of vibrations, we find p ~ 4, which is in good

to analyze all the possible collective modes in this mean field state. In the
static (Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer) limit justified in the weak coupling regime,
we obtain the effective superconducting interaction between the doped holes at
the small pockets located around $\bm{k}= (\pm \pi/2, \pm \pi/2)$. In contrast
to the spin-bag theory, which takes into acccount only the antiferromagnetic
order, this effective force is pair breaking for the pairing without the nodes
in each of the small hole pocket, and is canceled out to be very small for the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing with nodes which is realized in the real cuprates.
Therefore we conclude that no superconducting instability can occur when only
the magnetic mechanism is considered. The relations of our work with other
approaches are also discussed.

dimensions. Its lift to M-theory, as well as its Einstein frame metric, are
singular in the sense that the geometry is geodesically incomplete and the
Riemann tensor diverges along a light-like subspace of codimension one. We
study this background as a model for a big bang type singularity in string
theory/M-theory. We construct the dual Matrix theory description in terms of a
(1+1)-d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a time-dependent world-sheet given
by the Milne orbifold of (1+1)-d Minkowski space. Our model provides a
framework in which the physics of the singularity appears to be under control.

particles and the low-temperature graviton background exists, the basic
cosmological conjecture about the Dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false.
In this case, a full magnitude of cosmological redshift would be caused by
interactions of photons with gravitons. A new dimensional constant which
characterizes one act of interaction is introduced and estimated. Non-forehead
collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional relaxation of
any photonic flux. It gives a possibility of another interpretation of
supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. Of course, all of these facts may
implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm. Some
features of a new paradigm are discussed here, too. A quantum mechanism of
classical gravity based on an existence of this sea of gravitons is described
for the Newtonian limit. This mechanism needs graviton pairing and ""an atomic
structure"" of matter for working it, and leads to the time asymmetry. If the
considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the nature,
than an existence of black holes contradicts to Einstein's equivalence
principle. It is shown that in this approach the two fundamental constants -
Hubble's and Newton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The
theoretical value of the Hubble constant is computed. In this approach, every
massive body would be decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be
connected with the Pioneer 10 anomaly. It is shown that the predicted and
observed values of deceleration are in good agreement. Some unsolved problems
are discussed, so as possibilities to verify some conjectures in laser-based
experiments.

problems with a unique solution. These problems are in general ill-posed.
Evaluation of the objective function is often expensive, as it implies the
solution of a non-trivial forward problem. The ill-posedness of these problems
calls for regularization while the high evaluation cost of the objective
function can be addressed with response surface techniques. The global
optimization using Radial Basis Function (RBF) as presented by Gutmann (2001)
is a response surface global optimization technique with regularizing aspects.
Alternatively, several publications put forward global optimization using a
probabilistic approach based upon Kriging as an efficient technique for
non-linear multi modal objective functions, thereby providing a credible
stopping rule (Jones2001). After comparing both concepts, we argue that in case
of non-linear inverse problems an adaptation of the RBF algorithm seems to be
the most promising approach.

semiclassicalisation of differential structures. The quantisations are induced

technique to solve initial-value problems involving nonlinear differential
equations. These methods seem particularly useful to the study of chaos since
no analytical chaotic solution is currently available. Using the well-known
Lorenz equations as an example, it is demonstrated that numerically computed
results and their associated statistical properties are time-step dependent.
There are two reasons for this behavior. First, chaotic differential equations
are unstable so that any small error is amplified exponentially near an
unstable manifold. The more serious and lesser-known reason is that stable and
unstable manifolds of singular points associated with differential equations
can form virtual separatrices. The existence of a virtual separatrix presents
the possibility of a computed trajectory actually jumping through it due to the
finite time-steps of discrete numerical methods. Such behavior violates the
uniqueness theory of differential equations and amplifies the numerical errors
explosively. These reasons imply that, even if computed results are bounded,
their independence on time-step should be established before accepting them as
useful numerical approximations to the true solution of the differential
equations. However, due to these exponential and explosive amplifications of
numerical errors, no computed chaotic solutions of differential equations
independent of integration-time step have been found. Thus, reports of computed
non-periodic solutions of chaotic differential equations are simply
consequences of unstably amplified truncation errors, and are not approximate
solutions of the associated differential equations.

previously in research involving the Navier-Stokes equations, are studied
within the framework of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation,
a model nonlinear partial-differential equation. This alternative approach is
expected to more easily expose major points and hopefully identify open
questions that are related to the Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, four
interesting issues are discussed. The first is related to the difficulty in
defining regions of linear stability and instability for a time-dependent
governing parameter; this is equivalent to a time-dependent base flow for the
Navier-Stokes equations. The next two issues are consequences of nonlinear
interactions. These include the evolution of the solution by exciting its
harmonics or sub-harmonics (Fourier components) simultaneously in the presence
of a constant or a time-dependent governing parameter; and the sensitivity of
the long-time solution to initial conditions. The final issue is concerned with
the lack of convergent numerical chaotic solutions, an issue that has not been
previously studied for the Navier-Stokes equations. The last two issues,
consequences of nonlinear interactions, are not commonly known. Conclusions and
questions uncovered by the numerical results are discussed. The reasons behind
each issue are provided with the expectation that they will stimulate interest

Lysines in their proteomes than of comparable in size and similarly charged
Arginines.. Consistent with that, high-throughput comparative analysis of
complete proteomes shows extremely strong bias towards Arginine-to-Lysine
replacement in hyperthermophilic organisms and overall much greater content of
Lysines than Arginines in hyperthermophiles. This finding cannot be explained
by GC compositional biases. Our study provides an example of how analysis of a
delicate physical mechanism of thermostability helps to resolve a puzzle in
comparative genomics as to why aminoacid compositions of hyperthermophilic
proteomes are significantly biased towards Lysines but not Arginines

due to a nonequilibrium biochemical reaction cycle of proteins near the

evolution occurs on very different length and time scales. Self-assembly
produces periodic protein patterns on a spatial scale below 0.1 micron in a few
seconds followed by extremely slow coarsening, whereas self-organization
results in a pattern wavelength comparable to the typical cell size of 100
micron within a few minutes suggesting different biological functions for the
two processes.

reality requires an unambiguous specification of the ensemble of realizable
states (and each state's probability of realization). Although not yet achieved
within the framework of standard quantum theory, it has been achieved within
the framework of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function
collapse model. In this paper, I consider a previously presented model, which
is predictively equivalent to CSL. In this Completely Quantized Collapse (CQC)
model, the classical random field which causes collapse in CSL is quantized.
The ensemble of realizable states is described by a single state vector, the
""ensemble vector,"" the sum of the direct product of an eigenstate of the
quantized field and the CSL state corresponding to that eigenstate. Using this
description, a long standing problem is resolved: it is shown how to define
energy of the random field and its energy of interaction with particles so that
total energy is conserved for the ensemble of realizable states. As a
byproduct, since the random field energy spectrum is unbounded, its canonical
conjugate, a self-adjoint time operator, is discussed. Finally, CSL is a
phenomenological description, whose connection to, or derivation from, more
conventional physics has not yet appeared. We suggest that, because CQC is
fully quantized, it is a natural framework for replacement of the classical
field of CSL by a quantized physical entity. Two illustrative examples are
given.

possible to a state under local operations with classical communication (LOCC);
however, this set of operations is complicated and difficult to describe
mathematically. An idea which has proven very useful is that of the {\it
entanglement monotone}: a function of the state which is invariant under local
unitary transformations and always decreases (or increases) on average after
any local operation. In this paper we look on LOCC as the set of operations
generated by {\it infinitesimal local operations}, operations which can be
performed locally and which leave the state little changed. We show that a
necessary and sufficient condition for a function of the state to be an
entanglement monotone under local operations that do not involve information
loss is that the function be a monotone under infinitesimal local operations.
We then derive necessary and sufficient differential conditions for a function
of the state to be an entanglement monotone. We first derive two conditions for
local operations without information loss, and then show that they can be
extended to more general operations by adding the requirement of {\it
convexity}. We then demonstrate that a number of known entanglement monotones
satisfy these differential criteria. Finally, as an application, we use the
differential conditions to construct a new polynomial entanglement monotone for
three-qubit pure states. It is our hope that this approach will avoid some of
the difficulties in the theory of multipartite and mixed-state entanglement.

measurement has only two possible outcomes. We find the structure of this
convex set of nonsignaling correlations by characterizing its extreme points.
Taking an information-theoretic view, we prove that all of these extreme
correlations are interconvertible. This suggests that the simplest extremal
nonlocal distribution (called a PR box) might be the basic unit of nonlocality.
We also show that this unit of nonlocality is sufficient to simulate all
quantum states when measured with two outcome measurements.

semigroups result, one directed toward the future and one directed toward the
