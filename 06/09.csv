acceleration in their environs. These generally fall into two classes: (1)
interplanetary shocks that are linear in their ion acceleration
characteristics, with the non-thermal ions serving as test particles, and (2)
non-linear systems such as the Earth's bow shock and the solar wind termination
shock, where the accelerated ions strongly influence the magnetohydrodynamic

acceleration at a particular interplanetary shock, with an emphasis on
explaining in situ measurements of ion distribution functions. The
observational data for this event was acquired on day 292 of 1991 by the
Ulysses mission. The modeling is performed using a well-known kinetic Monte
Carlo simulation, which has yielded good agreement with observations at several
heliospheric shocks, as have other theoretical techniques, namely hybrid plasma
simulations, and numerical solution of the diffusion-convection equation. In
this theory/data comparison, it is demonstrated that diffusive acceleration
theory can, to first order, successfully account for both the proton
distribution data near the shock, and the observation of energetic protons
farther upstream of this interplanetary shock than lower energy pick-up
protons, using a single turbulence parameter. The principal conclusion is that
diffusive acceleration of inflowing upstream ions can model this pick-up
ion-rich event without the invoking any seed pre-acceleration mechanism, though
this investigation does not rule out the action of such pre-acceleration.

differences in metallicity between DLAs and coeval luminous galaxies, and
between model predictions and observations. We use our measured zinc and
chromium abundances (combined with those for five more CORALS DLAs from the
literature, giving us a very nearly complete sample) to test whether the
metallicity and degree of dust depletion in CORALS DLAs are significantly
different from those of existing, larger, samples of DLAs drawn from magnitude
limited, optical surveys. We find that the column density weighted metallicity
of CORALS DLAs, [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -0.88 +/- 0.21 in the redshift interval 1.86 <
z(abs) < 3.45, is only marginally higher than that of a control sample from the
recent compilation by Kulkarni et al., [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -1.09 +/- 0.10. With
the present limited statistics this difference is not highly significant.
Furthermore, we find no evidence for increased dust depletions in CORALS
DLAs--their [Cr/Zn] ratios conform to the known trend of increasing depletion
(decreasing [Cr/Zn]) with increasing metallicity, and we have encountered no
cases where Cr is as depleted as in local cold interstellar clouds. These
results, when combined with the earlier findings of the CORALS survey reported
by Ellison et al. in 2001, make it difficult to invoke a dust-induced bias to
explain the generally low level of chemical evolution exhibited by most DLAs.
Rather, they indicate that large scale optical QSO surveys give a fair census

accretion activity. We show that TW Hya appears to be accreting material which
is significantly depleted in O relative to Ne. In constrast, BP Tau has an Ne/O
abundance ratio consistent with that observed for post-T Tauri stars. We
interpret this result in terms of the different ages and evolutionary states of
the circumstellar disks of these stars. In the young BP Tau disk (age 0.6 Myr)
dust is still present near the disk corotation radius and can be ionized and
accreted, re-releasing elements depleted onto grains. In the more evolved TW

inward-migrating gas, and accreting gas is consequently depleted of

young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region. The
submillimeter detection rate is 61% to a completeness limit of ~10 mJy
(3-sigma) at 850 microns. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are
log-normally distributed with a mean mass of ~0.005 solar masses and a large
dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one third of the submillimeter sources have disk
masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The
median disk to star mass ratio is 0.5%. The empirical behavior of the
submillimeter continuum is best described as F_nu ~ nu^(2.0 +/- 0.5) between
350 microns and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the
fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the
opacity compared to the ISM. This latter effect could be due to a substantial
population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through
collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is
correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence
for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and
submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy
distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of
objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction
with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer

low-mass stars in environments near massive stars, presenting a scenario for
the evolution of a star and its disk around the periphery of an expanding H II
region. The stages in this scenario begin with compression of molecular gas
around the edge of an H II region, continue as forming stars are overrun by the
advancing ionization front, and culminate when ejecta from one or more nearby
supernova explosions sweeps over YSO disks located in the low density interior
of the H II region, injecting SLRs including 26Al and 60Fe. We review the
evidence that this mode of star formation is more characteristic of formation
of low-mass stars than is the mode of star formation seen in regions such as
the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. We discuss the implications of this scenario
for our understanding of star formation, as well as the effects of the young
Sun's astrophysical environment on the formation and evolution of the Solar
System. We conclude that low-mass stars and their accompanying disks form and
evolve very differently near massive stars than they do in regions like
Taurus-Auriga, and that these differences have profound implications for our

SN1987A. The branching ratio of Type Ib/c supernovae into GRB-supernovae has
the remarkably small value of less than 0.5%. These observational constraints
point towards a rapidly rotating black hole formed at low probability with low

into a high-mass object with large rotational energy in angular momentum. As
the MeV-neutrino emissions from SN1987A demonstrate, the most powerful probe of

gravitational-wave emissions powered by a rapidly rotating central black hole

100Mpc through upcoming gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. We
identify the GRB-emissions, commonly attributed to ultrarelativistic

particles along the axis of rotation of a black hole in response to spin-orbit

desire to match the deprojected form of an R^{1/4} light-profile. Real
galaxies, however, are now known to have a range of different light-profile
shapes that scale with mass. Consequently, although highly useful, the above
models have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their
application to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the
analytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien (1997) closely matches
the deprojected form of Sersic R^{1/n} light-profiles - including deprojected
exponential light-profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in
spiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant
elliptical galaxies. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary
and special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated
with this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially
depleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole / galaxy
connection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived
similar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile.
Expressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also

through the full range of compactness ratios. The stronger VLBA detections can
themselves serve as phase-reference calibrators, boding well for opening up
much of the radio sky to VLBA imaging. For the adopted cosmology, the VLBA
resolution correponds to 17 pc or finer. Most VLBA detections are unresolved or
slightly resolved but one is diffuse and five show either double or core-jet
structures; the properties of these latter six are discussed in detail. Three
VLBA detections are unidentified and fainter than 25.5 mag in the optical I
band; their properties are highlighted because they likely mark
optically-obscured active nuclei at high redshift.

distribution function of the sum of Fourier phases. This statistic was recently
proposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations of
cosmological density fields. Since the Fourier phases are statistically
independent of Fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementary
role to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. In
particular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over three
closed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.
We find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in good
agreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. For
direct comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from N-body
simulations taking account of several observational effects such as the survey
geometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limited
number of data. Indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in the
range of absolute magnitude -22<Mr<-18 agree well with those for Lambda CDM
predictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from Gaussian initial condition. This
agreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshift
space. Instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadratic
deterministic function at scale larger than 30Mpc/h, we can constrain the ratio
of the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. We
find that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is well
fitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in CDM models. Indeed, b2/b1 is
nearly zero when sigma8=0.9.

the shock originating in the interaction of the wind of the more energetic

separation between the two stars varies. This cyclically drives the shock
inside the light cylinder radius of the less energetic pulsar.

same shape, well fitted by a composite of two Schechter functions with a marked
upturn and a steepening at the faint-end. Previously reported
cluster-to-cluster variations of the LF faint-end slope are due to the use of a
metric cluster aperture for computing the LF of clusters of different masses.
  We determine the composite LF for early- and late-type galaxies, where the
typing is based on the galaxy u-r colors. The late-type LF is well fitted by a
single Schechter function with a steep slope (alpha=-2.0 in the r band, within
r200}). The early-type LF instead cannot be fitted by a single Schechter
function, and a composite of two Schechter functions is needed. The faint-end
upturn of the global cluster LF is due to the early-type cluster galaxies. The
shape of the bright-end tail of the early-type LF does not seem to depend upon
the local galaxy density or the distance from the cluster center. The late-type
LF shows a significant variation only very near the cluster center. On the
other hand, the faint-end tail of the early-type LF shows a significant and
continuous variation with the environment. We provide evidence that the process
responsible for creating the excess population of dwarf early type galaxies in
clusters is a threshold process that occurs when the density exceeds ~500 times
the critical density of the Universe. We interpret our results in the context
of the 'harassment' scenario, where faint early-type cluster galaxies are

these trajectories and our source models, we construct arrival distributions of

appearance is determined by the chemical composition of the gas and the

major scale regimes: large-scale convective motions + gravitational settling
and small-scale turbulence + dust formation. Turbulence initiates dust
formation spot-like on small scale, while the dust feeds back into the
turbulent fluid field by its strong radiative cooling. Small, imploding dust
containing areas result which eventually become isothermal. Multi-dimensional
simulations show that these small-scale dust structures gather into large-scale
structures, suggesting the formation of clouds made of dirty dust grains. The
chemical composition of the grains, and thereby the chemical evolution of the

in the literature, we investigated the stability of globules on the basis of
xi_max, which characterizes the Bonnor-Ebert sphere as well as the stability of
the equilibrium state against the gravitational collapse. We found that more
than half of starless globules are located near the critical state (xi_max =
6.5 +/- 2). Thus, we suggest that a nearly critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere
characterizes the typical density structure of starless globules. Remaining
starless globules show clearly unstable states (xi_max > 10). Since unstable
equilibrium states are not long maintained, we expect that these globules are
on the way to gravitational collapse or that they are stabilized by non-thermal
support. It was also found that all the star-forming globules show unstable
solutions of xi_max >10, which is consistent with the fact that they have
started gravitational collapse. We investigated the evolution of a collapsing
gas sphere whose initial condition is a nearly critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. We
found that the column density profiles of the collapsing sphere mimic those of
the static Bonnor-Ebert spheres in unstable equilibrium. The collapsing gas
sphere resembles marginally unstable Bonnor-Ebert spheres for a long time. We
found that the frequency distribution of xi_max for the observed starless
globules is consistent with that from model calculations of the collapsing
sphere.

average value of [Fe/H]=-1.83 +/- 0.03 (r.m.s. 0.26 dex) and cover the
metallicity range -2.40<[Fe/H]<-0.85 (only 1 star with [Fe/H]>-1). The
star-to-star scatter is larger than typical errors on individual metallicities
(+/- 0.15-0.16 dex), indicating a real spread in metal abundances. The radial
velocities have a dispersion of 12.9 km/s, consistent with the dispersion
derived in Sculptor by Tolstoy et al. (2004). This along with the metallicity
distribution, suggests that most of the RR Lyr's arise from the same burst of
stellar formation that produced the metal-poor component giving origin to the
galaxy blue horizontal branch, and only a few (if any) come from the centrally
concentrated metal-rich red horizontal branch population. The spectroscopic
metallicities and the apparent luminosities were used to study the
luminosity-metallicity relation, for which we derive a shallow slope of 0.09

into a planetesimal disk. That planet's secular perturbations cause the orbits
of the planetesimals to evolve in such a way that at any one time planetesimals
at the same distance from the star have common pericentres and eccentricities.
This causes the surface density distribution of an extended planetesimal disk
to exhibit two spirals, one exterior the other interior to the planet's orbit.
These two spirals unwind in different directions and their structure is
described by two parameters: the time since the planet was introduced and the
planet's eccentricity. At late times the spirals become tightly wound and the
offset centre of symmetry of the pericentre glow approximation is recovered.
Comparison with spiral structure seen in the HD141569 disk shows that its
spiral at 325 AU is similar to that caused by introducing a planet 5 Myr ago
with a mass 0.2-2M_Jup orbiting at 235-250 AU with an eccentricity of 0.05-0.2;
likewise a Saturn mass planet at 150 AU would cause structure like that seen at
200 AU. More definitive statements about any planets orbiting HD141569 from
this model could be made once the effect of the binary companion on the disk is
known, and once the disk's structure has been better characterised down to 100
AU, including the location of the star within the disk. The relatively young
age of this system (~5 Myr) means that if giant planets really do exist at
hundreds of AU from HD141569, this provides a unique opportunity to set
constraints on the mechanism by which those planets came to be at such large
distances.

metals has provided an ideal setting for experimentally studying quantum
criticality. Motivated by these experiments, considerable theoretical efforts
have recently been devoted to reexamine the interplay between Kondo screening
and magnetic interactions in Kondo lattice systems. A local quantum critical
picture has emerged, in which magnetic interactions suppress Kondo screening
precisely at the magnetic quantum critical point (QCP). The Fermi surface
undergoes a large reconstruction across the QCP and the coherence scale of the
Kondo lattice vanishes at the QCP. The dynamical spin susceptibility exhibits
$\omega/T$ scaling and non-trivial exponents describe the temperature and
frequency dependence of various physical quantities. These properties are to be
contrasted with the conventional spin-density-wave (SDW) picture, in which the
Kondo screening is not suppressed at the QCP and the Fermi surface evolves
smoothly across the phase transition. In this article we discuss recent
microscopic studies of Kondo lattices within an extended dynamical mean field
theory (EDMFT). We summarize the earlier work based on an analytical
$\epsilon$-expansion renormalization group method, and expand on the more
recent numerical results. We also discuss the issues that have been raised
concerning the magnetic phase diagram. We show that the zero-temperature
magnetic transition is second order when double counting of the RKKY
interactions is avoided in EDMFT.

complementary experimental technique that has certain advantages over previous

suggest that colloidal diffusivity near solid surfaces contains signatures of
the degree of fluid slip exhibited on those surfaces. To investigate, we
calculate the image system for point forces (Stokeslets) oriented perpendicular
and parallel to a surface with a finite slip length, analogous to Blake's
solution for a Stokeslet near a no-slip wall. Notably, the image system for the
point source and perpendicular Stokeslet contain the same singularities as
Blake's solution; however, each is distributed along a line with a magnitude
that decays exponentially over the slip length. The image system for the
parallel Stokeslet involves a larger set of fundamental singularities, whose
magnitude does not decay exponentially from the surface. Using these image
systems, we determine the wall-induced correction to the diffusivity of a small
spherical particle located `far' from the wall. We also calculate the coupled
diffusivities between multiple particles near a partially-slipping wall.
Because, in general, the diffusivity depends on `local' wall conditions,
patterned surfaces would allow differential measurements to be obtained within
a single experimental cell, eliminating potential cell-to-cell variability
encountered in previous experiments. In addition to motivating the proposed
experiments, our solutions for point forces and sources near a partial-slip
wall will be useful for boundary integral calculations in slip systems.

antiferromagnetically at Tc1~87 K with their direction within the plane, while
the Co sites with the smaller nQ value have the smaller moments. They align
along the direction parallel to the c axis. The ordered moments at the two
distinct sites exhibit the same T dependences, indicating that the existence of
these sites is not due to a macroscopic phase separation. Although we have

represented higher in the cortical hierarchy. For example, the concept of a
dog, represented across a region of high-level cortical-neurons, can either be
written or spoken about depending on the individual's context. The higher-layer
cortical areas project down the hierarchy, sending abstract information to
specific regions of the motor-cortex for contextual implementation. In this
paper, this idea is expanded to incorporate collective-intelligence within a
hyper-cortical construct. This hyper-cortex is a multi-layered network used to
represent abstract collective concepts. These ideas play an important role in
understanding how collective-intelligence systems can be engineered to handle

stages. The role of the preprocessing stage is to expose the tree structure in
a form {\em matched} to the search stage. We argue that the minimum mean square

joint detection and decoding problem in a single search stage. It is further
shown that MMSE-DFE filtering allows for using lattice reduction methods to
reduce complexity, at the expense of a marginal performance loss, and solving
under-determined linear systems. For the search stage, we present a generic
method, based on the branch and bound (BB) algorithm, and show that it
encompasses all existing sphere decoders as special cases. The proposed generic
algorithm further allows for an interesting classification of tree search
decoders, sheds more light on the structural properties of all known sphere
decoders, and inspires the design of more efficient decoders. In particular, an
efficient decoding algorithm that resembles the well known Fano sequential
decoder is identified. The excellent performance-complexity tradeoff achieved

both effects are controlled by the auxiliary fields. We eliminate the auxiliary

as opposed to exterior forms, are deforming manifolds (with unclosed metric
forms). Such differential forms arise when describing physical processes. A
specific feature of evolutionary forms is the fact that from the evolutionary
forms, which correspond to the conservation laws for material media, the closed
exterior forms, which correspond to the conservation laws for physical fields,
are obtained. This shows that material media generate physical fields. And by
this the determinacy of physical processes and phenomena is revealed.
  In this paper we obtain the mathematic apparatus that allows to describe
discrete transitions and quantum jumps. This relates to the fact that the
mathematic apparatus of exterior and evolutionary forms, which basis involves
nonidentical relations and degenerate transformations, can describe transitions
from nonconjugate operators to conjugate ones. None of mathematic formalisms
contains such possibilities.

models are: a) the mobility $\mu$ of particles depends on the locally-averaged
particle density and b) linear diffusion acts on that locally-averaged particle
density. The cases both with and without diffusion are considered here.
Surprisingly, these simple modifications of standard models allow progress in
the analytical description of evolution as well as the complete analysis of
stationary states. When $\mu$ remains positive, the evolution of collapsed
states in our model reduces exactly to finite-dimensional dynamics of
interacting particle clumps. Simulations show these collapsed (clumped) states
emerging from smooth initial conditions, even in one spatial dimension. If
$\mu$ vanishes for some averaged density, the evolution leads to spontaneous
formation of \emph{jammed patches} (weak solution with density having compact
support). Simulations confirm that a combination of these patches forms the
final state for the system.

a small amount. These are consequences of having a strongly inhomogeneous
matter where the QGP component is concentrated around midrapidity. We also show
how to constrain the values of the charge correlations lengths in both the
hadronic phase and the QGP phase using the charge transfer fluctuations.

circuit extends throughout the atmosphere from the planetary surface to the

permit a vertical conduction current to flow in the fair weather part of the
global circuit. Through the (inverse) solar modulation of cosmic rays, the
resulting columnar ionisation changes may allow the global circuit to convey a
solar influence to meteorological phenomena of the lower atmosphere. Electrical
effects on non-thunderstorm clouds have been proposed to occur via the
ion-assisted formation of ultrafine aerosol, which can grow to sizes able to
act as cloud condensation nuclei, or through the increased ice nucleation
capability of charged aerosols. Even small atmospheric electrical modulations
on the aerosol size distribution can affect cloud properties and modify the
radiative balance of the atmosphere, through changes communicated globally by
the atmospheric electrical circuit. Despite a long history of work in related

employ an alternative method, principal component regression, which is a

a single dominant component which explains 40-fold more variation in

a single determinant among the seven predictors. The dominant component
explains nearly half the variation in the rate of synonymous and protein

operator-valued measures (POVMs); however, tensor products of POVMs are
compatible with conditional density operators. By way of application,
conditional density operators together with the free choice of probe particles
allow the so-called postulate of state reductions to be replaced by a theorem.
A second application demonstrates an equivalence between one form of quantum
key distribution and another, allowing a formulation of individual
eavesdropping attacks against transmitted-state BB84 to work also for
entangled-state BB84.

information in the presence of noise. It generalizes the standard theory of
quantum error-correction, and provides a unified framework for topics such as
quantum error-correction, decoherence-free subspaces, and noiseless subsystems.
This paper develops (a) easily applied algebraic and information-theoretic
conditions which characterize when operator quantum error-correction is
feasible; (b) a representation theorem for a class of noise processes which can
be corrected using operator quantum error-correction; and (c) generalizations
of the coherent information and quantum data processing inequality to the
setting of operator quantum error-correction.

  Panangaden","Distributed measurement-based quantum computation","17 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We develop a formal model for distributed measurement-based quantum
computations, adopting an agent-based view, such that computations are
described locally where possible. Because the network quantum state is in
general entangled, we need to model it as a global structure, reminiscent of
global memory in classical agent systems. Local quantum computations are
described as measurement patterns. Since measurement-based quantum computation
is inherently distributed, this allows us to extend naturally several concepts
of the measurement calculus, a formal model for such computations. Our goal is
to define an assembly language, i.e. we assume that computations are
well-defined and we do not concern ourselves with verification techniques. The
operational semantics for systems of agents is given by a probabilistic
transition system, and we define operational equivalence in a way that it
corresponds to the notion of bisimilarity. With this in place, we prove that
teleportation is bisimilar to a direct quantum channel, and this also within
the context of larger networks.

  McKenzie","Teleportation via multi-qubit channels","32 pages, 2 figures, reference added, historical inaccuracy corrected",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the problem of teleporting an unknown qubit state to a
recipient via a channel of $2\L$ qubits. In this procedure a protocol is
employed whereby $\L$ Bell state measurements are made and information based on
these measurements is sent via a classical channel to the recipient. Upon
receiving this information the recipient determines a local gate which is used
to recover the original state. We find that the $2^{2\L}$-dimensional Hilbert
space of states available for the channel admits a decomposition into four
subspaces. Every state within a given subspace is a perfect channel, and each
sequence of Bell measurements projects $2\L$ qubits of the system into one of
the four subspaces. As a result, only two bits of classical information need be
sent to the recipient for them to determine the gate. We note some connections
between these four subspaces and ground states of many-body Hamiltonian
systems, and discuss the implications of these results towards understanding
entanglement in multi-qubit systems.

given Pauli channels. We show that, differently from the case of discrimination
between unitary transformations, the use of entanglement with an ancillary
system can strictly improve the discrimination, and any maximally entangled
state allows to achieve the optimal discrimination. We also provide a simple
necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the structure of the channels
for which the ultimate minimum error probability can be achieved without
entanglement assistance. When such a condition is satisfied, the optimal input
state is simply an eigenstate of one of the Pauli matrices.

For qubits (or spin 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under
$SL(2,\CC)$. This implies that the {\em filters} obtained from the combs are
entanglement monotones by construction. We give alternative formulae for the
concurrence and the 3-tangle as expectation values of certain antilinear
operators. As an application we discuss inequivalent types of genuine four-,
five- and six-qubit entanglement.
