as neutron stars or even the more exotic strange stars, based on the
Bodmer-Witten conjecture. Bare strange quark stars and (normal) strange
quark-matter stars, those possessing a baryon (electron-supported) crust, are
hypothesized as good candidates to explain the properties of a set of peculiar
stellar sources as the enigmatic X-ray source RX J1856.5-3754, some pulsars as
PSR B1828-11 and PSR B1642-03, and the anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft
gamma-ray repeaters. In the MIT bag model, quarks are treated as a degenerate
Fermi gas confined to a region of space having a vacuum energy density
$B_{bag}$ (the Bag constant). In this note, we modif{}y the MIT Bag Model by
including the electromagnetic interaction. We also show that this version of
the MIT model implies the anisotropy of the Bag pressure due to the presence of
the magnetic field. The equations of state of degenerate quarks gases are
studied in the presence of ultra strong magnetic fields. The behavior of a
system made-up of quarks having (or not) anomalous magnetic moment is reviewed.
A structural instability is found, which is related to the anisotropic nature
of the pressures in this highly magnetized matter. The conditions for the
collapse of this system are obtained and compared to a previous model of
neutron stars build-up on a neutron gas having anomalous magnetic moment.

47 X-ray point sources, most of which are likely LMXBs, within 4 R_e. The
brightest X-ray source coincides with the optical/UV/radio center of the
galaxy, and shows variability on >1 hr timescales, indicating the possible
existence of a LLAGN. The 46 off-center sources and the unresolved point
sources contribute about 29% and 20% to the total luminosity of the galaxy,
respectively. The corrected cumulative XLF of the off-center sources is best
fit by a broken power-law model with a break at L_b=4.4+2.0-1.4 e38 ergs/s. We
identified 210 GCs candidates in a HST WFPC2 optical image of the galaxy's
central region. Of the 25 off-center LMXBs that fall within the WFPC2 FOV, 10
sources are coincident with a GC. Thus the fraction of the GCs hosting bright
LMXBs and the fraction of the LMXBs associated with GCs are 4.8% and 40%,
respectively. In the V and I bands, the GCs hosting bright LMXBs are typically
1-2 magnitudes brighter than the GCs with no detected LMXBs. There are about
1.9+-0.4 times as many LMXBs in the red, metal-rich GCs as there are in the
blue, metal-poor ones. We find no obvious difference between the luminosity
distributions of LMXBs in GCs and in field, but the cumulative spectrum of the
LMXBs in GCs tends to be softer than that of the LMXBs in field. We detected 3
X-ray sources that have isotropic luminosities larger than 1e39 erg/s. The one
located in the joint Chandra-HST field is found to be associated with a GC. By
studying the ACIS spectra we infer that the this may be a candidate black hole
system with a mass of 15-135 M_sun. One of the other sources with a luminosity
brighter than 1e39 ergs/s reveals temporal variations in brightness on

galaxies MS 0839.9+2938. By performing both the projected and deprojected
spectral analyses, we find that the gas temperature is approximately constant
at about 4 keV in 130-444h_70^-1 kpc. In the inner regions, the gas temperature
descends towards the center, reaching <~ 3 keV in the central 37h_70^-1 kpc.
This infers that the lower and upper limits of the mass deposit rate are 9-34
M_sun yr^-1 and 96-126 M_sun yr^-1, respectively within 74h_70^-1 kpc where the
gas is significantly colder. Along with the temperature drop, we detect a
significant inward iron abundance increase from about 0.4 solar in the outer
regions to about 1 solar within the central 37h_70^-1 kpc. Thus MS 0839.9+2938
is the cluster showing the most significant central iron excess at z>~ 0.2. We
argue that most of the excess iron should have been contributed by SNe Ia. By
utilizing the observed SN Ia rate and stellar mass loss rate, we estimate that
the time needed to enrich the central region with excess iron is 6.4-7.9 Gyr,
which is similar to those found for the nearby clusters. Coinciding with the
optical extension of the cD galaxy (up to about 30h_70^-1 kpc), the observed
X-ray surface brightness profile exhibits an excess beyond the distribution
expected by either the beta model or the NFW model, and can be well fitted with
an empirical two-beta model that leads to a relatively flatter mass profile in
the innermost region.

decreases very rapidly, on the scale of a few interatomic layers, with the
increasing DW width. The largest MR value of about 250% is predicted for an
abrupt DW in the monatomic wire. We show that, for some energy values, the
density of states and the conductance may be non-zero only in one spin channel,
making the MR for the abrupt DW infinitely large. We also demonstrate that for
the abrupt DW a large MR may occur due to the hybridization between two spin
subbands across the DW interface. We do not find, however, such a behavior at

algorithms that are almost as good as the best decision rules in a wide

finite-dimensional (often countable) benchmark classes. In this paper we give
similar results for decision rules ranging over an arbitrary reproducing kernel

(including the standard square, absolute, and log loss functions) the average
loss of the master algorithm, over the first $N$ observations, does not exceed
the average loss of the best decision rule with a bounded norm plus
$O(N^{-1/2})$. Our proof technique is very different from the standard ones and
is based on recent results about defensive forecasting. Given the probabilities
produced by a defensive forecasting algorithm, which are known to be well
calibrated and to have good resolution in the long run, we use the expected
loss minimization principle to find a suitable decision.

Lagrange structure which is more general than the Lagrangian formalism in the

Lagrange structure is shown to admit a natural BRST description which is used
to construct an AKSZ-type topological sigma-model. The dynamics of this
sigma-model in $d+1$ dimensions, being localized on the boundary, are proved to
be equivalent to the original theory in $d$ dimensions. As the topological
sigma-model has a well defined action, it is path-integral quantized in the
usual way that results in quantization of the original (not necessarily

principle, the standard BV path-integral is explicitly deduced from the

positive dimension. By a Leonard pair on $V$ we mean an ordered pair of linear
transformations $A:V \to V$ and $A^*:V \to V$ that satisfy the following two
conditions:
  (i) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix
representing $A$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A^*$
is diagonal.
  (ii) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix
representing $A^*$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A$
is diagonal.
  Let $v^*_0, ..., v^*_d$ (resp. $v_0, ..., v_d$) denote a basis for $V$ that
satisfies (i) (resp. (ii)). For $0 \leq i \leq d$ let $a_i$ denote the
coefficient of $v^*_i$, when we write $A v^*_i$ as a linear combination of
$v^*_0, ..., v^*_d$, and let $a^*_i$ denote the coefficient of $v_i$, when we
write $A^* v_i$ as a linear combination of $v_0..., v_d$. In this paper we show
$a_0=a_d$ if and only if $a^*_0=a^*_d$. Moreover we show that for $d \geq 1$
the following are equivalent: (i) $a_0=a_d$ and $a_1=a_{d-1}$; (ii)
$a^*_0=a^*_d$ and $a^*_1=a^*_{d-1}$; (iii) $a_i=a_{d-i}$ and $a^*_i=a^*_{d-i}$
for $0 \leq i \leq d$. We say $A$, $A^*$ is balanced whenever (i)--(iii) hold.
We say $A$, $A^*$ is essentially bipartite (resp. essentially dual bipartite})
whenever $a_i$ (resp. $a^*_i$) is independent of $i$ for $0 \leq i \leq d$.
Observe that if $A$, $A^*$ is essentially bipartite or dual bipartite, then
$A$, $A^*$ is balanced. For $d \neq 2$ we show that if $A$, $A^*$ is balanced
then $A$, $A^*$ is essentially bipartite or dual bipartite.

efficient means for pumping these devices, and initial measurements employing
fiber pumping and collection are presented. Implications of this work towards

Concurrency control techniques and extra registers for marking and storing the

reduce the time complexity to $O(M+\log N)$.
