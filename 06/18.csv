examined. For neutron star matter, the influence of a finite fraction of
protons and electrons and of strong nucleon-nucleon interactions are studied.
The nucleon--nucleon interactions are introduced within a Hartree-Fock scheme

properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the
decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of
simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities (here from Bruzual
& Charlot 2003), producing as output the star-formation and chemical histories
of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. We discuss the reliability
of this approach and apply it to a volume limited sample of 50362 galaxies from
the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalog of stellar population properties.
A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of
these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative
agreement, despite substantial differences in the method of analysis. The
confidence in the method is further strengthened by several empirical and
astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and
independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong
correlations between stellar and nebular metallicites, stellar and nebular
extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000 \AA
break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We also present
preliminary results of an analysis of a magnitude-limited sample which clearly
reveals that the bimodality of galaxy populations is present in the parameters
computed in the synthesis. Our results are also consistent with the
""down-sizing"" scenario of galaxy formation and evolution. Finally, we point out
one of the major problems facing spectral synthesis of early-type systems: the
spectral base adopted here is based on solar-scaled evolutionary tracks whose
abundance pattern may not be appropriate for this type of galaxy.

is possible in a variety of inflationary models, although probably not in any

redshift survey to constrain the incidence of major mergers between
spheroid-dominated galaxies with little cold gas (dry mergers) since z = 0.7. A
set of N-body merger simulations was used to explore the morphological
signatures of such interactions: they are recognizable either as < 5kpc
separation close pairs or because of broad, low surface brightness tidal
features and asymmetries. Data with the depth and resolution of GEMS are
sensitive to dry mergers between galaxies with M_V < -20.5 for z < 0.7; dry
mergers at higher redshifts are not easily recovered in single-orbit HST
imaging. Six dry mergers (12 galaxies) with luminosity ratios between 1:1 and
4:1 were found from a sample of 379 red early-type galaxies with M_V < -20.5
and 0.1 < z < 0.7. The simulations suggest that the morphological signatures of
dry merging are visible for ~250Myr and we use this timescale to convert the
observed merger incidence into a rate. On this basis we find that present day
spheroidal galaxies with M_V < -20.5 on average have undergone between 0.5 and
2 major dry mergers since z ~ 0.7. We have compared this result with the
predictions of a Cold Dark Matter based semi-analytic galaxy formation model.
The model reproduces the observed declining major merger fraction of bright
galaxies and the space density of luminous early-type galaxies reasonably well.
The predicted dry merger fraction is consistent with our observational result.
Hence, hierarchical models predict and observations now show that major dry
mergers are an important driver of the evolution of massive early-type galaxies
in recent epochs.

galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar stellar component extending up to 15
scale heights (~3.5 kpc) above the plane. We analyze the vertical distribution
as a function of stellar age by tracking changes in the color-magnitude
diagram. The young stellar component (< 10^8 yrs) is found to have a scale
height larger than the young component in the Milky Way, suggesting that stars
in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk. We also find that the scale
height of a stellar population increases with age, with young main sequence
stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars, and old red giant branch
stars having succesively larger scale heights in each galaxy. The color
distributions of the red giant branch (RGB) stars well above the midplane
indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,
with peak metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -1 and with little or no metallicity
gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a
majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not
dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like
the Milky Way, low mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. We
examine our results in light of disk heating and merger scenarios and conclude

may expect through a steady accretion of satellites, i.e., on average there is
no mass infall. This is strikingly different from more massive halos, which
have large infall velocities outside of the virial radius. We provide accurate
fit for the density profile of these galaxy-size halos. For a wide range

shock-ionized gas where a precessing jet interacts with dense gas. This jet
probably drives the E-W CO outflow. The origin of this jet must be located
close to A2, and may be the submm source Aa. Thus source A is now shown to
comprise three components within 1"". Source B, however, is single, exhibits
optically-thick dust emission even at 8 GHz, has a high luminosity, and yet
shows no sign of outflow, indicating it is probably very young.
  The SMA spectrum of IRAS 16293-2422 reports the first astronomical
identification of many lines at 300 and 310 GHz. The species detected are
typical of hot cores, and are mainly associated with source A. We suggest the
shock at A1 may explain the enhanced abundances measured, especially of
sulphur-bearing molecules. We use the high brightness temperature of the submm
dust emission from source B to demonstrate the unambiguous detection of infall
by observing redshifted SO (7_7-6_6) absorption against the dust disk.

transitions of bosons on the triangular lattice, focusing primarily on the
interplay between Mott localization and geometrical charge frustration at
1/2-filling. A general dual vortex field theory is developed for arbitrary
rational filling factors f, based on the appropriate projective symmetry group.
At the simple non-frustrated density f=1/3, we uncover an example of a
deconfined quantum critical point very similar to that found on the half-filled
square lattice. Turning to f=1/2, the behavior is quite different. Here, we
find that the low-energy action describing the Mott transition has an emergent
nonabelian SU(2)\times U(1) symmetry, not present at the microscopic level.
This large nonabelian symmetry is directly related to the frustration-induced
quasi-degeneracy between many charge-ordered states not related by microscopic
symmetries. Through this ``pseudospin'' SU(2)symmetry, the charged excitations
in the insulator close to the Mott transition develop a skyrmion-like
character. This leads to an understanding of the recently discovered supersolid
phase of the triangular lattice XXZ model (cond-mat/0505258, cond-mat/0505257,
cond-mat/0505298) as a ``partially melted'' Mott insulator. The latter picture
naturally explains a number of puzzling numerical observations of the
properties of this supersolid. Moreover, we predict that the nearby quantum
phase transition from this supersolid to the Mott insulator is in the
recently-discovered non-compact CP^1 critical universality class (PRB 70,

lattice-matched semiconductor heterostructures, focusing on nonanalytic
behavior at small values of the crystal momentum, which gives rise to
long-range Coulomb potentials. A nonlinear response theory is developed for
nonlocal spin-dependent perturbing potentials. The ionic pseudopotential of the
heterostructure is treated as a perturbation of a bulk reference crystal, and
the self-energy is derived to second order in the perturbation. If spin-orbit
coupling is neglected outside the atomic cores, the problem can be analyzed as
if the perturbation were a local spin scalar, since the nonlocal spin-dependent
part of the pseudopotential merely renormalizes the results obtained from a
local perturbation. The spin-dependent terms in the self-energy therefore fall
into two classes: short-range potentials that are analytic in momentum space,
and long-range nonanalytic terms that arise from the screened Coulomb potential
multiplied by a spin-dependent vertex function. For an insulator at zero
temperature, it is shown that the electronic charge induced by a given
perturbation is exactly linearly proportional to the charge of the perturbing
potential. These results are used in a subsequent paper to develop a
first-principles effective-mass theory with generalized Rashba spin-orbit

that do not vanish for the Schwarzschild geometry one generically recovers an
acceptable Newtonian limit at small distances. Gravity is however modified at
large distances. We compute the first correction to the Newtonian potential in
a quite general class of models. The characteristic distance entering in these
modifications is of the order of 10pc for the Sun and of the order of 10^2 kpc
for a galaxy.

The limit arises in this setup from the requirement that the Casimir energy

of the universe. The Casimir energy densities can be exponentially suppressed
to an almost arbitrarily small value by the masses of heavy bulk fields,
thereby allowing a tiny size of the extra dimension. This suppression is only
restricted by the strong coupling scale of the theory, which is known to be
related to the compactification scale via an UV/IR connection for local
gravitational theory spaces. We thus obtain an upper limit on the
compactification scale of the discrete gravitational extra dimension in the
range 10^7 GeV...10^12 GeV, while the strong coupling scale is by a factor 10^2
larger than the compactification scale. We also comment on a possible
cancelation of the gravitational contribution to the quantum effective
potential.

However if the majority relies on herding, this mechanism may dramatically fail
to aggregate correctly the information, causing the majority adopting the wrong
choice. We address these issues in a simple model of interacting agents who aim
at giving a correct forecast of a public variable, either seeking private
information or resorting to herding. As the fraction of herders increases, the
model features a phase transition beyond which a state where most agents make
the correct forecast coexists with one where most of them are wrong. Simple

insertion is presented. The method is based on biasing the sampling within the
subdomains of the test-particle configurational space with energies smaller
than a given value freely assigned. These energy-wells are located via unbiased
random insertion over the whole configurational space and are sampled using the
so called Hit&Run algorithm, which uniformly samples compact regions of any
shape immersed in a space of arbitrary dimensions. Because the bias is defined
in terms of the energy landscape it can be exactly corrected to obtain the
unbiased distribution. The test-particle energy distribution is then combined
with the Bennett relation for the evaluation of the chemical potential. We
apply this protocol to a system with relatively small probability of low-energy
test-particle insertion, liquid argon at high density and low temperature, and
show that the energy-biased Bennett method is around five times more efficient
than the standard Bennett method. A similar performance gain is observed in the
reconstruction of the energy distribution.

accurate, compact finite-difference schemes over a variable-spacing mesh in the

algorithm is designed in such a way as to minimize data exchange among the
computing machines, and in particular to avoid taking a global transpose of the
data during the pseudo-spectral evaluation of the non-linear terms. The
computing machines can then be connected to each other through low-cost network
devices. The code is optimized for memory requirements, which can moreover be
subdivided among the computing nodes. The layout of a simple, dedicated and
optimized computing system based on commodity hardware is described. The
performance of the numerical method on this computing system is evaluated and
compared with that of other codes described in the literature, as well as with
that of the same code implementing a commonly employed strategy for the
