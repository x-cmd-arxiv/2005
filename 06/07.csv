irregular (dIm) galaxy DDO 43, in conjunction with optical broad and narrow
band images in U, B, V, and Halpha. The observations are used to examine the
relationship between its HI morphology and kinematics to past and present star
formation. Optically, it is a small (R_25 = 990 pc), faint (M_B of -14.0) Im
with a slightly boxy shape. In HI, DDO 43 has an extended (R_HI/R_Ho = 2.8) gas
envelope. There is a high density ridge associated with the optical body of the
galaxy, containing several higher density knots and lower density holes. The
largest hole is ~850x530 pc. No expansion is detected, so it must be relatively
old. The largest and potentially oldest (7-70 Myr) of the six identified star
clusters is located at the western edge of the hole. Four of the other clusters
are located near high density peaks. There are several HII regions, most of
which are associated with peaks in the HI surface density. The overall star
formation rate is average for its type. In many ways, DDO 43 is a very typical
dwarf irregular galaxy. Its HI morphology is consistent with a history of
episodes of localized star ormation that create holes and shells in the ISM,
some of which can overlap. These features are located within the area of
solid-body rotation in the galaxy; the lack of shear in these small systems
allows such structures to persist for long periods of time.

are located at the distances implied by their redshifts, a number of
observations still challenge this interpretation, possibly indicating that some
subpopulation of quasars may harbour significant redshift components not
related to the expansion of the universe. It has been suggested that these
objects may have been ejected from local galaxies and are likely to evolve into
new galaxies themselves. Here, a test of such exotic scenarios is proposed,
based on the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies hosting quasars with
suspected ejection origin. Provided that the time scales over which the ejected
objects manifest themselves as quasars is short, one would in the framework of
ejection scenarios expect to find either no quasar host galaxy, a pseudo-host
consisting of gas ionized by the quasar, or a host galaxy consisting of young
stars only. It is argued that the spectral energy distributions corresponding
to the latter two options should differ significantly from those of most quasar
host galaxies detected at low redshift so far, thus providing a potential test
of the claimed existence of ejected quasars. A minimal implementation of this
test, involving optical and near-IR broadband photometry, is suggested.

that the ram pressures of the stellar wind and ambient interstellar medium
cause the accumulated mass in the bow shock to flow along the surface of the

derived by the analytical solution. It further predicts that the pressure

six low-mass, edge-on, spiral galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope

stellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane.
We analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by tracking
changes in the color-magnitude diagram. The young stellar component (<10^8 yrs)
is found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the Milky
Way, suggesting that stars in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk.
We also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age,
with young main sequence stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars,
and old red giant branch stars having succesively larger scale heights in each
galaxy. This systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some role
in producing the extraplanar stars. We constrain the rate of disk heating using
the observed trend between scale height and stellar age, and find that the
observed heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the Milky Way. The
color distributions of the red giant branch stars well above the midplane
indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,
with peak metallicities around [Fe/H]=-1 and with little or no metallicity
gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a
majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not
dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like
the Milky Way, low-mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. In
its structure, mean metallicity and old age, the RGB component in these
galaxies seems analagous to the Milky Way thick disk. [ABRIDGED]

form after the gravitational collapse of massive rotating stellar cores, or the
coalescence of two compact objects in a binary (e.g., the Hulse--Taylor
system). The physical composition is determined self consistently by
considering two regimes: neutrino--opaque and neutrino--transparent, with a
detailed equation of state which takes into account neutronization, nuclear
statistical equilibrium of a gas of free nucleons and alpha particles,
blackbody radiation and a relativistic Fermi gas of arbitrary degeneracy.
Various neutrino emission processes are considered, with electron/positron
capture onto free nucleons providing the dominant contribution to the cooling
rate. We find that important temporal and spatial scales, related to the
optically thin/optically thick transition are present in the disk, and manifest
themselves clearly in the energy output in neutrinos. This transition produces
an inversion of the lepton gradient in the innermost regions of the flow which
drives convective motions, and affects the density and disk scale height radial
profiles. The electron fraction remains low in the region close to the black
hole, and if preserved in an outflow, could give rise to heavy element
nucleosynthesis. Our specific initial conditions arise from the binary merger
context, and so we explore the implications of our results for the production

development of strong isotropic winds emanating from massive clusters, capable
of disrupting the remains of the parental cloud as well as causing the
large-scale restructuring of the surrounding ISM, has usually been taken as a
negative feedback agent. Here we show the impact that radiative cooling has on

the star cluster volume itself (~ 30% of the deposited energy), the force of
gravity takes over and drives in situ all the matter deposited by winds and
supernovae into several generations of star formation. A situation in which the
mass deposition rate from the star cluster instead of causing a wind as in the

First, we show that in the quasi-steady state of turbulence driven by
magnetorotational instability in a typical protoplanetary disk with dust
grains, the amount of energy dissipation should be sufficient for providing the
ionization energy that is required for activating magnetorotational
instability. Second, we show that in the disk with dust grains the energetic
electrons that compose electric currents in weakly ionized gas can provide
collisional ionization, depending on the actual saturation state of
magnetorotational turbulence. On the other hand, we show that in the
protoplanetary disks with the reduced effect of dust grains, the turbulent
motion can homogenize the ionization degree, leading to the activation of
magnetorotational instability even in the absence of other ionization
processes. The results in this Letter indicate that most of the regions in
protoplanetary disks remain magnetically active, and we thus require a change
in the theoretical modeling of planet formation.

density and magnetic field of the flaring structure. A total of 32 events (the

A broad range of decay times (from 10 to 400 ks) are present in the sample.
Peak flare temperatures are often very high, with half of the flares in the
sample showing temperatures in excess of 100 MK. Significant sustained heating
is present in the majority of the flares. The magnetic structures which are
found, are in a number of cases very long, with semi-lengths up to 10^12 cm,
implying the presence of magnetic fields of hundreds of G extending to
comparable distance from the stellar photosphere. These very large sizes for
the flaring structures ($ >> R_*) are not found in more evolved stars, where,
almost invariably, the same type of analysis results in structures with L <=
R_*. As the majority of young stars in the ONC are surrounded by disks, we
speculate that the large magnetic structures which confine the flaring plasma
are actually the same type of structures which channel the plasma in the
magnetospheric accretion paradigm, connecting the star's photosphere with the

a slab equilibrium model in which the gravity (including self-gravity) is
perpendicular to the mid-plane, the magnetic field lies along the slab. CR is
described as a fluid and only along magnetic field lines diffusion is
considered. The linearised equations are solved numerically. The system is
susceptible to Parker-Jeans instability. In general the system is less unstable
when the CR diffusion coefficient is smaller (i.e., the coupling between the
CRs and plasma is stronger). The system is also less unstable if CR pressure is
larger. This is a reminiscence of the fact that Jeans instability and Parker
instability are less unstable when the gas pressure is larger (or temperature
is higher). Moreover, for large CR diffusion coefficient (or small CR
pressure), perturbations parallel to the magnetic field are more unstable than
those perpendicular to it. The other governing factor on the growth rate of the
perturbations in different directions is the thickness of the disk or the
strength of the external pressure on the disk. In fact, this is the determining
factor in some parameter regimes.

on a diagrammatic technique. Similar to the method of correlated-basis

linked-cluster expansion in terms of diagrams which are categorized and
constructed according to a few simple rules and using correlation coefficients
and Pauli exclusion principle (or Pauli line) as basic elements. Infinite
resummations of diagrams can then be done in a straightforward manner. One such
resummation, which includes all so-called ring diagrams and ignores Pauli
exclusion principle, reproduces spin-wave theory (SWT). Approximations beyond
SWT are also given. Interestingly, one such approximation including all
so-called super-ring diagrams by a resummation of infinite Pauli lines in
additional to resummations of ring diagrams produces a convergent, precise
number for the order-parameter of the one-dimensional isotropic model, contrast
to the well-known divergence of SWT. We also discuss the direct relation
between our variational CCM and CBF and discuss a possible unification of the
two theories.

and is valid for all values of the on-site interaction $U$ including the Kondo
regime. We calculate the critical magnetic field for the splitting of the Kondo
resonance to be seen in the differential conductivity as function of bias
voltage. Our calculations for small field show that the peak position of the
component resonances in the differential conductance are reduced substantially
from estimates using the equilibrium Green's function. We conclude that it is
important to take the voltage dependence of the local retarded Green's function
into account in interpreting experimental results

  Cooperative Channels","40 pages, 12 figures, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  In this paper, we propose novel cooperative transmission protocols for delay
limited coherent fading channels consisting of N (half-duplex and
single-antenna) partners and one cell site. In our work, we differentiate
between the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative
multiple-access (up-link) channels. For the relay channel, we investigate two
classes of cooperation schemes; namely, Amplify and Forward (AF) protocols and
Decode and Forward (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper
bound on the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We
then construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed
algorithm is then extended to the general case with N-1 relays where it is
shown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and Worenell
without requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class of DF
protocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol that achieves
the optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0 < r < 1/N. Furthermore, with a
single relay, the DDF protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols
for all multiplexing gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be
more significant in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is
reversed in the cooperative multiple-access channel where we propose a new AF
protocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A
distinguishing feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that
they do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient use of
resources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the sub-optimality of
previously proposed protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces
rather than the half-duplex constraint.

centre-of-mass degrees of freedom of a closed system of N identical
uniform-mass balls of mass M and radius R, taking account of quantum
gravitational effects and then tracing over the gravitational field amounts to
multiplying the position-space density matrix \rho(x_1,...,x_N; x_1',...,x_N')=
\psi(x_1,...,x_N)\psi*(x_1',...,x_N') by a multiplicative factor, which, if the
positions {x_1,...,x_N; x_1',...,x_N'} are all much further away from one
another than R, is well-approximated by the product from 1 to N over I, J, K
(I<J) of ((|x_K-x_K'|/R)(|x_I'-x_J||x_I-x_J'|/|x_I-x_J||x_I'-x_J'|))^{-24M^2}.
Here we show that if each uniform-mass ball is replaced by a grainy ball or
more general-shaped lump of similar size consisting of a number, n, of
well-spaced small balls of mass m and radius r and, in the above formula, R is
replaced by r, M by m and the products are taken over all Nn positions of all
the small balls, then the result is well-approximated by replacing R in the
original formula by a new value R_eff. This suggests that the original formula
will apply in general to physically realistic lumps -- be they macroscopic
lumps of ordinary matter with the grains atomic nuclei etc. or be they atomic
nuclei themselves with their own (quantum) grainy substructure -- provided R is
chosen suitably. In the case of a cubical lump consisting of n=(2L+1)^3 small

and homogeneous) background is described by a viscous fluid having an
ultrarelativistic equation of state and whose viscosity coefficient is related
to the energy density via a power-law of the form $\zeta=\zeta_0 \rho^\nu$. The
analytic expression of the density contrast (obtained for $\nu=1/2$) shows
that, for small values of the constant $\zeta_0$, its behavior is not
significantly different from the non-viscous one derived by E.M. Lifshitz. But
as soon as $\zeta_0$ overcomes a critical value, the growth of the density
contrast is suppressed forward in time by the viscosity and the stability of
the Universe is favored in the expanding picture. On the other hand, in such a
regime, the asymptotic approach to the initial singularity (taken at $t=0$) is
deeply modified by the apparency of significant viscosity in the primordial
thermal bath i.e. the isotropic and homogeneous Universe admits an unstable
collapsing picture. In our model this feature regards also scalar perturbations
while in the non-viscous case it appears only for tensor modes.

invariance of the $D=4+n$-dimensional spacetime is lost due to the compactified
nature of the $n$ dimensions leaving invariance only in 4d. In such theories
other sources of Lorentz violation may exist associated with the physics that
initiated the compactification process at high scales. Here we consider the
possibility of capturing some of this physics by analyzing the higher
dimensional analog of the model of Colladay and Kostelecky. In that scenario a
complete set of Lorentz violating operators arising from spontaneous Lorentz
violation, that are not obviously Planck-scale suppressed, are added to the
Standard Model action. Here we consider the influence of the analogous set of
operators which break Lorentz invariance in 5d within the Universal Extra
Dimensions picture. We show that such operators can greatly alter the
anticipated Kaluza-Klein(KK) spectra, induce electroweak symmetry breaking at a
scale related to the inverse compactification radius, yield sources of parity
violation in, e.g., 4d QED/QCD and result in significant violations of
KK-parity conservation produced by fermion Yukawa couplings, thus destabilizing
the lightest KK particle. LV in 6d is briefly discussed.

case where the orbifold is S^1/(Z_2xZ_2). We do not presume the existence of
fields with support only at fixed points. As in the familiar case of (rigid)
super-Yang-Mills theories on such orbifolds, only bulk hypermultiplets can lead
to chiral multiplets in complex representations of the gauge group on the
boundaries. Massless chiral multiplets coming from bulk vector or tensor
multiplets can potentially be used as Higgs supermultiplets, though a
""doublet-triplet"" splitting via parity assignments is not available for the
tensor sector. We also find parity assignments for objects other than fields
that appear in the Lagrangian, which will partially determine the structure of
interactions of the boundary theories. Assigning odd parities to the scalar
sector of vector/tensor multiplets requires the four-dimensional boundary
moduli spaces to lie on the boundary of the classical Kaehler cone, which
corresponds to collapsed Calabi-Yau 2-cycles at the orbifold fixed points in a
compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity. There is an ambiguity in
how to effect odd parity for the field-independent C_(IJK) tensor of the 5D

collapsing to either 2- or 0-cycles.

permits only a global identification of the total input power, usually from a

then describe a model antenna consisting of two perfectly conducting

the driving oscillatory electric field. The fields and surface current are
determined by solution of the boundary value problem. In contrast to the first
approach (not a boundary value problem), the tangential electric field vanishes
on the metallic surface. There is no radial Poynting vector normal to the

the highest possible value. At high antigen presentation there is a decrease in
tumor size to some value when the dynamical equilibrium between the tumor and
the immune system is reached. In the case of the medium antigen presentation
both these regimes can be realized depending on the initial tumor size and the
condition of the immune system. A pronounced immunomodulating effect (the
suppression of tumor growth and the normalization of IL-2 concentration) is
established by considering the influence of low-intensity electromagnetic
microwaves as a parametric perturbation of the dynamical system. This finding
is in qualitative agreement with the recent experimental results on
immunocorrective effects of centimeter electromagnetic waves in tumor-bearing
mice.

amount of local or marginal ({\em i.e.}referring to the subsystems) entropy.
For mixed states this identification vanishes, since the global loss of
information about the state makes it impossible to distinguish between quantum
and classical correlations. Here we show how the joint knowledge of the global
and marginal degrees of information of a quantum state, quantified by the
purities or in general by information entropies, provides an accurate
characterization of its entanglement. In particular, for Gaussian states of
continuous variable systems, we classify the entanglement of two--mode states
according to their degree of total and partial mixedness, comparing the
different roles played by the purity and the generalized $p-$entropies in
quantifying the mixedness and bounding the entanglement. We prove the existence
of strict upper and lower bounds on the entanglement and the existence of
extremally (maximally and minimally) entangled states at fixed global and
marginal degrees of information. This results allow for a powerful, operative
method to measure mixed-state entanglement without the full tomographic
reconstruction of the state. Finally, we briefly discuss the ongoing extension
of our analysis to the quantification of multipartite entanglement in highly
symmetric Gaussian states of arbitrary $1 \times N$-mode partitions.

case of pure Bloch states. In fact, the exact version of the acceleration
theorem should contain a phase factor depending on both the time and crystal
momentum variables. As we show this phase factor plays an essential role in
order to understand the motion of Bloch Oscillators in the position variable.

  lattices","12 pages, RevTeX",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.72.042335",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the detection and characterization of entanglement based on
the quantum network introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 110501 (2004)] for
different experimental scenarios. We first give a detailed discussion of the
ideal scheme where no errors are present and full spatial resolution is
available. Then we analyze the implementation of the network in an optical
lattice. We find that even without any spatial resolution entanglement can be
detected and characterized in various kinds of states including cluster states
and macroscopic superposition states. We also study the effects of detection
errors and imperfect dynamics on the detection network. For our scheme to be
practical these errors have to be on the order of one over the number of
investigated lattice sites. Finally, we consider the case of limited spatial
resolution and conclude that significant improvement in entanglement detection
and characterization compared to having no spatial resolution is only possible
if single lattice sites can be resolved.

  Courteille","Dimensional Crossover in Bragg Scattering from an Optical Lattice","4 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.72.031402",,"quant-ph",,"  We study Bragg scattering at 1D optical lattices. Cold atoms are confined by
the optical dipole force at the antinodes of a standing wave generated inside a
laser-driven high-finesse cavity. The atoms arrange themselves into a chain of
pancake-shaped layers located at the antinodes of the standing wave. Laser
light incident on this chain is partially Bragg-reflected. We observe an
angular dependence of this Bragg reflection which is different to what is known
from crystalline solids. In solids the scattering layers can be taken to be
infinitely spread (3D limit). This is not generally true for an optical lattice
consistent of a 1D linear chain of point-like scattering sites. By an explicit
structure factor calculation we derive a generalized Bragg condition, which is
valid in the intermediate regime. This enables us to determine the aspect ratio
of the atomic lattice from the angular dependance of the Bragg scattered light.
