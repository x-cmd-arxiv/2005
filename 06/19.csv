interesting features that require a better understanding of gas-thermodynamic
processes and feedback effects related to reionization and galaxy formation. In
galaxy clusters, the abundance of dwarf galaxies is in good agreement with the
expectation based on the subhalo mass function, whereas in galaxy groups, the
relatively small abundance of dwarfs conflicts with theoretical expectations.
In all halo systems, there is a dip in the abundance of galaxies with
luminosities in the range ~ 2x10^8 L_sun to 10^10 L_sun, corresponding to
subhalo mass scales between ~ 5x10^10 M_sun to few times 10^11 M_sun.
Photoionization from reionization has been used to explain statistics of the
dwarf population, with larger systems forming prior to, and smaller systems
forming subsequent to, reionization. The observed dip in the LF is an imprint
of small dwarf galaxies (<2x10^8 L_sun) that formed prior to reionization. The
galactic winds powered by supernovae in these dwarf galaxies propagate energy
and metals to large distances such that the intergalactic medium is uniformly
enriched to a level of 10^-3 zsun, as observed in the low-redshift Ly-alpha
forest. The associated energy related to this metallicity raises the
intergalactic medium temperature and the Jeans mass to a range 10^10-10^11
M_sun at z ~ 3.4-6.0. Because the epoch of nonlinearity for halos in this mass
range is at z > 3.4-4.4, their gas content, hence star formation, is greatly
suppressed on average and leads to a dip in the observed LF at $z=0$. Larger
halos (M > 10^11 M_sun), becoming nonlinear at z < 3.4-4.4, have masses topping
the Jeans mass, where subhalo mass function based LF is again in agreement with
observations.

X-1 from five different epochs, using Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S and
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data. The X-ray spectrum consistently shows two distinct
components, a hard power law and a soft blackbody with kT_BB ~ 0.18 keV. For
all five epochs the hard component shows a simple double-peaked pulse shape,
and also a variation in the power law slope, which becomes harder at maximum
flux and softer at minimum flux. For the soft component, the pulse profile
changes between epochs, in both shape and phase relative to the power law
pulses. The soft component is likely produced by reprocessing of the hard X-ray
pulsar beam by the inner accretion disk. We use a model of a twisted inner
disk, illuminated by the rotating X-ray pulsar beam, to simulate pulsations in
the soft component due to this reprocessing. We find that for some disk and
beam geometries, precession of an illuminated accretion disk can roughly
reproduce the observed long-term changes in the soft pulse profiles.

towards the formation of the optically thick core, the magnetic flux density

approaches 1.5 (n/5 times 10^10 cm^-3)^1/2 mG, while if the core is

magnetized cloud are studied with use of three-dimensional MHD nested-grid
simulations. After the isothermal runaway collapse, an adiabatic gas forms a
protostellar first core at the center of the cloud. When the isothermal gas is
stable for fragmentation in a contracting disk, the adiabatic core often breaks
into several fragments. Conditions for fragmentation and binary formation are
studied. All the cores which show fragmentations are geometrically thin, as the
diameter-to-thickness ratio is larger than 3. Two patterns of fragmentation are
found. (1) When a thin disk is supported by centrifugal force, the disk
fragments through a ring configuration (ring fragmentation). This is realized
in a fast rotating adiabatic core as Omega >0.2 tau_ff^-1, where Omega and
tau_ff represent the angular rotation speed and the free-fall time of the core,
respectively. (2) On the other hand, the disk is deformed to an elongated bar
in the isothermal stage for a strongly magnetized or rapidly rotating cloud.
The bar breaks into 2 - 4 fragments (bar fragmentation). Even if a disk is
thin, the disk dominated by the magnetic force or thermal pressure is stable
and forms a single compact body. In either ring or bar fragmentation mode, the
fragments contract and a pair of outflows are ejected from the vicinities of
the compact cores. The orbital angular momentum is larger than the spin angular
momentum in the ring fragmentation. On the other hand, fragments often quickly
merge in the bar fragmentation, since the orbital angular momentum is smaller
than the spin angular momentum in this case. Comparison with observations is
also shown.

sandwiched by these two regimes. The classical transition is described by the
Ising universality class. However, the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson scheme breaks
down when the quantum effects dominate. The marginal quantum critical region is
categorized to a new universality class, where the order parameter exponent
beta, the susceptibility exponent gamma and the field exponent delta are given
by beta=d/2, gamma=2-d/2 and delta=4/d, respectively, with d being the spatial

the numerically obtained stabilized solution has different configuration than

clear evidence for stabilization in a strict sense, because in the numerical
experiments only metastable (slowly decaying) solutions have been obtained. In
other words, neither numerical nor mathematical evidence for a new kind of
soliton solutions have been revealed so far. The existence of the metastable

dynamics simulations. Utilizing previous experimental observations of the solid
phase behavior of these monolayers, this study investigates the temperature
dependence of the phases and phase transitions in these three monolayers during
the solid-fluid phase transition, and compares the observed melting behavior to
previous studies of hexane and butane monolayers. In particular, this study
seems to indicate a greater dependence of the melting transition on the
formation of gauche defects in the alkyl chains as the chain length is
increased. In light of the previously proposed footprint reduction mechanism
and variations where the formation of gauche defects are energetically negated,
simulations seem to suggest that decane and dodecane monolayers are generally
equally as dependent upon the formation of gauche defects for the melting
transition to take place, whereas octane monolayers seem to have less
dependence, but follow a trend that is established in previous studies of
melting in butane and hexane monolayers. Also, the phase transition from a
solid herringbone phase into an orientationally ordered intermediate phase is
found to exhibit some differences as compared to a recent study of hexane
monolayers, which may be interpreted as originating from the greater influence
of gauche defects. Comparison to experimental melting temperatures is provided

elements coincides with the Hodge structure induced from the fundamental torsor
of path of punctured affine line.

loopless and with no more than one edge between any two nodes). Such graphs are
fundamental to the theory of knots and links in three dimensional space, and
their planar diagrams. We dedicate this paper to Frank Harary (1921 -- 2005)
whose fascination with graphs of knots inspired this work and with whom we had
the pleasure of developing this paper. We prove that for v (the number of
nodes) greater than or equal to 8 there always exist such knot-graphs. Our
proof gives rise to a class of ""tight"" graphs that do not submit to the
recursive procedure that generates graphs with v+2 nodes from ""admissible""
graphs with v nodes. We then classify such tight graphs.

  and period polynomials","AMS-LaTeX, 45 pages; v2, trimmed content",,,,"math.NT",,"  Let S_{w+2} be the vector space of cusp forms of weight w+2 on the full
modular group, and let S_{w+2}^* denote its dual space. Periods of cusp forms
can be regarded as elements of S_{w+2}^*. The Eichler-Shimura isomorphism
theorem asserts that odd (or even) periods span S_{w+2}^*. However, periods are
not linearly independent; in fact, they satisfy the Eichler-Shimura relations.
This leads to a natural question: which periods would form a basis of
S_{w+2}^*.
  First we give an answer to this question. Passing to the dual space S_{w+2},
we will determine a new basis for S_{w+2}. The even period polynomials of this
basis elements are expressed explicitly by means of Bernoulli polynomials.
  Next we consider three spaces--S_{w+2}, the space of even Dedekind symbols of
weight w with polynomial reciprocity laws, and the space of even period
polynomials of degree w. There are natural correspondences among these three
spaces. All these spaces are equipped with compatible action of Hecke
operators. We will find explicit form of period polynomials and the actions of
Hecke operators on the period polynomials.
  Finally we will obtain explicit formulas for Hecke operators on S_{w+2} in
terms of Bernoulli numbers B_k and divisor functions sigma_k(n), which are
quite different from the Eichler-Selberg trace formula.

some HNN-extensions of these along cyclic subgroups and the fundamental group
of a certain closed hyperbolic 3-manifold.

frequencies the differential light shift of the clock states vanishes and the
measurement is non-perturbing. In dense samples the measurement can be used to
squeeze the collective clock pseudo-spin, and has potential to improve the
performance of atomic clocks and interferometers.

  691-728.",,,"quant-ph",,"  In relation of observable and quantum state, the entity $I_C$ from previous
work quantifies simultaneously coherence, incompatibility and quantumness. In
this article its application to quantum correlations in bipartite states is
studied. It is shown that Zurek's quantum discord can always be expressed as
excess coherence information (global minus local). Strong and weak zero-discord
cases are distinguished and investigated in terms of necessary and sufficient
and sufficient conditions respectively. A unique string of relevant subsystem
observables, each a function of the next, for ""interrogating"" the global state
about the state of the opposite subsystem is derived with detailed entropy and
information gain discussion. The apparent disappearance of discord in
measurement is investigated, and it is shown that it is actually shifted from
between subsystems 1 and 2 to between subsystems 1 and $(2+3)$, where 3 is the
measuring instrument. Finally, it is shown that the global coherence
information $I_C(A_2,\rho_{12})$ is shifted into the global coherence
information $I_C(A_2,\rho_{123}^f)$ in the final state $\rho_{123}^f$ of the
measurement interaction.
