  Colloquium No. 227, 2005, ""Massive Star Birth: A Crossroads of Astrophysics""",,"10.1017/S1743921305004710",,"astro-ph",,"  Stars form by gravoturbulent fragmentation of interstellar gas clouds. The
supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in Galactic molecular gas generates
strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most
massive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.
  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at
the same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately
linked to the dynamic behavior of parental gas clouds, which governs when and
where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via
accretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. The equation
of state plays a pivotal role in the fragmentation process. Under typical cloud
conditions, massive stars form as part of dense clusters following the ""normal""
mass function observed, e.g. in the solar neighborhood. However, for gas with
an effective polytropic index greater than unity star formation becomes biased
towards isolated massive stars. This is relevant for understanding the
properties of zero-metallicity stars (Population III) or stars that form under
extreme environmental conditions like in the Galactic center or in luminous
starbursts.

mass-radius relationships. The secondary star has the mass, radius, luminosity
and photometric temperature of an M2 star, but a spectroscopic temperature of
M4. The latter may well be due to a high metallicity. There is a troubling
inconsistency between the radius of the white dwarf inferred from its
gravitational redshift and inclination and that inferred from its temperature,
flux, and astrometric distance.
  We find that there are two fundamental limits to the accuracy of the
parameters we can derive. First the radial velocity curve of the secondary star
deviates from a sinusoid, in part because of its asphericity (which can be
modelled) and in part because the line flux is not evenly distributed over its
surface. Second we cannot be certain which spectral type is the best match for
the lines of the secondary star, and the derived rotational velocity is a
function of the spectral type of the template star used.

fall-off for the first few hundred seconds, followed by a less rapid decline

decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model, we do two tests respectively. First,
using different criteria, we generate four sets of QSO-galaxy pairs and find
there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in
$\log(1+z)$, or at any other frequency. We then check the relationship between
high redshift QSOs and nearby active galaxies, and we find the distribution of
projected distance between high redshift QSOs and nearby active galaxies and
the distribution of redshifts of those active galaxies are consistent with a
distribution of simulated random pairs, completely different from Bell's
previous conclusion. We also analyze the periodicity in redshifts of QSOs, and
no periodicity is found in high completeness samples, contrary to the DIR
model. These results support that QSOs are not ejected from active galaxies.

cosmological scenarios. From these a variety of datasets is selected imitating
the observational conditions of either the volume-limited LS mimicking NBG
catalog or the deeper magnitude-limited PSCz catalog. The mildly nonlinear
dynamics in the mock NBG and PSCz velocities are analyzed by means of an
optimized implementation of the Least Action Principle, the Fast Action Method

affected by the external forces. Most of the external forces can be traced back
to a depth of no more than 100Mpc/h. This is concluded from the fact that the
FAM reconstructions of the 100Mpc/h PSCz volume appear to have included most
gravitational influences. In addition, we demonstrate that for all considered

rich galaxy clusters, likely the descendants of an intergalactic stellar
population found in recent years through a variety of tracers. We estimate the
observational signatures of the associated SN remnants (SNRs) in the unusual
intracluster medium (ICM) environment. If SNe-Ia still have a circumstellar
medium (CSM) at the time of explosion, then their remnants are visible in the
optical for ~100-1000 years, with properties similar to young galactic SNRs. In
contrast with galactic SNRs, in which the ejecta from the explosion interacts
with the ISM, intracluster SNRs become undetectable in the optical once their
ejecta passes beyond the CSM and enters the hot and tenuous ICM. If SNe-Ia have
a CSM, there should be ~150 young SNRs in the Virgo cluster, with
L(H-alpha)~10^{35} erg/s and angular size ~0.1''. We investigate the
possibility that members of this SNR population may have recently been
detected, but incorrectly identified as intergalactic HII regions.
Alternatively, if optical intergalactic SNRs do not exist in Virgo, this will
be evidence that SNe-Ia are devoid of a CSM, with implications for progenitor
scenarios. Regardless of the presence of a CSM, about 10 older radio SNRs per
square degree should be detectable in Virgo, with fluxes of ~0.1 mJy at 1 GHz.
Their angular sizes, morphologies, and lack of optical association with distant
galaxies can distinguish them from the much more numerous background
population. Their detection would provide a measurement of the intracluster SN
rate. Observations toward the site of SN1980I, a possibly intergalactic Virgo
SN-Ia, can test the existence of a CSM by comparison to our early-time
predictions for intergalactic SNR development.

Coulomb barrier problem and propose a simple phenomenological formula for the
reaction rate which covers all cases. The parameters of this formula can be
varied, taking into account current theoretical uncertainties in the reaction
rate. The results are illustrated for the example of the ^{12}C+^{12}C fusion
reaction. This reaction is very important for the understanding of nuclear
burning in evolved stars, in exploding white dwarfs producing type Ia
supernovae, and in accreting neutron stars. The S-factor at stellar energies
depends on a reliable fit and extrapolation of the experimental data. We
calculate the energy dependence of the S-factor using a recently developed

be explained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering picture in terms
of the interplay between the properties of the merging histories and the
feedback/star-formation processes in the progenitors of local galaxies. Using a
semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, we compute the color
distributions of galaxies with different luminosities and compare them with the
observations. Our fiducial model matches the fundamental properties of the
observed distributions, namely: 1) the distribution of objects brighter than
M_r = -18 is clearly bimodal, with a fraction of red objects increasing with
luminosity; 2) for objects brighter than M_r = -21 the color distribution is
dominated by red objects with color u-r = 2.2-2.4; 3) the spread on the
distribution of the red population is smaller than that of the blue population;
4) the fraction of red galaxies is larger in denser environments, even for
low-luminosity objects; 5) the bimodality in the distribution persists up to z
= 1.5. We discuss the role of the different physical processes included in the
model in producing the above results.

Parallel with anti-ferromagnetism is then drawn and frustration of rotation is

electrons in thermionic and thermoelectric devices to be engineered in ways
that were not previously possible. Here we show that the shape of the electron
energy spectrum in these devices has a significant impact on their performance.
We distinguish between traditional thermionic devices where electron momentum
is filtered in the direction of transport only and a second type, in which the
electron filtering occurs according to total electron momentum. Such 'total
momentum filtered' kr thermionic devices could potentially be implemented in,
for example, quantum dot superlattices. It is shown that whilst total momentum
filtered thermionic devices may achieve efficiency equal to the Carnot value,
traditional thermionic devices are limited to efficiency below this. Our second
main result is that the electronic efficiency of a device is not only improved
by reducing the width of the transmission filter as has previously been shown,
but also strongly depends on whether the transmission probability rises sharply
from zero to full transmission. The benefit of increasing efficiency through a
sharply rising transmission probability is that it can be achieved without
sacrificing device power, in contrast to the use of a narrow transmission
filter which can greatly reduce power. We show that devices which have a
sharply-rising transmission probability significantly outperform those which do
not and it is shown such transmission probabilities may be achieved with
practical single and multibarrier devices. Finally, we comment on the
implications of the effect the shape of the electron energy spectrum on the

coupled via a shared voltage gate consisting of a nanomechanical resonator.
Working in the regime where the resonator can be treated as a classical system,
we find that the SETs act on the resonator like two independent heat baths. The
coupling to the resonator generates positive correlations in the currents
flowing through each of the SETs as well as between the two currents. In the
regime where the dynamics of the resonator is dominated by the back-action of
the SETs, these positive correlations can lead to parametrically large
enhancements of the low frequency current noise. These noise properties can be
understood in terms of the effects on the SET currents of fluctuations in the
state of a resonator in thermal equilibrium which persist for times of order
the resonator damping time.

interaction between pacemakers via their phase response curves. This model
describes a network of pulse oscillators coupled by their response to the
internal depolarization of mutual stimulations.
  First, a macroscopic level corresponding to an arbitrary large number of
oscillatory elements coupled globally is considered. As a specific and
important case of the proposed model, the bidirectional interaction of two
cardiac nodes is described. This case is generalized by means of an additional
pacemaker, which can be expounded as an external stimulater. The behavior of
such a system is analyzed. Second, the microscopic level corresponding to the
representation of cardiac nodes by one-- and two--dimensional lattices of pulse
oscillators coupled via the nearest neighbors is described. The model is a
universal one in the sense that on its basis one can easily construct discrete
distributed media of active elements, which interact via phase response curves.

radial flow patterns with Au+Au data is one of the main lines of evidence
suggesting the nearly perfect fluid properties of the strongly coupled Quark
Gluon Plasma, sQGP, produced at RHIC. We study the sensitivity of this
conclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions on chemical and thermal
freezeout after the sQGP hadronizes. We show that if chemical freezeout occurs
at the hadronization time, the differential elliptic flow for pions increase
with proper time in the late hadronic phase until thermal freezeout and leads
to a discrepancy with the data. In contrast, if both chemical and thermal
equilibrium are maintained past the hadronization, then the mean pT per pion
increases in a way that accidentally preserves v2(pT) from the sQGP phase in
agreement with the data, but at the cost of the agreement with the hadronic
yields. In order that all the data on hadronic ratios, radial flow, and
differential elliptic flow be reproduced, the sQGP must expand with a minimal
viscosity, \eta_Q, that is however even greater than the viscosity, \eta_H, of
its hadronic corona. However, because of the large entropy density difference
of the two phases of QCD matter, the larger viscosity in the sQGP phase leads
to nearly perfect fluid flow while the smaller entropy density of the hadronic
corona strongly hinders the applicability of Euler hydrodynamics. The ``perfect
fluid'' property of the sQGP is thus not due to a sudden reduction of the
viscosity at the critical temperature Tc, but to a sudden increase of the
entropy density of QCD matter and is therefore an important signature of
deconfinement.

quark couplings to $\sigma$- and $\omega$-meson fields are determined to fit
the nuclear saturation properties. However, the coupling constant $g_\sigma^s$
between the $s$-quark and the $\sigma$-meson cannot be fixed from the
saturation properties, and thus we treat $g_\sigma^s$ as a free parameter and
investigate how $\mtheta^*$ depends on $g_\sigma^s$. %$\mtheta^*$ is calculated
up to 2.5 times the nuclear saturation density, %and we find that We find that
$\mtheta^*$ depends significantly on the value of $g_\sigma^s$ but not on the

  Results: Taking into account the absence of a significantly large yeast EST
database, we use microarray expression data collected for genomic regions
erroneously believed to be coding to study the expression pattern of non-coding
regions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We find that at least 164 out
of 589 (28%) such regions are expressed under specific biological conditions.
In particular, looking at the probes that are located opposing other known
genes at the same genomic locus, we find that 88 out of 341 (26%) of these
genes support antisense transcription. The expression patterns of these
antisense genes are positively correlated. We validate these results using
RT-PCR on a sample of 6 non-coding transcripts.
  Conclusions: 1. The yeast genome is transcribed on a scale larger than

continuous variable systems. We first review the formalism of Gaussian measures
of entanglement, adopting the framework developed in [M. M. Wolf {\em et al.},
Phys. Rev. A {\bf 69}, 052320 (2004)], where the Gaussian entanglement of
formation was defined. We compute Gaussian measures explicitely for two
important families of nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states, namely the states
of extremal (maximal and minimal) negativities at fixed global and local
purities, introduced in [G. Adesso {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92},
087901 (2004)]. This allows us to compare the {\em orderings} induced on the
set of entangled two--mode Gaussian states by the negativities and by the
Gaussian entanglement measures. We find that in a certain range of global and
local purities (characterizing the covariance matrix of the corresponding
extremal states), states of minimum negativity can have more Gaussian
entanglement than states of maximum negativity. Thus Gaussian measures and
negativities are definitely inequivalent on nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian
states (even when restricted to extremal states), while they are completely
equivalent on symmetric states, where moreover the Gaussian entanglement of
formation coincides with the true one. However, the inequivalence between these
two families of continuous-variable entanglement measures is somehow limited.
In fact we show rigorously that, at fixed negativities, the Gaussian
entanglement measures are bounded from below, and we provide strong evidence
that they are also bounded from above.

relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil group of quantum
optics. Complete sets of MUBs of cardinality d+1 have been derived for prime
power dimensions d=p^m using the tools of abstract algebra. Presumably, for non
prime dimensions the cardinality is much less. Here we reinterpret MUBs as
quantum phase states, i.e. as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators
generalizing those introduced by Pegg & Barnett in 1989. We relate MUB states
to additive characters of Galois fields (in odd characteristic p) and to Galois
rings (in characteristic 2). Quantum Fourier transforms of the components in
vectors of the bases define a more general class of MUBs with multiplicative
characters and additive ones altogether. We investigate the complementary
properties of the above phase operator with respect to the number operator. We
also study the phase probability distribution and variance for general pure
quantum electromagnetic states and find them to be related to the Gauss sums,
which are sums over all elements of the field (or of the ring) of the product
of multiplicative and additive characters. Finally, we relate the concepts of
mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement. This allows to use well studied
algebraic concepts as efficient tools in the study of entanglement and its
information aspects

the general case within standard quantum mechanical formalism or within
theories of nonlocal (superluminal) hidden variables. It is shown too that
within theories of nonlocal hidden variables but not in the standard quantum
mechanical formalism a paradox appears in the situation when one of the
correlated subsystems arrives at a Schwarzschild black hole. Namely, there is
no way that black hole horizon obstructs superluminal influences between spin
of the subsystem without horizon and spin of the subsystem within horizon,or
simply speaking,there is none black hole horizon nor ""no hair"" theorem for
subsystems with correlated spins. It implies that standard quantum mechanical
formalism yields unique consistent and complete description of the quantum

  II. Solution of Krein equation","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A reference potential approach to the one-dimensional quantum-mechanical
inverse problem is developed. All spectral characteristics of the system,
including its discrete energy spectrum, the full energy dependence of the phase
shift, and the Jost function, are expected to be known. The technically most
complicated task in ascertaining the potential, solution of a relevant integral
equation, has been decomposed into two relatively independent problems. First,
one uses Krein method to calculate an auxiliary potential with exactly the same
spectral density as the initial reference potential, but with no bound states.
Thereafter, using Gelfand-Levitan method, it is possible to introduce, one by
one, all bound states, along with calculating another auxiliary potential of
the same spectral density at each step. For the system under study (diatomic
xenon molecule), the kernel of the Krein integral equation can be accurately
ascertained with the help of solely analytic means. At small distances the
calculated auxiliary potential with no bound states practically coincides with
the initial reference potential, which is in full agreement with general
theoretical considerations. Several possibilities of solving the Krein equation
are proposed and the prospects of further research discussed.

unravel the linear structure of Hilbert spaces into several constituents. Some
prove to be very crucial for particular features of quantum theory while others
obstruct the passage to a formalism which is not saturated with physically
insignificant global phases.
  First we show that the bulk of the required linear structure is purely
multiplicative, and arises from the strongly compact closed tensor which,
besides providing a variety of notions such as scalars, trace, unitarity,
self-adjointness and bipartite projectors, also provides Hilbert-Schmidt norm,
Hilbert-Schmidt inner-product, and in particular, the preparation-state
agreement axiom which enables the passage from a formalism of the vector space
kind to a rather projective one, as it was intended in the (in)famous Birkhoff
& von Neumann paper.
  Next we consider additive types which distribute over the tensor, from which
measurements can be build, and the correctness proofs of the protocols
discussed in quant-ph/0402130 carry over to the resulting weaker setting. A
full probabilistic calculus is obtained when the trace is moreover linear and
satisfies the \em diagonal axiom, which brings us to a second main result,
characterization of the necessary and sufficient additive structure of a both
qualitatively and quantitatively effective categorical quantum formalism
without redundant global phases. Along the way we show that if in a category a
(additive) monoidal tensor distributes over a strongly compact closed tensor,
then this category is always enriched in commutative monoids.
