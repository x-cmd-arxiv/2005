gravitational instability criterion. A detailed account of the integrated
ionizing radiation and mechanical luminosity as a function of time is here
shown to lead to a new stationary solution. In this, the mass deposition rate

observed so far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and
post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron, followed by a
gradual flux decrease in the months after. The measured time-averaged energy

is the most appropriate tool for quantifying our knowledge when it changes
through the acquisition of new data. The cosmographic approach helps to sort
out the models in which the universe was always accelerating from those in
which it decelerated for at least some time in the period of interest. Bayesian
model comparison technique is used to discriminate these rival hypotheses with
the aid of recent releases of supernova data. We also attempt to provide and
improve another example of Bayesian model comparison, performed between some
Friedmann models, using the same data. Our conclusion, which is consistent with

a methodology for determining the properties of this region by studying such a

  Using solar data we illustrate how the signal from the helium ionization zone
can be isolated. Using solar models with different physics -- theory of
convection, equation of state and low temperature opacities -- we establish how
the characteristics of the signal depend on the different aspects contributing
to the structure in the ionization layer. We further discuss how the method can
be used to measure the solar helium abundance in the envelope and to constrain

supermassive black holes (SMBHs), M_bh, and the velocity dispersion sigma or
mass M_sph of their host spheroid, place interesting constraints on the process
that regulates SMBH growth in galaxies. When combined with the observed
properties of early-type SDSS galaxies, the observed intrinsic scatters imply
that SMBH growth is regulated by the spheroid velocity dispersion rather than
its mass. The M_bh-M_sph relation is therefore a by-product of a more
fundamental M_bh-sigma relation. We construct a theoretical model for the
scatter among baryon modified dark matter halo profiles, out of which we
generate a population of spheroid hosts and show that these naturally lead to a
relation between effective radius and velocity dispersion of the form R_sph ~
sigma^1.5 with a scatter of ~0.2dex, in agreement with the corresponding
projection of the fundamental plane for early type galaxies in SDSS. At the
redshift of formation, our model predicts the minimum scatter that SMBHs can
have at fixed velocity dispersion or spheroid mass under different formation
scenarios. We also estimate the additional scatter that is introduced into
these relations through collisionless mergers of purely stellar spheroids at
z<1. We find that the observed scatter in the M_bh-sigma and M_bh-M_sph
relations preclude the properties of dark matter halos from being the governing
factor in SMBH growth. Finally, we show that SMBH growth governed by the
properties of the host spheroid can lead to the observed values of scatter in
the M_bh-sigma and M_bh-M_sph relations, only if the SMBH growth is limited by
momentum or energy feedback over the dynamical time of the host spheroid.

period lasting ~ 6 cycles during the latter half of May 2. The phase indicates
that the modulation may be due to a combination of emission by a hot spot on
the disc and X-ray heating of the secondary. The emission generally trended
bluer with B-I decreasing by 0.6 magnitudes during the observations but there
were anomalous changes in colour during the first few days after optical
identification when the I band flux decreased slightly while fluxes in other
bands increased. Spectral analysis of the BVRI broadband photometry show
evidence of a variable excess in the R and I bands. We suggest that this may be
due to synchrotron emission in matter flowing out of the system and note that
similar processes may have been responsible for anomalous V and I band

Frequency decreases from 7x10^{-4} Hz to 10^{-5} Hz, while the spectral slope
of the soft band power law component is independent of the Fourier frequency.
The well known broad Fe Ka feature is absent at all frequency bins; this result
implies that this feature is not variable on time scales shorter than ~10^5
sec, in agreement with recent line variability studies. Strong spectral
features are also present in the soft X-ray band (at E~0.7), clearly
discernible in all Fourier Frequency bins. This fact is consistent with the

the intense UV radiation field of the young massive star. Modeling of the

a prominent line-like feature in the observed 3-4 keV range is inferred from
both photometric and spectroscopic techniques. It indicates an X-ray spectrum
dominated by 6.4 keV Fe K emission and the presence of a Compton-thick AGN. Our
estimate of the luminosity of the illuminating source (L(2-10keV)>=1e45 erg/s),
required to produce the observed Fe K emission in reflection from cold matter,
means that the hidden quasar nucleus accounts for a significant fraction of the
large bolometric luminosity. The soft X-ray emission below 2 keV is found to be
spatially extended and probably of a separate origin. The temperature and
bolometric luminosity (kT=2 keV and L(bol,CL)=1e44 erg/s) obtained from a
thermal spectrum place this X-ray source on the L-Tx relation of galaxy
clusters. The possible association with a galaxy cluster can be added to the

exposed to a central X-ray source. The models are applied to the massive
star-forming region AFGL 2591 for different X-ray fluxes. The total X-ray
ionization rate is dominated by the `secondary' ionization rate of H2 resulting
from fast electrons. The carbon, sulphur and nitrogen chemistries are
discussed. It is found that He+ and H3+ are enhanced and trigger a peculiar
chemistry. Several molecular X-ray tracers are found and compared to tracers of
the far ultraviolet (FUV) field. Like ultraviolet radiation fields, X-rays
enhance simple hydrides, ions and radicals. In contrast to ultraviolet photons,
X-rays can penetrate deep into the envelope and affect the chemistry even at
large distances from the source. Whereas the FUV enhanced species cover a
region of 200-300 AU, the region enhanced by X-rays is >1000 AU. Best-fit
models for AFGL 2591 predict an X-ray luminosity LX > 1e+31 ergs/s with a hard
X-ray spectrum TX > 3e+07 K. Furthermore, we find LX/Lbol ~ 1e-6. The chemistry
of the bulk of the envelope mass is dominated by cosmic-ray induced reactions
rather than by X-ray induced ionization for X-ray luminosities LX < 1e+33
ergs/s. The calculated line intensities of HCO+ and HCS+ show that high-J lines
are more affected than lower J lines by the presence of X-rays due to their
higher critical densities, and that such differences are detectable even with
large aperture single-dish telescopes. Future instruments such as Herschel-HIFI
or SOFIA will be able to observe X-ray enhanced hydrides whereas the
sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA is well-suited to measure the size

shows that the [SII] line profile is double-peaked, implying that the low
excitation jet is seen at a small angle (probably larger than 8 degrees) with
respect to the plane of the sky. The width of the H_alpha line suggests a
dominating contribution from the accretion columns and from the shocks on the
stellar surface. Unresolved H_alpha emission coming from an object located at
4.2"" from Par-Lup3-4 is detected at a position angle ~30 degrees or ~210

blueshifted with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) of the molecular

accretion, is required to account for their unusually low luminosities.

Our analysis shows that Te(He I) values are significantly lower than electron
temperatures deduced from the Balmer jump of H I recombination spectra, Te(H

expansion of the fermionic field operator where modes, in addition to space

interaction parameters are derived by a fully-analytical calculation. The
special interest for this derivation resides in its model-generating capability
and in the flexibility of the trapping techniques that allow the tuning of the
Hamiltonian interaction parameters over a wide range of values. While the
Hubbard Hamiltonian is recovered in a very low-density regime for a fermionic
system, in general, far more complicated Hamiltonians characterise high-density
regimes, revealing a rich scenario for both the phenomenology of interacting
trapped fermions and the experimental realization of devices for quantum
information processing. As a first example of the different situations that may
arise beyond the models well known in the literature (the unpolarized-spin
fermion model and the noninteracting spin-polarized fermion model), we derive a
Rotational Hubbard Hamiltonian describing the local rotational activity of
spin-polarized fermions. Based on a standard techniques we obtain the
mean-field version of our model Hamiltonian and show how different dynamical

exact critical behavior at the transition into a magnon crystal state, the
universal value of the entropy at the saturation field, and the position of
peaks in temperature- and field-dependence of the specific heat. Analogous
mapping is presented for the sawtooth chain, which is mapped onto a model of

Ti ions. The superexchange Hamiltonian includes, in addition to the isotropic
Heisenberg coupling, antisymmetric (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) and symmetric
anisotropy terms, caused by the spin-orbit interaction on the Ti ions. We find
ferromagnetic Heisenberg couplings for Ti-Ti bonds in the crystallographic ab
planes, but antiferromagnetic ones for Ti-Ti bonds between planes, in
contradiction with experiment (which gives ferromagnetic couplings for both).
Difficulties in calculating realistic values for the isotropic couplings of
YTiO3 have been already reported in the literature. We discuss possible origins
for these discrepancies. However, the much smaller values we obtain for the
symmetric and antisymmetric anisotropies may be expected to be reliable. We
therefore combine the experimentally-deduced isotropic coupling with the
calculated anisotropic ones to determine the magnetic order of the Ti ions,
which is found to be in satisfactory agreement with experiment. Based on this
magnetic order, we derive the spin-wave spectrum. We find an acoustic branch
with a very small zone-center gap and three optical spin-wave modes with
sizeable zone-center gaps. The acoustic branch reproduces the one reported in

black hole that has been previously studied by several workers. Our approach to
compactification is based on dimensional reduction with respect to the
stationary Killing vector, resulting in three-dimensional gravity coupled to a
nonlinear sigma model. Using that the original non-compactified solution
corresponds to a target space geodesic, the problem can be linearized much in
the same way as in the case of no electric nor NUT charge. An interesting
feature of the solution family is that for nonzero electric charge but
vanishing NUT charge, the solution has a curvature singularity on a torus that
surrounds the event horizon, but this singularity is removed when the NUT
charge is switched on. We also treat the Schwarzschild case in a more complete
way than has been done previously. In particular, the asymptotic solution (the
Levi-Civita solution with the height coordinate made periodic) has to our
knowledge only been calculated up to a determination of the mass parameter. The
periodic Levi-Civita solution contains three essential parameters, however, and
the remaining two are explicitly calculated here.

on topics of interest to a physics audience. Astronomers have discovered dozens
of compact objects with masses greater than 3 solar masses, the likely maximum

Some of the candidates have masses of 5 to 20 solar masses and are found in
X-ray binaries, while the rest have masses from a million to a billion solar
masses and are found in galactic nuclei. A variety of methods are being tried
to estimate the spin parameters of the candidate black holes. There is strong
circumstantial evidence that many of the objects have event horizons. Recent
MHD simulations of magnetized plasma accreting on rotating black holes seem to
hint that relativistic jets may be produced by a magnetic analog of the Penrose

confirm the momentum shift imposed by these boundary conditions and in addition
demonstrate that they do not introduce any appreciable noise. We therefore
advocate the use of partially twisted boundary conditions in applications where
good momentum resolution is necessary.

observed particles, the perturbative limit with characteristic back-to-back
correlation is recovered. As the trigger momenta get closer to the saturation
scale Q_s, the angular distribution broadens. When the momenta are
significantly smaller than Q_s, the azimuthal distribution is broad but still
peaked back-to-back. However, in a narrow momentum range (0.5 - 1.5) Q_s, we
observe that the azimuthal correlation splits into a double peak with maxima
displaced away from 180 degree. We argue that it is the soft multiple
scattering physics that is responsible for the appearance of this shift in the
angle of maximal correlation. We also point out that when the physical size of
the projectile is particularly small, the double peak structure persists in a
significantly wider range of final state momenta.

propagation is consistent with unitarity. This quantization corresponds to the
quantization of the black hole angular momentum, as expected from the dual CFT
description. Note, however, that we recover this result by analyzing the
physics inside the horizon and near the singularity. The spacetime under
consideration has no AdS boundary, and we are therefore not using any
assumption regarding a possible dual formulation. We perform the computation at
very low energies, where string effects are irrelevant and interactions are

all closed string moduli at leading order in \alpha^{'} by introducing
consistently fluxes. As usual we consider the dilaton and the complex structure
moduli stabilized by turning on three-form fluxes that couple to the F-part of
the scalar potential. Kahler moduli get fixed by the combined action of the
flux-induced scalar masses with magnetic fields of the open string sector, and
Fayet-Illiopoulos terms. For supersymmetric three-form fluxes the model is N=1,
otherwise the mass terms are the scalar soft breaking terms of the SM fields.
For the case of imaginary self dual three-form fluxes (ISD), the mass terms are
positive and the minimum at the potential is at exactly zero energy. We argue
that, under generic assumptions, this is a general mechanism for the full
stabilization of closed string moduli. The vacua depend explicitly on the
fluxes introduced in the manifold. A concrete realization of this mechanism on
type IIB on a (T^ {6}/Z_{2}xZ_{2}) orientifold is provided.

J. Algebraic Geom., to appear",,,,"math.AC math.AG",,"  We study the arithmetic properties of projective varieties of almost minimal
degree, that is of non-degenerate irreducible projective varieties whose degree
exceeds the codimension by precisely 2. We notably show, that such a variety $X

Gorenstein) or a projection of a variety of minimal degree $\tilde {X} \subset
{\mathbb P}^{r + 1}$ from an appropriate point $p \in {\mathbb P}^{r + 1}
\setminus \tilde {X}$. We focus on the latter situation and study $X$ by means
of the projection $\tilde {X} \to X$.
  If $X$ is not arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, the homogeneous coordinate ring
$B$ of the projecting variety $\tilde {X}$ is the endomorphism ring of the
canonical module $K(A)$ of the homogeneous coordinate ring $A$ of $X.$ If $X$
is non-normal and is maximally Del Pezzo, that is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay
but not arithmetically normal $B$ is just the graded integral closure of $A.$
It turns out, that the geometry of the projection $\tilde {X} \to X$ is
governed by the arithmetic depth of $X$ in any case.
  We study in particular the case in which the projecting variety $\tilde {X}
\subset {\mathbb P}^{r + 1}$ is a cone (over a) rational normal scroll. In this
case $X$ is contained in a variety of minimal degree $Y \subset {\mathbb P}^r$
such that $\codim_Y(X) = 1$. We use this to approximate the Betti numbers of
$X$.

screening technique that combines high radiation penetration with very good
sensitivity and specificity to nitrogenous explosives. The method is
particularly well-suited to inspection of large, massive objects (since the
incident gamma-ray probe is at 9.17 MeV) such as aviation and marine
containers, heavy vehicles and railroad cars. Two kinds of gamma-ray detectors
have been employed to date in GRA systems: 1) Resonant-response nitrogen-rich
liquid scintillators and 2) BGO detectors. This paper analyses and compares the
response of these detector-types to the resonant radiation, in terms of
single-pixel figures of merit. The latter are sensitive not only to detector
response, but also to accelerator-beam quality, via the properties of the
nuclear reaction that produces the resonant gamma-rays. Generally, resonant
detectors give rise to much higher nitrogen-contrast sensitivity in the
radiographic image than their non-resonant detector counterparts and
furthermore, do not require proton beams of high energy-resolution. By
comparison, the non-resonant detectors have higher gamma-detection efficiency,
but their contrast sensitivity is very sensitive to the quality of the
accelerator beam. Implications of these detector/accelerator characteristics
for eventual GRA field systems are discussed.

is enhanced at backward angles by several percent, increasing with Q^2. This
gives rise to a small, ~3% suppression of G_E/G_M obtained from the

two-photon exchange effects with data on the ratio of e^+ p to e^- p cross

recombination probability, if the interference between amplitudes of quark
recombination with different momenta is neglected. The recombination
probability is determined by the hadron's wavefunction in the constituent quark
model. The shower diquark or triquark distribution functions of a fragmenting
jet are defined in terms of overlapping matrices of constituent quarks and
parton field operators. They are similar in form to dihadron or trihadron
fragmentation functions in terms of parton operator and hadron states.
Extending the formalism to the field theory at finite temperature, we
automatically derive contributions to the effective single hadron fragmentation
function from the recombination of shower and thermal constituent quarks. Such
contributions involve single or diquark distribution functions which in turn
can be related to diquark or triquark distribution functions via sum rules. We
also derive QCD evolution equations for quark distribution functions that in

partition $[4]_{orb}(0s^4)[31]^{\sigma f}$, four of $J^{\pi}={1/2}^+$ with $4q$
partition $[31]_{orb}(0s^30p)[4]^{\sigma f}$ and seven of $J^{\pi}={1/2}^+$
with $4q$ partition $[4]_{orb}(0s^30p)[31]^{\sigma f}$. Some modifications are
made in this further study, i.e., the orbital wave function is extended as an
expansion of 4 different size harmonic oscillator forms; three various forms
(quadratic, linear and error function form) of the color confinement potential
are considered; the states with $4q$ partition $[4]_{orb}(0s^30p)[31]^{\sigma
f}$ are added, which are unnegligible in the $J^{\pi}={1/2}^+$ case and were
not considered in our previous paper, further the mixing between configurations
$[31]_{orb}(0s^30p)[4]^{\sigma f}$ and $[4]_{orb}(0s^30p)[31]^{\sigma f}$ is
also investigated. The results show that the T=0 state is still always the
lowest one for both $J^{\pi}={1/2}^-$ and $J^{\pi}={1/2}^+$ states, and
$J^{\pi}={1/2}^-, T=0$ state is always lower than that of $J^{\pi}={1/2}^+$.
All of these modifications can only offer several tens to hundred MeV effect,
and the theoretical value of the lowest state is still about 245 MeV higher
than the experimental mass of $\Theta^+$. It seems to be difficult to get the
calculated mass close to the observed one with the reasonable parameters in the

membranes. Membranes form insulating structures and the channels through them
allow and control the movement of charged particles, spherical ions, mostly
Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl-. Membranes contain hundreds or thousands of types of
channels, fluctuating between open conducting, and closed insulating states.
Channels control an enormous range of biological function by opening and
closing in response to specific stimuli using mechanisms that are not yet
understood in physical language. Open channels conduct current of charged
particles following laws of Brownian movement of charged spheres rather like
the laws of electrodiffusion of quasi-particles in semiconductors. Open
channels select between similar ions using a combination of electrostatic and
'crowded charge' (Lennard-Jones) forces. The specific location of atoms and the
exact atomic structure of the channel protein seems much less important than
certain properties of the structure, namely the volume accessible to ions and
the effective density of fixed and polarization charge. There is no sign of
other chemical effects like delocalization of electron orbitals between ions
and the channel protein. Channels play a role in biology as important as
transistors in computers, and they use rather similar physics to perform part
of that role. Understanding their fluctuations awaits physical insight into the
source of the variance and mathematical analysis of the coupling of the
fluctuations to the other components and forces of the system.

has bearings on many broader issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics as
well. In this scenario a quantum measurement is a non-equilibrium phase
transition in a ``resonant cavity'' formed by the entire physical universe
including all of its material and energy content. A quantum measurement
involves the energy and matter exchange among not only the system being
measured and the measuring apparatus but also the global environment of the
universe resonant cavity, which together constrain the nature of the phase
transition. Strict realism, including strict energy and angular momentum
conservation, is recovered in this view of the quantum measurement process
beyond the limit set by the uncertainty relations, which are themselves derived
from the exact commutation relations for quantum conjugate variables. Both the
amplitude and the phase of the quantum mechanical wavefunction acquire
substantial meanings in the new ontology, and the probabilistic element is
removed from the foundations of quantum mechanics, its apparent presence in the
quantum measurement being solely a result of the sensitive dependence on
initial/boundary conditions of the phase transitions of a many
degree-of-freedom system which is effectively the whole universe. Vacuum
fluctuations are viewed as the ``left over'' fluctuations after forming the
whole numbers of nonequilibrium resonant modes in the universe cavity. This new
view on the quantum processes helps to clarify many puzzles in the foundations

allow for trap geometries with microwave cut-off frequencies high enough to

complete control of both external and internal degrees of freedom over very
long times. Trapping is achieved using carefully designed electric fields,
created by a simple pattern of electrodes. We show that it is possible to
excite, and then trap, one and only one Rydberg atom from a cloud of ground
state atoms confined on a magnetic atom chip, itself integrated with the
Rydberg trap. Distinct internal states of the atom are simultaneously trapped,
providing us with a two-level system extremely attractive for atom-surface and
atom-atom interaction studies. We describe a method for reducing by three
orders of magnitude dephasing due to Stark shifts, induced by the trapping
field, of the internal transition frequency. This allows for, in combination
with spin-echo techniques, maintenance of an internal coherence over times in
the second range. This method operates via a controlled light shift rendering
the two internal states' Stark shifts almost identical. We thoroughly identify
and account for sources of imperfection in order to verify at each step the
realism of our proposal.

  solutions is known","6 pages, No Figure, Latex 2e",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Grover's search algorithm searches a database of $N$ unsorted items in
$O(\sqrt{N/M})$ steps where $M$ represents the number of solutions to the
search problem. This paper proposes a scheme for searching a database of $N$
unsorted items in $O(logN)$ steps, provided the value of $M$ is known. It is
also shown that when $M$ is unknown but if we can estimate an upper bound of
possible values of $M$, then an improvement in the time complexity of
conventional Grover's algorithm is possible. In that case, the present scheme
reduces the time complexity to $O(MlogN)$.

  interferometry","4 pages, 15 June 2005",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.011603",,"quant-ph",,"  We have built an atom interferometer and, by applying an electric field on
one of the two interfering beams, we have measured the static electric
polarizability of lithium with a 0.66 % uncertainty. Our experiment is similar
to an experiment done on sodium in 1995 by D. Pritchard and co-workers, with
several improvements: the electric field can be calculated analytically and our
phase measurements are very accurate. This experiment illustrates the extreme
sensitivity of atom interferometry: when the atom enters the electric field,
its velocity increases and the fractional change, equal to 4 x 10^(-9) for our
largest field, is measured with a 10^(-3) accuracy.

of plaintext states $P$. Specifically, we determine all achievable states
$\rho^{(0)}$ (average output of encryption) and for each particular set $P$ we
determine the entropy of the key necessary and sufficient to encrypt this set.
It turns out that single bit of key is sufficient when the set $P$ is two
dimensional. However, the necessary and sufficient entropy of the key in case
of three dimensional $P$ varies continuously between 1 and 2 bits depending on
the state $\rho^{(0)}$. Finally, we derive private quantum channels achieving
these bounds. We show that the impossibility of universal NOT operation on
qubit can be derived from the fact that one bit of key is not sufficient to
encrypt qubit.

means of inconclusive photon subtraction (IPS) on a squeezed vacuum state
$S(r)\ket{0}$. The IPS process can be characterized by two parameters: the IPS
transmissivity $\tau$ and the photodetection quantum efficiency $\eta$. We
found that the conditional state approaches the squeezed Fock state
$S(r)\ket{1}$ when $\tau,\eta \to 1$, i.e., in the limit of single-photon
subtraction. For non-unit IPS transmissivity and efficiency, the conditioned
state remains close to the target state, {\em i.e.} shows a high fidelity for a
wide range of experimental parameters. The nonclassicality of the conditional
state is also investigated and a nonclassicality threshold on the IPS
parameters is derived.
