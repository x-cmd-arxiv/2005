GW source and travels towards the Earth, where it is detected. While traveling
in the field of the GW, the light acquires specific phase modulation (which we
account in the eikonal approximation). This phase modulation can be considered
as a coherent spreading of the given initial photons energy over a set of
satellite lines, spaced at the frequency of GW (from quantum point of view it
is multi-graviton absorption and emission processes). This coherent state of
photons with the energy distributed among the set of equidistant lines, can be
analyzed and identified on Earth either by passing the signal through a
Fabry-Perot filter or by monitoring the intensity-intensity correlations at
different times.

Within the 2x2 GHz bandpasses (lower and upper sidebands, 337.2-339.2GHz and
347.2-349.2GHz), we find about 145 spectral lines from 13 species, 6
isotopologues, and 5 vibrational excited states. Most nitrogen-bearing
molecules are strong toward the hot core, whereas the oxygen-bearing molecules
peak toward the south-west in the so-called compact ridge. Imaging of spectral
lines is shown to be an additional tool to improve the identifications of
molecular lines. Arcsecond spatial resolution allows us to distinguish the
molecular line emission of the sources I and n from that of the hot core. The
only molecular species detected strongly toward source I is SiO, delineating
mainly the collimated north-east south-west low-velocity outflow. The two
positions close to source I, which have previously been reported to show maser
emission in the v=0 28SiO(1-0) and (2-1) lines, show no detectable maser
emission in the v=0 28SiO(8-7) line at our spatial resolution. SiO is weak
toward source n, and thus source n may not currently be driving a molecular
outflow. CH$_3$OH is the molecule with the highest number of identified lines
(46) in this spectral window. This ``line forest'' allows us to estimate
temperatures in the region, and we find temperatures between 50 and 350K, with
the peak temperatures occurring toward the hot core. The detection of strong
vibrational excited line emission from the submm continuum peak SMA1 supports
the interpretation that the source SMA1 is likely of protostellar nature.

B1828-11 vary periodically with a period of 500 days. This behavior can be
accounted for by precession of the radiopulsar, an interpretation that is
reinforced by the detection of variations in its pulse profile on the same
timescale. Here, we model the period residuals from PSR B1828-11 in terms of
precession of a triaxial rigid body. We include two contributions to the
residuals: (i) the geometric effect, which arises because the times at which
the pulsar emission beam points toward the observer varies with precession
phase; (ii) the spindown contribution, which arises from any dependence of the
spindown torque acting on the pulsar on the angle between its spin and magnetic
axes. We use the data to probe numerous properties of the pulsar, most notably
its shape, and the dependence of its spindown torque on the angle between its
spin and magnetic axes, for which we assume a sum of a spin-aligned component
(with a weight 1-a) and a dipolar component perpendicular to the magnetic beam
axis (weight a), rather than the vacuum dipole torque (a=1). We find that a
variety of shapes are consistent with the residuals, with a slight statistical
preference for a prolate star. Moreover, a range of torque possibilities fit
the data equally well, with no strong preference for the vacuum model. In the
case of a prolate star we find evidence for an angle-dependent spindown torque.
Our results show that the combination of geometrical and spin-down effects
associated with precession can account for the principal features of PSR
B1828-11's timing behavior, without fine tuning of the parameters.

are 600 km/s, though most of the outflowing gas has lower velocities (100-200
km/s). (One galaxy has velocities exceeding 1000 km/s.) Velocities in LINERs
are higher than in HII galaxies, and outflowing ionized gas often has higher
velocities than the neutral gas. Wind properties (velocity, mass, momentum, and
energy) scale with galaxy properties (SFR, luminosity, and galaxy mass),
consistent with ram-pressure driving of the wind. Wind properties increase
strongly with increasing galactic mass, contrary to expectation. These
correlations flatten at high SFR (> 10-100 M_sun/yr), luminosities, and masses.
This saturation is due to a lack of gas remaining in the wind's path, a common
neutral gas terminal velocity, and/or a decrease in the efficiency of
thermalization of the supernovae energy. It means that mass entrainment
efficiency, rather than remaining constant, declines in galaxies with SFR > 10
M_sun/yr and M_K < -24. Half of our sample consists of ULIRGs, which host as
much as half of the star formation in the universe at z > 1. The powerful,

a low-mass star under the observed conditions in the Virgo IC medium. We find
that the integrated hydrogen-recombination line emission of a PN is dominated
by the inner dense shell, whose evolution is unaffected by the environment. Ram
pressure stripping affects mainly the outermost IC PN shell, which hardly
influences the emission when the PN is observed as a point source. More
importantly, we find that a PN with progenitor mass of 1 Msun fades to ~30% and
10% of its maximum emission, in 5,000 and 10,000 yr respectively, disclosing an
actual PN lifetime t_PN several times shorter to what is usually adopted
(25,000 yr). This result affects the theoretical calculation of the
luminosity-specific density of IC PNe, which scales with t_PN. For t_PN=10,000
yr, our more conservative estimate, we obtain that the luminosity-specific
density of PNe is in fair agreement with the value obtained from Red Giants.

does not substantially degrade dark energy information, uncertainties in both
parameters do. For a fiducial next-generation survey each would need to be
known to better than about 0.003-0.01 in redshift for each interval in order to
lead to less than a factor of 1.5 increase in the dark energy parameter errors.
The more stringent requirement corresponds to a larger dark energy parameter

kinematics of objects that formed within early (z > 10) protogalactic systems
(old stars, satellite galaxies, globular clusters, massive black holes, etc.)
depends mostly on the rarity of the peak of the primordial density field which
they originally belonged to. Only for objects forming at lower redshifts the
exact formation site within the progenitor halo (e.g. whether near the center
or in an extended disk) becomes important. In present-day haloes, material from
the rarer early peaks is more centrally concentrated and falls off more steeply
with radius compared to the overall mass distribution, it has a lower velocity
dispersion, moves on more radial orbits, and has a more elongated shape.
Population II stars that formed within protogalactic haloes collapsing from
>2.5 sigma fluctuations would follow today a r^{-3.5} density profile with a
half-light radius of 17 kpc and a velocity anisotropy that increases from
isotropic in the inner regions to nearly radial at the halo edge. This agrees
well with the radial velocity dispersion profile of Galaxy halo stars from

number, on the dynamics of dark matter haloes forming in the context of

relaxation to the case when the size and mass distribution are variable, and
parametrising the time evolution using established empirical relations, we find
that the dynamics of a million particle halo is noise-dominated within the
inner percent of the final virial radius. Far larger particle numbers (~ 10^8)
are required for the RMS perturbations to the velocity to drop to the 10 %
level there. The radial scaling of the relaxation time is simple and strong:
t_relax ~ r^2, implying that numbers >> 10^8 are required to faithfully model
the very inner regions; artificial relaxation may thus constitute an important
factor, contributing to the contradictory claims concerning the persistence of
a power law density cusp to the very centre. The cores of substructure haloes
can be many relaxation times old. Since relaxation first causes their expansion

to disrupt, depending on their orbital parameters. It may thus modify the
characteristics of the subhalo distribution and effects of interactions with
the parent. We derive simple closed form formulas for the characteristic
relaxation times, as well as for the weak N-scaling reported by Diemand et al.
when the main contribution comes from relaxing subhaloes (abridged).

dark matter are considered at various scales in the Universe. We treat the
general situations for the gravity from Newtonian to general relativity and the
degeneracy from nonrelativistic to relativistic. A dimensionless equilibrium
configuration is specified by a single parameter regardless of particle
properties, the Fermi velocity at the center, and the scalings of mass and
length are specified by the rest mass and statistical weight of the dark matter
particle. We focus our attention to the flat-top nature of the mass column
density profile of the cluster of galaxies, A1689, recently reported by
Broadhurst et al. using gravitational lensing. We convert the column density
profile to a volume density profile assuming spherical symmetry and derive a 3D
encircled mass profile of A1689, which is compared with the model profiles of
degenerate fermion structures. The flat-top profile is reproduced. The
corresponding fermion mass ranges from 2 eV to 30 eV depending on the actual
scale of the degenerate structure. If massive neutrinos are the dominant dark
matter, the rest mass will be about 4.7 or 2.3 eV respectively for Majorana or
Dirac neutrinos. The mass and size of the degenerate structure are
$10^{14}M_\odot$ and 100 kpc for Majorana neutrinos, and
5$\times10^{14}M_\odot$ and 300 kpc for Dirac neutrinos. If we identify the
fermions as heavier sterile neutrinos, they yield the characteristic mass
hierarchy of black holes; giant black hole at the center of a galaxy and the
intermediate mass black holes. Thus we propose the possibility that the mass
hierarchy of fermions determines that of black holes in the Universe.

by Nozawa et al. (2003) (N03), we constructed a model of dust emission from
forming galaxies on the basis of the theoretical framework of Takeuchi et al.
(2003) (T03). N03 showed that the produced dust species depends strongly on the
mixing within SNe. We treated both unmixed and mixed cases and calculated the
infrared (IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) of forming galaxies for both
cases. Our model SED is less luminous than the SED of T03 model by a factor of
2-3. The difference is due to our improved treatment of UV photon absorption
cross section, as well as different grain size and species newly adopted in
this work. The SED for the unmixed case is found to have an enhanced near to
mid-IR (N-MIR) continuum radiation in its early phase of the evolution (age <
10^{7.25} yr) compared with that for the mixed case. The strong N--MIR
continuum is due to the emission from Si grains, which only exist in the
species of the unmixed dust production. We also calculated the IR extinction
curves for forming galaxies. Then we calculated the SED of a local starbursting
dwarf galaxy SBS 0335-052. Our present model SED naturally reproduced the
strong N--MIR continuum and the lack of cold FIR emission of SBS 0335-052. We
found that only the SED of unmixed case can reproduce the NIR continuum of this
galaxy. We then made a prediction for the SED of another typical star-forming
dwarf, I Zw 18. We also presented the evolution of the SED of LBGs. Finally, we

between two parallel plates and sheared via a relative motion of the two plates
are studied by extensive Brownian dynamics computer simulations. The
charge-stabilized suspension is modeled by a Yukawa pair potential. The
unsheared equilibrium configuration are two crystalline layers with a nested
quadratic in-plane structure. For increasing shear rates $\dot \gamma$, we find
the following steady states: first, there is a static solid which is
elastically sheared until a yield-stress limit is reached. Then there are two
crystalline layers sliding on top of each other with a registration procedure.
Higher shear rates melt the crystalline bilayers and even higher shear rates
lead to a reentrant solid stratified in the shear direction. This qualitative
scenario is similar to that found in previous bulk simulations. We have then
studied the relaxation of the sheared steady state back to equilibrium after an
instantaneous cessation of shear and found a nonmonotonic behavior of the
typical relaxation time as a function of the shear rate $\dot \gamma$. In
particular, application of high shear rates accelerates the relaxation back to
equilibrium since shear-ordering facilitates the growth of the equilibrium
crystal. This mechanism can be used to grow defect-free colloidal crystals from
strongly sheared suspensions. Our theoretical predictions can be verified in
real-space experiments of strongly confined charged suspensions.

disorder generated by random dilution which does not vary with the time. In
practice, if a SF network is to represent, for example, the worldwide web, then
the links between its various nodes may temporarily be lost, and re-established
again later on. This gives rise to SF networks with annealed disorder. Even if
the disorder is quenched, it may be more realistic to generate it by a
dynamical process that is happening in the network. In this paper, we study
diffusion in SF networks with annealed disorder generated by various scenarios,
as well as in SF networks with quenched disorder which, however, is generated
by the diffusion process itself. Several quantities of the diffusion process
are computed, including the mean number of distinct sites visited, the mean
number of returns to the origin, and the mean number of connected nodes that
are accessible to the random walkers at any given time. The results including,
(1) greatly reduced growth with the time of the mean number of distinct sites
visited; (2) blocking of the random walkers; (3) the existence of a phase
diagram that separates the region in which diffusion is possible from one in
which diffusion is impossible, and (4) a transition in the structure of the
networks at which the mean number of distinct sites visited vanishes, indicate
completely different behavior for the computed quantities than those in SF
networks with quenched disorder generated by simple random dilution.

electron momentum as the variable parameter. In type I plot, the trajectory
closes upon itself only when the ratio $R$ of the arm lengths (of the
interferometer) is a rational fraction, the shape and the type of the generated
flower-like pattern is sensitive to the electron momentum. For momenta
corresponding to discrete eigenstates of the perfect ring (i.e. the ring
without the leads), the trajectory passes through the origin a certain fixed
number of times before closing upon itself, whereas for arbitrary momenta it
never passes through the origin. Although the transmission coefficient is
periodic in the flux with the elementary flux quantum as the basic period, the
phenomenon of electron transmission is shown not to be so when analyzed via the
present technique. The periodicity is seen to spread over several flux units
whenever $R$ is a rational fraction whereas there is absolutely no periodicity
present when $R$ is an irrational number. In type II plot, closed trajectories
passing through the origin a number of times are seen for $R$ being a rational
fraction. The case R=1 (i.e. a symmetric ring) with zero flux is rather
pathological--it presents a closed loop surrounding the origin. For irrational

consider the case of non-zero density QCD. It is suggested that the

constrains the form of corrections to the pseudo-Goldstone Higgs potential,

the subject, a brief non-specialist introduction to the basic tools employed in

subsequently defined and the application to the case of photons and spin 1/2
fermions is described. The resulting modified Maxwell and Dirac Hamiltonians,
leading in particular to Planck scale corrections in the energy-momentum
relations, are presented. Alternative interpretations of the results and their
limitations, together with other approaches are briefly discussed along the

convex cone alternatives for correlated data is developed. While there exists
extensive theory for hypothesis testing under smooth cone alternatives with
independent observations, extension to correlated data under general convex
cone alternatives remains an open problem. This long-pending problem is
addressed by (1) establishing that a ""generalized quasi-score"" statistic is
asymptotically equivalent to the squared length of the projection of the
standard Gaussian vector onto the convex cone and (2) showing that the
asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is a weighted chi-squared
distribution, where the weights are ""mixed volumes"" of the convex cone and its
polar cone. Explicit expressions for these weights are derived using the
volume-of-tube formula around a convex manifold in the unit sphere.
Furthermore, an asymptotic lower bound is constructed for the power of the
generalized quasi-score test under a sequence of local alternatives in the
convex cone. Applications to testing under order restricted alternatives for
correlated data are illustrated.

This construction can be thought of as a uniqueness theorem for Schubert's
`satellite operations.' We identify precisely which graphs are companionship
graphs of knots and links respectively. We also describe how a large family of
operations on knots and links affects companionship graphs. This family of
operations is called `splicing' and includes, among others, the operations of:

we `enumerate' the components via the companionship trees associated to the
knot. The knots with the simplest companionship trees are: the unknot, torus
knots, and hyperbolic knots. The homotopy-type of these components of K were
computed by Hatcher. In the case the companionship tree has height, we give a
fibre-bundle description of those components of K, recursively, in terms of the
homotopy types of `simpler' components of K, in the sense that they correspond
to knots with shorter companionship trees. The primary case studied in this
paper is the case of a knot which has a hyperbolic manifold contained in the
JSJ-decomposition of its complement.

may not be mutually consistent in light of rigorous formulations of the
Markovian approximation. Namely, Markovian dynamics requires either the
singular coupling limit (high temperature), or the weak coupling limit (weak
system-bath interaction). The former is incompatible with the assumption of a
constant and fresh supply of cold ancillas, while the latter is inconsistent
with fast gates. We discuss ways to resolve these inconsistencies. As part of
