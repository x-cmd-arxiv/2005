Using the well developed regularization approach we analyze the energy
dependency of spectral index for a high resolution energy spectrum provided by
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The regularization
technique produces much smoother derivatives while avoiding additional errors
typical of finite differences. It is shown that observations imply a spectral
index varying significantly with energy, in a way that also varies with time as
the flare progresses. The implications of these findings are discussed in the

radial velocity measurements, including globular clusters, satellite galaxies,
field blue horizontal branch stars and red giant stars from the Spaghetti
survey. The new data lead to a significant increase in the number of known
objects for Galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc, which allows a reliable
determination of the radial velocity dispersion profile out to very large
distances. The radial velocity dispersion shows an almost constant value of 120
km/s out to 30 kpc and then continuously declines down to 50 km/s at about 120
kpc. This fall-off puts important constraints on the density profile and total
mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. For a constant velocity
anisotropy, the isothermal profile is ruled out, while both a dark halo
following a truncated flat model of mass $1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$

allowed a more precise determination of the Milky Way mass in comparison to
previous works. We also show how different assumptions for the velocity
anisotropy affect the performance of the mass models.

initiated a search for theoretical arguments supporting the empirical

understanding of the origin of the observed diversity in type Ia supernova
properties is needed. Here we present a first systematic study of effects
resulting from changing some physical parameters of three-dimensional
deflagration models of thermonuclear supernovae. In our study we vary the
progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio and its central density prior to ignition
because both properties are not well determined by stellar evolution theory and
they may change from supernova to supernova. Next we compute for these
explosion models the nucleosynthesis yields in a post-processing step. This, in
addition, allows us to study variations in the progenitor's metallicity by
means of different $^{22}$Ne mass fractions in the initial composition. We find
that the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio and its central density affect the
energy release of the models and thus the expansion velocity of the supernova.
Moreover, we find that changing the metallicity and the central density changes
the production of radioactive $^{56}$Ni and thus affects the luminosity. In
contrast, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio has little effect on the $^{56}$Ni
production. Implications of the found variations of the explosion energy and
the produced $^{56}$Ni mass for the type Ia supernova diversity are discussed.

that the slope of the P-L relations for low metallicity and solar metallicity

appears to be significant disagreement between the observed slopes of the OGLE

indicating a possible intrinsic problem with the ISB method itself. Resolving

(absence of extraterrestrials and their manifestations from our past light

strategies employed by SETI projects so far. The need for such reevaluation is
fueled not only by the failure of searches thus far, but also by great advances
recently made in astrophysics, astrobiology, computer science and future
studies, which have remained largely ignored in SETI practice. As an example of
the new approach, we consider the effects of the observed metallicity and
temperature gradients in the Milky Way on the spatial distribution of
hypothetical advanced extraterrestrial intelligent communities. While,
obviously, properties of such communities and their sociological and
technological preferences are entirely unknown, we assume that (1) they operate
in agreement with the known laws of physics, and (2) that at some point they
typically become motivated by a meta-principle embodying the central role of
information-processing; a prototype of the latter is the recently suggested
Intelligence Principle of Steven J. Dick. There are specific conclusions of
practical interest to be drawn from coupling of these reasonable assumptions
with the astrophysical and astrochemical structure of the Galaxy. In
particular, we suggest that the outer regions of the Galactic disk are most
likely locations for advanced SETI targets, and that intelligent communities
will tend to migrate outward through the Galaxy as their capacities of
information-processing increase, for both thermodynamical and astrochemical
reasons. This can also be regarded as a possible generalization of the Galactic
Habitable Zone, concept currently much investigated in astrobiology.

relatively simple galaxy morphologies. The most successful methods are shown to
achieve percent level accuracy. From the cosmic shear pipelines that have been
used to constrain cosmology, we find weak lensing shear measured to an accuracy
that is within the statistical errors of current weak lensing analyses, with
shear measurements accurate to better than 7%. The dominant source of
measurement error is shown to arise from calibration uncertainties where the
measured shear is over or under-estimated by a constant multiplicative factor.
This is of concern as calibration errors cannot be detected through standard
diagnostic tests. The measured calibration errors appear to result from stellar
contamination, false object detection, the shear measurement method itself,
selection bias and/or the use of biased weights. Additive systematics (false
detections of shear) resulting from residual point-spread function anisotropy
are, in most cases, reduced to below an equivalent shear of 0.001, an order of
magnitude below cosmic shear distortions on the scales probed by current
surveys.

materials for rechargeable Li batteries. There is significant interest in their
electronic properties because of the importance of electronic conductivity in
batteries for high rate applications. The density of states of LixMPO4 (x = 0,
1 and M = Fe, Mn) has been determined with the ab initio GGA+U method,
appropriate for these correlated electron systems. Computed results are
compared with the optical gap of LiFePO4, as measured using UV-Vis-NIR diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy. The results obtained from experiment (3.8-4.0 eV) and
GGA+U computations (3.7 eV) are in very good agreement. However, standard GGA,
without the same level of treatment of electron correlation, is shown to make
large errors in predicting the electronic structure. It is argued that olivines
are likely to be polaronic conductors with extrinsically determined carrier
levels and that their electronic conductivity is therefore not simply related
to the band gap.

polymer is constrained to be fixed at both ends on one wall. We are not able to
find a closed form solution for the free energy for finite width, at all values
of the interaction parameters, but we can calculate the asymptotic behaviour
for large widths everywhere in the phase plane. This allows us to find the
force between the walls induced by the polymer and hence the regions of the

time-arguments on the contour. The effects of electron-electron interaction can
be taken systematically into account, as we illustrate by propagating the
Kadanoff-Baym equations for the second-order self-energy approximation. It is
important to use conserving approximations such that the evolution of the
electron density, momentum, and total energy agrees with the macroscopic
conservation laws. One of the main topics in this paper is the non-interacting
Green function, which is the relevant quantity for time-dependent density
functional theory. We discuss this Green function in detail, and show how the
Keldysh contour in a simple way allows us to derive the time-dependent
Kohn-Sham potential from an action functional. The formalism in a similar way
leads to response functions that obey the causality principle. To illustrate
these points, we discuss the time-dependent optimized effective potential

the relaxation of the primary constraints as extended to the quantum sector.
This requirement of the theory, relies on the assumption that a suitable time
variable exist, when taking the T-products of the dynamical variables. More
precisely, we start from the gravitational field equations written in the
Hamiltonian formalism and expressed via Misner-like variables; hence we
construct the equation to which the T-products of the dynamical variables obey
and transform this paradigm in terms of the generating functional, as taken on
the theory phase-space. We show how the relaxation of the primary constraints
(which correspond to break down the invariance of the quantum theory under the
4-diffeomorphisms) is summarized by a free functional taken on the Lagrangian
multipliers, accounting for such constraints in the classical theory. The issue
of our analysis is equivalent to a Gupta-Bleuler approach on the quantum
implementation of all the gravitational constraints; in fact, in the limit of
small $\hbar$, the quantum dynamics is described by a Schr\""odinger equation,
as soon as the mean values of the momenta, associated to the lapse function and
the shift vector, are not vanishing. Finally we show how, in the classical
limit, the evolutionary quantum gravity reduces to General Relativity in the
presence of an Eckart fluid, which corresponds to the classical counterpart of
the physical clock, introduced in the quantum theory.

consider the class of two-component BECs subject to laser-induced transitions
between the components. This system exhibits a complicated spectrum of normal
mode excitations, which can be viewed as two interacting phonon modes that
exhibit the phenomenon of ""refringence"". We study the conditions required to
make these two phonon modes decouple. Once decoupled, the two distinct phonons
generically couple to distinct effective spacetimes, representing a bi-metric
model, with one of the modes acquiring a mass. In the eikonal limit the massive
mode exhibits the dispersion relation of a massive relativistic particle: omega
= sqrt[omega_0^2 + c^2 k^2], plus curved-space modifications. Furthermore, it
is possible to tune the system so that both modes can be arranged to travel at
the same speed, in which case the two phonon excitations couple to the same
effective metric. From the analogue spacetime perspective this situation
corresponds to the Einstein equivalence principle being satisfied.

the basis of p+$\bar{\rm p}$(p) data and the strength of energy loss is
determined from RHIC Au+Au data. Uncertainties are discussed. With constraints
from RHIC data, we predict the $p_T$ spectra of hadrons in 5 % most central
Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy $\ssNN=5500$ GeV. Due to the closed

terms of the so-called generalized Fleming-Viot processes, which describe the
evolution of a population with fixed size, and are duals to the coalescents
with multiple collisions studied by Pitman and others. We first discuss
asymptotics when the initial size of the population tends to infinity. In that
setting, under appropriate hypotheses, we show that a rescaled version of the
generalized Fleming-Viot process converges weakly to a continuous-state
branching process. As a corollary, we get a hydrodynamic limit for certain
sequences of coalescents with multiple collisions: Under an appropriate
scaling, the empirical measure associated with sizes of the blocks converges to
a (deterministic) limit which solves a generalized form of Smoluchowski's
coagulation equation. We also study the behavior in small time of a fixed
coalescent with multiple collisions, under a regular variation assumption on
the tail of the measure $\nu$ governing the coalescence events. Precisely, we
prove that the number of blocks with size less than $\epsilon x$ at time
$(\epsilon\nu([\epsilon,1]))^{-1}$ behaves like
$\epsilon^{-1}\lambda\_1(]0,x[)$ as $\epsilon\to 0$, where $\lambda\_1$ is the
distribution of the size of one cluster at time 1 in a continuous-state
branching process with stable branching mechanism. This generalizes a classical
result for the Kingman coalescent.

anomalies, a consequence of string theory, an extension of inflation, and
conceptual issues in quantum mechanics. However, there appears to be no single
consistent formalism that addresses all the issues - it is not even clear if
the multiple universes interact or are accessible. Because of the absence of
clear evidence, it is easy to dismiss claims for multiple Universes, but it is
not that simple: Space-time geometries in a variety of forms are an established
aspect of physics, and history has shown that things which are not expressly
forbidden often appear at a later date. With this in mind, a new example of
possible multiple geometries is introduced to explain a difficult problem in
cosmology: Why are distant galaxies subject to the Hubble expansion but rulers
within our galaxy (and presumably, by the Cosmological Principle, all other
galaxies) do not appear to expand? There has actually been much debate in
recent years about whether local systems really are subject to the cosmological
expansion; we adopt the established view that local systems are not expanding
and investigate the transition condition where a mass may be part of the static
galactic system or participate in the expansion. We show that a remarkably
simple model based on coexisting spacetimes clarifies the situation and makes
quantative, testable cosmological predictions. The model is also testable
through Earth-based experiments.

would achieve such speeds by actually being stationary within a bubble of space
which itself was moving through space, the idea being that the speed of the
bubble was not itself limited by the speed of light. However that scenario
required exotic matter to stabilise the boundary of the bubble. Here that
proposal is re-examined within the context of the new modelling of space in
which space is a quantum system, viz a quantum foam, with on-going
classicalisation. This model has lead to the resolution of a number of
longstanding problems, including a dynamical explanation for the so-called
`dark matter' effect. It has also given the first evidence of quantum gravity
effects, as experimental data has shown that a new dimensionless constant
characterising the self-interaction of space is the fine structure constant.
The studies here begin the task of examining to what extent the new spatial
self-interaction dynamics can play a role in stabilising the boundary without
exotic matter, and whether the boundary stabilisation dynamics can be
engineered; this would amount to quantum gravity engineering.

to the classically compatible set of states of the object--meter system. It is
shown that the generalized measurement covers all the key known quantum
measurement concepts--standard projective, entangling, fuzzy and the
generalized measurement with the partial or complete destruction of the initial
information contained in the object. A special class of partially-destructive
measurements that map the continual set of the states in finite-dimensional
quantum systems to that one of the infinite-dimensional quantum systems is
considered. Their informational essence and some information characteristics
are discussed in detail.

quantum communication has an origin of indistinguishability of ensembles with
the same density matrix. We show that the two concepts are not related. We
argue that: 1) even with an ideal single-atom-precision measurement, it is
generally impossible to produce two ensembles with exactly the same density
matrix; or 2) to produce ensembles with the same density matrix, classical
communication is necessary. Hence the impossibility of faster-than-light
communication does not imply the indistinguishability of ensembles with the
same density matrix.
