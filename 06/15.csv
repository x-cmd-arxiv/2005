results for red sequence and blue cloud galaxies separately. The correlation
function of the red galaxies displays clear deviations from a power law at
comoving separations around 1 to 3 h^-1 Mpc, and similar but weaker trends are
suggested by the data for the blue galaxies. To interpret these results, we fit
the correlation functions with analytical predictions derived from a simple
halo occupation model. This combines linear clustering of the underlying mass
with a description of the number of galaxies occupying each dark-matter halo

simple power law with N proportional to M^alpha, then alpha ~ 0.5 and alpha ~
0.2 for red and blue galaxies respectively. These figures are little different
from the values required to fit present-day clustering data. The power-spectrum

determine the preferred value of sigma_8, the linear power-spectrum
normalization. The average normalization inferred from red and blue galaxies at

heat heavy ions preferentially. This is in contrast to the supernova data which

flux over the weekly timescales sampled by our observations. 2) A multi-
component model with an unocculted NLR and separate BLR and continuum
line-of-sight covering factors predicts saturation in several lines, consistent
with the lack of observed variability. 3) Column densities for the individual
metastable levels are measured from the resolved C III *1175 absorption complex
observed in one component. Based on our computed metastable level populations,
the electron density of this absorber is ~3x10^4 cm^-3. Photoionization
modeling results place it at ~25 pc from the central source. 4) Using
time-dependent calculations, we are able to reproduce the detailed variability
observed in this absorber, and derive upper limits on the distances for the
other components of 25-50 pc. 5) The ionization parameters derived for the

have similar pressures as the three X-ray ionization components. These results
are consistent with an inhomogeneous wind model for the outflow in NGC 3783. 6)

in models with large running where the error in the power spectrum can be at
the level of 1-2%. Most of this error comes from inaccuracy in the calculation
of the slope and not of the running or higher order terms. Second order
slow-roll does not improve the accuracy over first order. We also argue that in
the basis $\epsilon_0=1/H$, $\epsilon_{n+1}={d\ln|\epsilon_n|}/{dN}$,

several on-going studies attempting to constrain the ratio of high to low mass
stars, as well as stars to sub- stellar objects, in a variety of different
environments, all containing high mass stars.
  First, we examine the ratio of stars to sub--stellar objects in the nearby

forward for explaining the Pioneer anomaly is the gravitational acceleration of

also studied the hypothesis that drag forces can explain the the Pioneer

that they cannot be neglected with respect to metallicity effects. This

the ground (UBVRI, Halpha and Hbeta). We select ionizing stellar clusters
associated with HII regions of widely varying morphologies, and derive their
fundamental parameters from population synthesis fitting of their spectral
energy distributions, measured to eliminate local backgrounds accurately. From
these fits, we conclude that the stellar extinction law is highly variable in
the line of sight of young clusters of similar ages. In the particular model
geometry that we consider most appropriate to the sampled regions, we checked
that our findings are not significantly altered by the correct treatment of
radiative transfer effects. The variations are systematic in nature: extinction
laws of the Milky Way or LMC type are associated with compact HII regions (the
compacity being quantified in two different ways), while clusters surrounded by
diffuse HII regions follow extinction laws of the 30 Doradus or SMC type. The
Calzetti starburst attenuation law, although most often degenerate with the 30
Doradus extinction law, overpredicts ionizing photon fluxes by large amounts.
We also find that the extinction law variations are correlated with the column
density of dust species emitting in the near- and mid-infrared. Finally, we
briefly discuss the nebular to stellar extinction ratios, and the excitation of
aromatic band carriers, invalidating their claimed association with cold dust.

irregular boundaries, similar to observed H II regions. However, in observed H

combined with the three dimensional clumpy nature of the interstellar medium

shallow central slopes of the density profiles of dark matter halos in
galaxies. In order to be consistent with observational studies at scales of
galaxy clusters, the cross section should scale inversely with the velocity of
collision. In this paper we consider the mass density profile of the halo of
the low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy NGC 5963 to place an upper limit on the
dark matter cross section for collisions with velocities $\sim 150$ km
s$^{-1}$, i.e. at the low velocity regime. After calibrating against
cosmological simulations, we found that the large inferred dark matter
concentration and central dark matter density in NGC 5963 are inconsistent with
an effective collisional cross section per unit of mass >0.2 cm^2/g.
Corrections were applied in order to account for reduction of the core by the
adiabatic contraction caused by cooling baryons. Our limits that involve a
number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions, exclude the last
permitted interval for velocity-dependent cross sections to explain the flat
density core in LSB galaxies. Implications for the nature of dark matter are
also discussed.

vicinity of the Galaxy. The strongest absorption signatures within a few
hundred km/s of their rest-frame energies are most likely due to warm absorbing
outflows from the nearest AGN, which are back-lighting the local hot gas. We
emphasize that absorption signatures in the spectra of some distant AGN that
are kinematically consistent with the recessional velocity of the AGN are most
likely to be due to hot local gas. Along the sightline towards PG 1211+143, PDS
456 and MCG-6-30-15 there is a very large absorbing Fe column density which is
kinematically consistent with absorption by hot, local Fe. The sightlines to
these three AGN pass through the limb of the Northern Polar Spur (NPS), a local
bubble formed from several supernovae which, if rich in Fe, may account for a
large local Fe column.
  We obtain limits on the column density of local, highly ionized N, Ne, Mg, Si
along all of the sightlines in our sample. We correlate the column density
limits with those of highly ionized O along the same sightlines. Assuming the
hot local gas is in collisionally ionized equilibrium, we obtain limits on the
temperature and relative abundances of the metals in the hot local gas. Our
limits on the ionic column densities in the local hot gas seem to be consistent
with those observed in the hot halo gas of edge-on normal spiral galaxies.

independent of carbon nanotube diameter, but depends on the their chirality. On
the assumption of fixed bond lengths, (only flexible bond angle), the Poisson
ratio of all chirality tubes is obtained to be 1.When realistic flexibility of
bond lengths and bond angles is assumed, the Poisson ratio is between ~0 and
0.3, depending upon chirality. The present calculation of the Poisson ratio
does not require any detail of molecular interactions under the assumption of
either bond angle or bond length flexibility alone, but does depend on the
interaction potential if both are assumed flexible. Further, it has been found
that the Poisson ratio is sensitive to applied initial stress, varying
significantly when obtained under different initial stress values. It is
observed that Poisson ratio can be used to justify the interaction potential by
finding out the bond length flexibility in comparison to bond angle
flexibility.

the interfacial tension gamma in systems of hard and soft rods. For hard rods
with L/D=15, we obtain gamma ~ 1.4 kB T/L^2, with L the rod length, D the rod
diameter, T the temperature, and kB the Boltzmann constant. This estimate is in
good agreement with theoretical predictions, and the order of magnitude is
consistent with experiments.

With increasing $n$ from quarter filling, K_rho increases, and then exceeds 1/2

at an optimal density between quarter- and half-filling. These results are

include electroweak corrections, which, while generally subdominant, in some

completely specifies the set of finite-temperature form factors of general

important theoretical breakthrough in the last century. It is an essential
approach to analyze turbulence data present in meteorological, physical,
chemical, biological and mechanical phenomena. One of its very fundamental
assumptions is that turbulence is a stochastic Gaussian process in small
scales5. However, experiment data at finite Reynolds numbers have observed a
clear departure from the Gaussian. In this study, by replacing the standard
Laplacian representation of dissipation in the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation with
the fractional Laplacian, we obtain the fractional NS equation underlying the
Levy stable distribution which exhibits a non-Gaussian heavy trail and
fractional frequency power law dissipation. The dimensional analysis of this
equation turns out a new scaling of turbulences, called the Levy-Kolmogorov
scaling, whose scaling exponent ranges from -3 to -5/3 corresponding to
different Levy processes and reduces to the limiting Kolmogorov scaling -5/3
underlying a Gaussian process. The truncated Levy process and multi-scaling due
to the boundary effect is also discussed. Finally, we further extend our model
to reflecting the history-dependent fractional Brownian motion.

non-trivial (closed) invariant subspaces of (bounded linear) operators. Also a
topological tool is used which is new in the search of invariant subspaces: the
extraction of continuous selections of lower semicontinuous set valued
functions. The advantage of this method over previously known methods is that
if an operator acts on a reflexive Banach space then it has a non-trivial
invariant subspace if and only if there exist compatible sequences (their
definition refers to a fixed operator). Using compatible sequences a result of
Aronszajn-Smith is proved for reflexive Banach spaces. Also it is shown that if
$X$ be a reflexive Banach space, $T \in {\mathcal L} (X)$, and $A$ is any
closed ball of $X$, then either there exists $v \in A$ such that $Tv=0$, or
there exists $v \in A$ such that $\bar{\text{Span}} \text{Orb}_T (Tv)$ is a

minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimates of a continuous parameter \gamma
taking values in a differentiable manifold \Gamma is that they are not
invariant to arbitrary ``reparameterizations'' of \Gamma. This paper clarifies
the issues surrounding this problem, by pointing out the difference between
coordinate invariance, which is a sine qua non for a mathematically
well-defined problem, and diffeomorphism invariance, which is a substantial
issue, and then provides a solution. We first show that the presence of a
metric structure on \Gamma can be used to define coordinate-invariant MAP and
MMSE estimates, and we argue that this is the natural way to proceed. We then
discuss the choice of a metric structure on \Gamma. By imposing an invariance
criterion natural within a Bayesian framework, we show that this choice is
essentially unique. It does not necessarily correspond to a choice of
coordinates. In cases of complete prior ignorance, when Jeffreys' prior is
used, the invariant MAP estimate reduces to the maximum likelihood estimate.
The invariant MAP estimate coincides with the minimum message length (MML)
estimate, but no discretization or approximation is used in its derivation.

Probab. 11 (2006) paper no. 25, 585-654",,,"math.PR",,"  Recently, several authors have studied maps where a function, describing the
local diffusion matrix of a diffusion process with a linear drift towards an
attraction point, is mapped into the average of that function with respect to
the unique invariant measure of the diffusion process, as a function of the
attraction point. Such mappings arise in the analysis of infinite systems of
diffusions indexed by the hierarchical group, with a linear attractive
interaction between the components. In this context, the mappings are called
renormalization transformations. We consider such maps for catalytic
Wright-Fisher diffusions. These are diffusions on the unit square where the
first component (the catalyst) performs an autonomous Wright-Fisher diffusion,
while the second component (the reactant) performs a Wright-Fisher diffusion
with a rate depending on the first component through a catalyzing function. We
determine the limit of rescaled iterates of renormalization transformations
acting on the diffusion matrices of such catalytic Wright-Fisher diffusions.

transition of icosahedral viral capsids - single-protein-thick crystalline

critical value determined by the competition between stretching and bending
energies of a closed 2D elastic network. In the present work we generalize this
approach to capsids with non-icosahedral symmetries, e.g., spherocylindrical
and conical shells. One key new physical ingredient is the role played by
nonzero spontaneous curvature. Another is associated with the special way in
which the energy of the twelve topologically-required five-fold sites depends
on the background local curvature of the shell in which they are embedded.
Systematic evaluation of these contributions leads to a shape phase diagram in
which transitions are observed from icosahedral to spherocylindrical capsids as
a function of the ratio of stretching to bending energies and of the
spontaneous curvature of the 2D protein network. We find that the transition
from icosahedral to spherocylindrical symmetry is continuous or weakly
first-order near the onset of buckling, leading to extensive shape degeneracy.
These results are discussed in the context of experimentally observed
variations in the shapes of a variety of viral capsids.

plasma boundary in a skin layer. Electrons can transport the plasma current
away from the skin layer due to their thermal motion. As a result, the width of
the skin layer increases when electron temperature effects are taken into
account. This phenomenon is called anomalous skin effect. The anomalous
penetration of the rf electric field occurs not only for transversely
propagating to the plasma boundary wave (inductively coupled plasmas) but also
for the wave propagating along the plasma boundary (capacitively coupled
plasmas). Such anomalous penetration of the rf field modifies the structure of
the capacitive sheath. Recent advances in the nonlinear, nonlocal theory of the
capacitive sheath are reported. It is shown that separating the electric field
profile into exponential and non-exponential parts yields an efficient
qualitative and quantitative description of the anomalous skin effect in both

single qubit local flips to be applied during the growth phase: growth of the

generates graph states with vertices of high degree and so is easily able to

the time of critical wave function spreading - the Ehrenfest time - emerges as
the characteristic time scale within which the concept of deterministic
behavior is admissible in physics. A scenario of ""quasi-determinism"" may be
then defined within which the motion is experimentally indistinguishable from
the truly deterministic motion of Newtonian mechanics. Beyond this time scale,
predictions for individual systems can be given only statistically and, in this
case, it is shown that diffusive decoherence is indeed a necessary ingredient
to establish the quantum-classical correspondence. Moreover, the

communication and computation tasks that cannot be done with conventional
information technology (IT). Optical Quantum Information Processing (QIP) holds
particular appeal, since it offers the prospect of communicating and computing
with the same type of qubit. Linear optical techniques have been shown to be
scalable, but the corresponding quantum computing circuits need many auxiliary
resources. Here we present an alternative approach to optical QIP, based on the
use of weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities and homodyne measurements. We show how
this approach provides the fundamental building blocks for highly efficient
non-absorbing single photon number resolving detectors, two qubit parity
detectors, Bell state measurements and finally near deterministic control-not
(CNOT) gates. These are essential QIP devices

efficient generation of single photons on demand, in which the plasmon is
efficiently out-coupled to a dielectric waveguide.

to understand the nature of quantum mechanics, especially within the context of
quantum computing and quantum information. This principle has been generalized
to quantitative statements as to what extent imperfect cloning is possible. We
delineate an aspect of the border between the possible and the impossible
concerning quantum cloning, by putting forward an entanglement-assisted scheme
for simulating perfect cloning in the context of weak measurements. This
phenomenon we call weak cloning of an unknown quantum state.

pressure between two gold-coated parallel plates by means of a micromachined
oscillator. In contrast to all previous experiments on the Casimir effect,
where a small relative error (varying from 1% to 15%) was achieved only at the
shortest separation, our smallest experimental error ($\sim 0.5$%) is achieved
over a wide separation range from 170 nm to 300 nm at 95% confidence. We have
formulated a rigorous metrological procedure for the comparison of experiment
and theory without resorting to the previously used root-mean-square deviation,
which has been criticized in the literature. This enables us to discriminate
among different competing theories of the thermal Casimir force, and to resolve
a thermodynamic puzzle arising from the application of Lifshitz theory to real
metals. Our results lead to a more rigorous approach for obtaining constraints
on hypothetical long-range interactions predicted by extra-dimensional physics
and other extensions of the Standard Model. In particular, the constraints on
non-Newtonian gravity are strengthened by up to a factor of 20 in a wide
interaction range at 95% confidence.
