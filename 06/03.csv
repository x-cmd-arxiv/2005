microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments in order to learn about
inflationary physics. We consider space-based, balloon-borne and ground-based
experiments. We find that foreground contamination and residuals from
foreground subtraction are ultimately the limiting factors in detecting a
primordial gravity wave signal. For full-sky space-based experiments, these
factors hinder the detection of tensor-to-scalar ratios of r < 10^{-3} on large
scales, while for ground-based experiments these factors impede the ability to
apply delensing techniques. We consider ground-based/balloon-borne experiments
of currently planned or proposed designs and find that it is possible for a
value of r=0.01 to be measured at ~ 3-sigma level. A small space-based CMB
polarization experiment, with current detector technology and full sky
coverage, can detect r ~ 10^{-3} at the ~ 3-sigma level, but a markedly
improved knowledge of polarized foregrounds is needed. We advocate using as
wide a frequency coverage as possible in order to carry out foreground
subtraction at the percent level, which is necessary to measure such a small
primordial tensor amplitude. To produce a clearly detectable (>3-sigma) tensor
component in a realistic CMB experiment, inflation must either involve
large-field variations, \Delta\phi >~ 1 or multi-field/hybrid models. Hybrid
models can be easily distinguished from large-field models due to their blue
scalar spectral index. Therefore, an observation of a tensor/scalar ratio and n
< 1 in future experiments with the characteristics considered here may be an
indication that inflation is being driven by some physics in which the inflaton
cannot be described as a fundamental field.

relativistic hydrodynamics (Banyuls et al. 1997) where magnetic fields were not
considered. The GRMHD equations are written in conservative form to exploit
their hyperbolic character in the solution procedure. All theoretical
ingredients necessary to build up high-resolution shock-capturing schemes based
on the solution of local Riemann problems (i.e. Godunov-type schemes) are
described. In particular, we use a renormalized set of regular eigenvectors of
the flux Jacobians of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations. In
addition, the paper describes a procedure based on the equivalence principle of
general relativity that allows the use of Riemann solvers designed for special
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in GRMHD. Our formulation and numerical
methodology are assessed by performing various test simulations recently
considered by different authors. These include magnetized shock tubes,
spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, equatorial accretion onto
a Kerr black hole, and magnetized thick accretion disks around a black hole
prone to the magnetorotational instability.

of Sculptor, and to determine the level of interaction between this system and
the Galaxy. Photometry was obtained in two colours down to the magnitude limits
of V=20 and I=19, covering a 3.1 times 3.1 square deg area centred on Sculptor.
The resulting colour-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate
horizontal branch and red giant branch stars for this system. Previous work has
shown that the red horizontal branch (HB) stars are more concentrated than the
blue HB stars. We have determined the radial distributions of these two
populations and show that the overall Sculptor density profile is well
described by a two component model based on a combination of these radial
distributions. Additionally, spectra of the Ca ii triplet region were obtained
for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 square deg region using the
2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These spectra were used to
remove foreground Galactic stars based on radial velocity and Ca ii triplet
strength. The final list of Sculptor members contained 148 stars, seven of
which are located beyond the nominal tidal radius. Both the photometric and
spectroscopic datasets indicate no significant extra-tidal structure. These
results support at most a mild level of interaction between this system and the
Galaxy, and we have measured an upper mass limit for extra-tidal material to be
2.3 +/- 0.6% of the Sculptor luminous mass. This lack of tidal interaction
indicates that previous velocity dispersion measurements (and hence the amount
of dark matter detected) in this system are not strongly influenced by the
Galactic tidal field.

galaxy rotation curves, transition from early cosmic deceleration to recent
acceleration; and naturally overcome other dark scenarios' difficulties: the
substructure and cuspy core problems, the difference of dark halo distributions
in galaxies and clusters, and the cosmic coincidence. Very interestingly, Dirac
particles have $f_\sigma=1/\sqrt 2$, all bosonic matter particles have
$f_\sigma=0$, and the only exceptional boson is the graviton itself, which may
have $f_\sigma>1$.

sensitivity over the central 8""x 8"" area is discussed. It shows a central core
(unresolved along the E-W direction) and an extended emission which draws a
spiral pattern similar to that observed on near-infrared images. Patches of MIR
emission can be detected up to a distance of 4"" from the core. The deconvolved
12.8mic map is fully consistent with previous high-resolution MIR observations.
It highlights the structure of the extended emission, already seen on the
un-deconvolved image, and allows to identify a set of mid-infrared sources: 7
in the NE quadrant and 5 in the SW quadrant. The MIR emission map is compared
with those obtained at comparable angular resolution in the near-infrared and
in the [OIII] line emission. The very good correlation between the VISIR map
and the HST optical map supports the idea that the MIR emission not associated
with the torus arises from dust associated with the narrow line region clouds.
The N-S extension of the MIR core (0.44"") is then probably simply due to the
mixing of the MIR emission from the dusty torus and the MIR emission from NLR
cloud B, located only 0.1"" to the North.

yielded a mass ratio q = 0.68; this is very different from the value of 1.13
quoted in the literature. Using the new lower mass ratio, and constraining the
mass of the white dwarf to be within reasonable limits, then leads to a mass
for the secondary star that is substantially less than would be expected for
its orbital period if it satisfied a main-sequence mass-radius relationship. We
find a spectral type of M0 that is consistent with that expected for a
main-sequence star of the low mass we have found. However, in order to fill its

photons as radio-loud ones this class of objects also represents a challenge
for modeling high energy processes close to a black hole. Both a hot optically
thin plasma and a cooler optically thick accretion disk are usually thought to
be present in the vicinity of a black hole although the details of the
accretion flow are still under discussion. The role of the disk seems to
decrease with a drop in the Eddington ratio: in sources like quasars and Narrow
Line Seyfert 1 galaxies disk flow dominates while in Seyfert galaxies the disk
retreats, and in sources like LINERS or Sgr A* a disk is most likely absent.
Shocks and reconnections are possibly taking place in an inner hot flow and in
the magnetic corona above the cold disk. Uncollimated outflow is also present
and it may carry significant fraction of available mass and energy.

resolving the motion of scattering sites in cases that this motion changes
systematically with time. The method is based on the visibility of the speckle
pattern formed by the scattered light as detected by a single exposure of a
digital camera. Whereas previous multispeckle methods rely on correlations
between images, here the connection with scattering site dynamics is made more
simply in terms of the variance of intensity among the pixels of the camera for
the specified exposure duration. The essence is that the speckle pattern is
more visible, i.e. the variance of detected intensity levels is greater, when
the dynamics of the scattering site motion is slow compared to the exposure
time of the camera. The theory for analyzing the moments of the spatial
intensity distribution in terms of the electric field autocorrelation is
presented. It is demonstrated for two well-understood samples, a colloidal
suspension of Brownian particles and a coarsening foam, where the dynamics can
be treated as stationary. However, the method is particularly appropriate for
samples in which the dynamics vary with time, either slowly or rapidly, limited
only by the exposure time fidelity of the camera. Potential applications range
from soft-glassy materials, to granular avalanches, to flowmetry of living
tissue.

is expression level, for reasons which have remained unexplained. Here, we
hypothesize that selection to reduce the burden of protein misfolding will
favor protein sequences with increased robustness to translational missense
errors. Pressure for translational robustness increases with expression level
and constrains sequence evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes,
global expression and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to
an ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding
effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the variation in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates. We examine causes for
expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide tests favor the
translational robustness explanation over existing hypotheses that invoke
constraints on function or translational efficiency. Our results suggest that
proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated to their functions, and can explain
why highly expressed proteins evolve slowly across the tree of life.

information into a subspace of a Hilbert space, but to encode information into
a subsystem of a Hilbert space. Recently this notion has led to a more general
notion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction.
In standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a
procedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any
correctable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the
correction procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead
one must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not
lead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery
routines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present
two examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are
motivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices.
In three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field
theory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting.
Such a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to
noise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.

  Since the non-commutative version of the classical system based on the
compact group SU(2) has been constructed in (quant-ph/0502174) by making use of
Jaynes-Commings model and so-called Quantum Diagonalization Method in
(quant-ph/0502147), we construct a non-commutative version of the classical
system based on the non-compact group SU(1,1) by modifying the compact case.
  In this model the Hamiltonian is not hermite but pseudo hermite, which causes
a big difference between two models. For example, in the classical
representation theory of SU(1,1), unitary representations are infinite
dimensional from the starting point. Therefore, to develop a unitary theory of
non-commutative system of SU(1,1) we need an infinite number of non-commutative
systems, which means a kind of {\bf second non-commutativization}. This is a
very hard and interesting problem.
  We develop a corresponding theory though it is not always enough, and present
some challenging problems concerning how classical properties can be extended
to the non-commutative case.
  This paper is arranged for the convenience of readers as the first subsection
is based on the standard model (SU(2) system) and the next one is based on the
non-standard model (SU(1,1) system). This contrast may make the similarity and
difference between the standard and non-standard models clear.
