as a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final version of the
two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). The reduced three point
correlation function, Q_3 is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes,
employing a full covariance analysis. The form of Q_3 is consistent with the
expectations for the \Lambda-cold dark matter model, confirming that the
primary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational
instability acting on Gaussian primordial fluctuations. However, we find a
clear offset in amplitude between Q_3 for galaxies and the predictions for the
dark matter. We are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are
unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-sigma level. On weakly non-linear scales,
we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters. We find a
linear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} and
a quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. This is the first
significant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small but
important non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. Our
estimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the
normalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with
the measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the
amplitude of matter fluctuations. We find that the rms linear theory variance
in spheres of radius 8Mpc/h is \sigma_8 = 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, providing an
independent confirmation of values derived from other techniques. On non-linear
scales, where \xi>1, we find that Q_3 has a strong dependence on scale, colour
and luminosity.

mode A occurs simultaneously at these frequencies, while modes B and C only

frequency there is still emission at the higher frequency, hinting towards the
presence of mode B emission at a weaker level. Further, we have established
that modes A and B are associated with two orthogonal modes of polarisation,

modes A and B at a given frequency are emitted in two concentric rings around
the magnetic axis with mode B being nested inside mode A. Further, it is
evident that this nested configuration is preserved across frequency with the
higher frequency arising closer to the stellar surface compared to the lower

survey. The comparison is carried out in a multi-stage process and makes
optimal use of both radio surveys by exploiting the sensitivity of the NVSS to
extended and multi-component radio sources in addition to the high angular
resolution of the FIRST images. A radio source sample with 95% completeness and
98.9% reliability is achieved, far better than would be possible for this
sample if only one of the surveys was used. The radio source sample is then
divided into two classes: radio-loud AGN and galaxies in which the radio
emission is dominated by star formation. The division is based on the location
of a galaxy in the plane of 4000Ang break strength versus radio luminosity per
unit stellar mass and provides a sample of 2215 radio-loud AGN and 497 star
forming galaxies brighter than 5mJy at 1.4GHz. A full catalogue of positions

luminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 W/Hz. The fraction of galaxies that host
radio-loud AGN with L(1.4GHz) > 10^23 W/Hz is a strong function of stellar
mass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 Msun to more than
30% at 5x10^11 Msun. The integral radio luminosity function is derived in six
ranges of stellar and black hole mass. Its shape is very similar in all of
these ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. Its normalisation
varies strongly with mass, as M_*^2.5 or M_BH^1.6; this scaling only begins to
break down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. There is no
correlation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud AGN
in the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud is
independent of whether it is optically classified as an AGN. The host galaxies
of the radio-loud AGN have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies of
the same mass.
  All of these findings support the conclusion that the optical AGN and low
radio luminosity AGN phenomena are independent and are triggered by different
physical mechanisms. Intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of the
radio-loud AGN fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from the
hot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. It is speculated that gas cooling
provides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud AGN activity,
and it is argued that AGN heating could plausibly balance the cooling of the
gas over time. [Abridged]

disk. We observe two components of gas at widely different temperatures along

kinetic temperature of 51K. Such low temperatures are typical of the diffuse
interstellar medium. Since the line of sight to HD141569A does not pass through
its disk, it appears that we are observing the cold H2 in a low extinction
envelope associated with the high Galactic latitude dark cloud complex L134N,
which is in the same direction and at nearly the same distance as HD141569A.
The column densities of the higher J-levels of H2 suggest the presence of warm

observed radial velocity of the gas implies that the UV spectral lines we

that the transition process between these phases follows a decay mechanism very

that they are strongly dependent on the direction of the transformation, i.e.,
from low to high coverage or vice versa. Inspired by this asymmetry, we
introduce a square-wave periodic external forcing, whose two parameters can be
tuned to enhance the catalytic activity. At CO desorption rates below the
critical value, we find that this far-from-equilibrium system undergoes a
dynamic phase transition between a CO_2 productive phase and a nonproductive

in pentane (C5H12) and heptane (C7H16), physisorbed onto the basal plane of
graphite at near-monolayer coverages. Through use of the newest, optimized
version of the anisotropic united-atom model (AUA4) to simulate both systems at
two separate coverages, this study provides evidence that the melting
transition for pentane and heptane monolayers are significantly different.
Specifically, this study proposes a very rapid transition from the solid
crystalline rectangular-centered (RC) phase to a fluid phase in pentane
monolayers, whereas heptane monolayers exhibit a slower transition that
involves a more gradual loss of RC order in the solid-fluid phase transition.
Through a study of the melting behavior, encompassing variations where the
formation of gauche defects in the alkyl chains are eliminated, this study
proposes that this gradual melting behavior for heptane monolayers is a result
of less orientational mobility of the heptane molecules in the solid RC phase,
as compared to the pentane molecules. This idea is supported through a study of
a nonane monolayer, which gives the gradual melting signature that heptane
monolayers also seem to indicate. The results of this work are compared to
previous experiment over pentane and heptane monolayers, and are found to be in
good agreement.

divergence-free probability current. In the linear case the force can be split
into two parts, one of which gives detailed balance with the diffusive motion,

Using the Jordan transformation for the force matrix, we find an explicit

  d'Analyse statistique des Donn\'{e}es Textuelles (2004) 1219",,,"cs.IR",,"  This paper presents an original methodology to consider question answering.
We noticed that query expansion is often incorrect because of a bad
understanding of the question. But the automatic good understanding of an
utterance is linked to the context length, and the question are often short.
This methodology proposes to analyse the documents and to construct an
informative structure from the results of the analysis and from a semantic text
expansion. The linguistic analysis identifies words (tokenization and
morphological analysis), links between words (syntactic analysis) and word
sense (semantic disambiguation). The text expansion adds to each word the
synonyms matching its sense and replaces the words in the utterances by
derivatives, modifying the syntactic schema if necessary. In this way, whatever
enrichment may be, the text keeps the same meaning, but each piece of
information matches many realisations. The questioning method consists in
constructing a local informative structure without enrichment, and matches it
with the documentary structure. If a sentence in the informative structure
matches the question structure, this sentence is the answer to the question.

serious drawbacks, since words are usually synonyms only in restricted

factorization scheme and scale M_\gamma at the virtual photon vertex for the
occurrence of factorization breaking. The strong M_\gamma-dependence, which is
present when only the resolved cross section is suppressed, is tamed by
introducing the suppression also into the initial-state NLO correction of the

Special relativity eliminates the absolute rest frame but continues to require
the absolute inertial frame. General relativity solves this for gravity by
requiring particles to have locally inertial frames on a curved position-time
manifold. The problem of the absolute inertial frame for other forces remains.
We look again at the transformations of frames on an extended phase space with
position, time, energy and momentum degrees of freedom. Under nonrelativistic
assumptions, there is an invariant symplectic metric and a line element dt^2.
Under special relativistic assumptions the symplectic metric continues to be
invariant but the line elements are now -dt^2+dq^2/c^2 and dp^2-de^2/c^2. Max
Born conjectured that the line element should be generalized to the pseudo-
orthogonal metric -dt^2+dq^2/c^2+ (1/b^2)(dp^2-de^2/c^2). The group leaving
these two metrics invariant is the pseudo-unitary group of transformations
between noninertial frames. We show that these transformations eliminate the
need for an absolute inertial frame by making forces relative and bounded by b
and so embodies a relativity that is 'reciprocal' in the sense of Born. The
inhomogeneous version of this group is naturally the semidirect product of the
pseudo-unitary group with the nonabelian Heisenberg group. This is the
quaplectic group. The Heisenberg group itself is the semidirect product of two
translation groups. This provides the noncommutative properties of position and
momentum and also time and energy that are required for the quantum mechanics
that results from considering the unitary representations of the quaplectic
group.
