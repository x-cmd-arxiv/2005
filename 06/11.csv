$\sigma^2$ Coronae Borealis. The RGS and EPIC MOS2 spectra were simultaneously
fitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determine
coronal abundances of various elements. Contrary to the solar first ionization
potential (FIP) effect in which elements with a low FIP are overabundant in the
corona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' FIP
effect observed in several active RS CVn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in
$\sigma^2$ CrB show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in the
Chandra HETGS analysis of $\sigma^2$ CrB with a different methodology (Osten et
al. 2003). Low-FIP elements ($<10$ eV) have their abundance ratios relative to
Fe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-FIP elements
have their abundance ratios increase with increasing FIP. We find that the
coronal Fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,
indicating that there is no metal depletion in $\sigma^2$ CrB. However, we
obtain a higher Fe absolute abundance than in Osten et al. (2003). Except for
Ar and S, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than those
reported by Osten et al. (2003). However, a comparison of their model with our
XMM-Newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately in
general. We find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the other
to derive coronal abundances. Despite the systematic discrepancy in absolute
abundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by Osten et
al. (2003). Finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \ion{O}{7}
($< 4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densities
measured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.

speculation concerning its age and the energetics of the supernova explosion
that produced it. We have carried out the first in-depth analysis of the
remnant's evolution and its various interactions: with the stellar winds
flowing out from the inner ~2 pc, with the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, and
with the 50 km/s molecular cloud behind and to the East of the nucleus. We have
found that a rather ""standard"" supernova explosion with energy ~1.5e51 ergs is
sufficient to create the remnant we see today, and that the latter is probably
only ~1,700 years old. The X-ray Ridge between ~9"" and 15"" to the NE of Sgr A*
appears to be the product of the current interaction between the remaining
supernova ejecta and the outflowing winds. Perhaps surprisingly, we have also
found that the passage of the remnant across the black hole would have enhanced
the accretion rate onto the central object by less than a factor 2. Such a
small increase cannot explain the current Fe fluorescence observed from the
molecular cloud Sgr B2; this fluorescence would have required an increase in
Sgr A*'s luminosity by 6 orders of magnitude several hundred years ago.
Instead, we have uncovered what appears to be a more plausible scenario for
this transient irradiation--the interaction between the expanding remnant and
the 50 km/s molecular cloud. The first impact would have occurred about 1,200
years after the explosion, producing a 2-200 keV luminosity of ~1e39 ergs/s.
During the intervening 300-400 years, the dissipation of kinetic energy
subsided considerably, leading to the much lower luminosity (~1e36 ergs/s at
2-10 keV) we see today.

among the highest rotation measures reported so far in the nucleus of any

curves of V1974 Cygni (Nova Cygni 1992). Based on an optically thick wind model
of nova outbursts, we have calculated light curves and searched for the best
fit model that is consistent with optical, UV, and X-ray observations. Our best
fit model is a white dwarf (WD) of mass 1.05 M_\sun with a chemical composition
of X=0.46, C+N+O=0.15, and Ne = 0.05 by mass weight. Both supersoft X-ray and
continuum UV 1455 \AA light curves are well reproduced. Supersoft X-rays
emerged on day ~ 250 after outburst, which is naturally explained by our model:
our optically thick winds cease on day 245 and supersoft X-rays emerge from
self-absorption by the winds. The X-ray flux keeps a constant peak value for ~
300 days followed by a quick decay on day ~ 600. The duration of X-ray flat
peak is well reproduced by a steady hydrogen shell burning on the WD. Optical
light curve is also explained by the same model if we introduce free-free
emission from optically thin ejecta. A t^{-1.5} slope of the observed optical
and infrared fluxes is very close to the slope of our modeled free-free light
curve during the optically thick wind phase. Once the wind stops, optical and
infrared fluxes should follow a t^{-3} slope, derived from a constant mass of
expanding ejecta. An abrupt transition from a t^{-1.5} slope to a t^{-3} slope
at day ~ 200 is naturally explained by the change from the wind phase to the
post-wind phase on day ~ 200. The development of hard X-ray flux is also
reasonably understood as shock-origin between the wind and the companion star.
The distance to V1974 Cyg is estimated to be ~ 1.7 kpc with E(B-V)= 0.32 from
the light curve fitting for the continuum UV 1455 \AA.

first detected in 2003 February by the All-Sky Monitor, and reached a peak
2.5-25 keV flux of 8x10^-9 ergs/cm^2/s (around 240 mCrab). The only other known
outburst occurred 32.2 yr earlier, likely the longest presently known
recurrence time for any X-ray transient. Proportional Counter Array (PCA)
observations over the 5-month duration of the 2003 outburst revealed a 2.763 s
pulsar in a 22.58 d orbit. The detection of pulsations down to a flux of
3x10^-11 ergs/cm^2/s (2.5-25 keV), along with the inferred long-term accretion
rate of 8.1x10^-11 M_sun/yr (assuming a distance of 10 kpc) suggests that the
surface magnetic field strength is below ~5x10^11 G. The corresponding
cyclotron energy is thus below 4 keV, consistent with the non-detection of
resonance features at high energies. Although we could not unambiguously
identify the optical counterpart, the lack of a bright IR candidate within the
1' RXTE error circle rules out a supergiant mass donor. The neutron star in 4U
1901+03 probably accretes from the wind of a main-sequence O-B star, like most
other high-mass binary X-ray pulsars. The almost circular orbit e=0.036
confirms the system's membership in a growing class of wide, low-eccentricity

distribution has an inner hole with radius $r_{i,gas}$, the surface density at
that inner radius is limited to values ranging from $\lesssim 3$ gm cm$^{-2}$
at $r_{i,gas}=0.5$ AU to 0.1 gm cm$^{-2}$ at $r_{i,gas}= 5-20$ AU. These values
are considerably below the value for a minimum mass solar nebula, and suggest

understanding the process of planet formation. In disks surrounding solar type
protostars, the bulk of the disk mass resides in the outer midplane, which is
cold ($\leq$20 K), dense ($\geq 10^7$ cm$^{-3}$) and depleted of CO. Observing
the disk midplane has proved, therefore, to be a formidable challenge.
Ceccarelli et al. (2004) detected H$_2$D$^+$ emission in a proto-planetary disk
and claimed that it probes the midplane gas. Indeed, since all heavy-elements
bearing molecules condense out onto the grain mantles, the most abundant ions
in the disk midplane are predicted to be H$_3^+$ and its isotopomers. In this
article, we carry out a theoretical study of the chemical structure of the
outer midplane of proto-planetary disks. Using a self-consistent physical model
for the flaring disk structure, we compute the abundances of H$_3^+$ and its
deuterated forms across the disk midplane. We also provide the average column
densities across the disk of H$_3^+$, H$_2$D$^+$, HD$_2^+$ and D$_3^+$, and
line intensities of the ground transitions of the ortho and para forms of

cosmic ray ionization rate, dust-to-gas ratio and average grain radius, and
general stellar/disk parameters. An important factor is the poorly understood
freeze-out of N$_2$ molecules onto grains, which we investigate in depth. We
finally summarize the diagnostic values of observations of the H$_3^+$
isotopomers.

not want to let outside firms(usually called MSSPs-Managed Security Service
Providers) to take care of their security need is that they worry about service
quality MSSPs provide because they cannot monitor effort of the MSSPs. Since
MSSPs action is unobservable to buyers, MSSPs can lower cost by working less
hard than required in the contract and get higher profit. In the asymmetric
information literature, this possible secret shirking behavior is termed as
moral hazard problem. This paper considers a game theoretic economic framework
to show that under information asymmetry, an optimal contract can be designed
so that MSSPs will stick to their promised effort level. We also show that the
optimal contract should be performance-based, i.e., payment to MSSP should base
on performance of MSSP's security service period by period. For comparison, we
also showed that if the moral hazard problem does not exist, the optimal
contract does not depend on MSSP's performance. A contract that specifies
constant payment to MSSP will be optimal. Besides these, we show that for no
matter under perfect information scenario or imperfect information scenario,
the higher the transaction cost is, the lower payment to MSSPs will be.

detect many thousands of low frequency gravitational wave signals. This
presents a data analysis challenge that is very different to the one
encountered in ground based gravitational wave astronomy. LISA data analysis
requires the identification of individual signals from a data stream containing
an unknown number of overlapping signals. Because of the signal overlaps, a
global fit to all the signals has to be performed in order to avoid biasing the
solution. However, performing such a global fit requires the exploration of an
enormous parameter space with a dimension upwards of 50,000. Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods offer a very promising solution to the LISA data analysis
problem. MCMC algorithms are able to efficiently explore large parameter
spaces, simultaneously providing parameter estimates, error analyses and even
model selection. Here we present the first application of MCMC methods to
simulated LISA data and demonstrate the great potential of the MCMC approach.
Our implementation uses a generalized F-statistic to evaluate the likelihoods,
and simulated annealing to speed convergence of the Markov chains. As a final
step we super-cool the chains to extract maximum likelihood estimates, and
estimates of the Bayes factors for competing models. We find that the MCMC
approach is able to correctly identify the number of signals present, extract
the source parameters, and return error estimates consistent with Fisher
information matrix predictions.

asymptotically flat 4D spacetime is constructed using the algebraic approach
based on Weyl algebra associated to a BMS-invariant symplectic form. The
constructed theory is invariant under a suitable unitary representation of the
BMS group with manifest meaning when the fields are interpreted as suitable
extensions to $\Im^+$ of massless minimally coupled fields propagating in the
bulk. The analysis of the found unitary BMS representation proves that such a
field on $\Im^+$ coincides with the natural wave function constructed out of
the unitary BMS irreducible representation induced from the little group
$\Delta$, the semidirect product between SO(2) and the two dimensional
translational group. The result proposes a natural criterion to solve the long
standing problem of the topology of BMS group. Indeed the found natural
correspondence of quantum field theories holds only if the BMS group is
equipped with the nuclear topology rejecting instead the Hilbert one.
Eventually some theorems towards a holographic description on $\Im^+$ of QFT in
the bulk are established at level of $C^*$ algebras of fields for strongly
asymptotically predictable spacetimes. It is proved that preservation of a
certain symplectic form implies the existence of an injective $*$-homomorphism
from the Weyl algebra of fields of the bulk into that associated with the
boundary $\Im^+$. Those results are, in particular, applied to 4D Minkowski
spacetime where a nice interplay between Poincar\'e invariance in the bulk and
BMS invariance on the boundary at $\Im^+$ is established at level of QFT. It
arises that the $*$-homomorphism admits unitary implementation and Minkowski
vacuum is mapped into the BMS invariant vacuum on $\Im^+$.

hole quasi-normal modes is found. Secondly, we provide a simple, relativistic
modification of the Newtonian quadrupole formula which, in certain regimes,
yields excellent agreement with the perturbative approach. This holds true as
long as back-scattering of GWs is negligible. Otherwise, any functional form of

framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM), the
CP-odd invariant related to the soft trilinear A-phase at the GUT scale,
theta_A, induces non-trivial and distinct CP-odd phases for the three gaugino
masses at the weak scale. The latter give one-loop contributions to EDMs
enhanced by tan beta, and can provide the dominant contribution to the electron
EDM induced by theta_A. We perform a detailed analysis of the EDM constraints
within the CMSSM, exhibiting the reach, in terms of sparticle spectra, which
may be obtained assuming generic phases, as well as the limits on the CP-odd
phases for some specific parameter points where detailed phenomenological
studies are available. We also illustrate how this reach will expand with
results from the next generation of experiments which are currently in

single lepton flavours. We show that the effects from single lepton flavours
become very important in variants of resonant leptogenesis, where the observed
baryon asymmetry in the Universe is created by lepton-to-baryon conversion of
an individual lepton number, for example that of the tau lepton. The
predictions of such resonant tau-leptogenesis models for the final baryon
asymmetry are almost independent of the initial lepton-number and heavy
neutrino abundances. These models accommodate the current neutrino data and
have a number of testable phenomenological implications. They contain
electroweak-scale heavy Majorana neutrinos with appreciable couplings to
electrons and muons, which can be probed at future e+ e- and mu+ mu-
high-energy colliders. In particular, resonant tau-leptogenesis models predict
sizeable 0\nu\beta\beta decay, as well as e- and mu-number-violating processes,
such as mu -> e gamma and mu -> e conversion in nuclei, with rates that are

first quantized theories and compared to second quantized treatments. Within
first quantized theories, general oscillation probabilities can be found for
Dirac fermions and charged spin 0 bosons. A clear modification in the
oscillation formulas can be obtained and its origin is elucidated and confirmed
to be inevitable from completeness and causality requirements. The left-handed
nature of created and detected neutrinos can also be implemented in the first
quantized Dirac theory in presence of mixing; the probability loss due to the
changing of initially left-handed neutrinos to the undetected right-handed
neutrinos can be obtained in analytic form. Concerning second quantized
approaches, it is shown in a calculation using virtual neutrino propagation
that both neutrinos and antineutrinos may also contribute as intermediate
particles. The sign of the contributing neutrino energy may have to be chosen
explicitly without being automatic in the formalism. At last, a simple second
quantized description of the flavor oscillation phenomenon is devised. In this
description there is no interference terms between positive and negative
components, but it still gives simple normalized oscillation probabilities. A
new effect appearing in this context is an inevitable but tiny violation of the
initial flavor of neutrinos. The probability loss due to the conversion of
left-handed neutrinos to right-handed neutrinos is also presented.

if $\rho$ is a discrete embedding onto a normal subgroup of a convex cocompact

$\Teich/Q$ where $Q$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group defined by
$\Gamma/\rho(\pi_1(S))$. When the image of $\rho$ contains parabolic elements,
then $E_\rho$ is not proper. Using the recent solution of Marden's Tameness
Conjecture, we show that if $\rho$ is a discrete embedding into $\SLtC$, then
$E_\rho$ is proper if and only if $\rho$ is quasi-Fuchsian. These results are
used to prove that the mapping class group acts properly on the subset of

algebra sl_n(K) that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form,
where K=R or K=C. In particular, a complete collection of MUBs in C^n gives
rise to a so-called orthogonal decomposition (OD) of sl_n(C). The converse
holds if the Cartan subalgebras in the OD are also *-closed, i.e., closed under
the adjoint operation. In this case, the Cartan subalgebras have unitary bases,
and the above correspondence becomes equivalent to a result relating
collections of MUBs to collections of maximal commuting classes of unitary
error bases, i.e., orthogonal unitary matrices.
  It is a longstanding conjecture that ODs of sl_n(C) can only exist if n is a
prime power. This corroborates further the general belief that a complete
