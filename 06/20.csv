theory, operates with nonosculating Andoyer elements. This situation parallels
a similar phenomenon that often happens (but seldom gets noticed) in orbital
dynamics, when the standard Lagrange-type or Delaunay-type planetary equations
unexpectedly render nonosculating orbital elements. In orbital mechanics,
osculation loss happens when a velocity-dependent perturbation is plugged into
the standard planetary equations. In attitude mechanics, osculation is lost
when an angular-velocity-dependent disturbance is plugged in the standard
dynamical equations for the Andoyer elements. We encounter exactly this
situation in the theory of Earth rotation, because this theory contains an
angular-velocity-dependent perturbation (the switch from an inertial frame to
that associated with the precessing ecliptic of date).
  While the osculation loss does not influence the predictions for the figure
axis of the planet, it considerably alters the predictions for the
instantaneous spin-axis' orientation. We explore this issue in great detail.

galaxies, an effect which is used to place constraints on cosmological
parameters, and to explore the evolution of dark matter and dark energy in the
universe. However, a possible systematic contaminant of the lensing signal is
intrinsic galaxy alignment, with a correlation length of a few Mpc. Hirata &
Seljak (2004) have recently demonstrated that for some models of intrinsic
distortions, there may also be a cross-correlation between the intrinsic and
lensing signals, which may dominate the intrinsic signal, and suppress the
lensing power spectrum by several tens of percent. Unlike the pure intrinsic
signal, this new term cannot be accounted for by neglecting or down-weighting
pairs of galaxies which are physically close. Extending the correlation
function tomography method of King & Schneider (2003) we illustrate how the
impact of both intrinsic and cross-correlations can be significantly reduced,
in the context of surveys with photometric redshift information. For a
ground-based cosmic shear survey of ~100 sq. degrees with photometric
redshifts, even in the presence of systematic contaminants at the level
considered here, cosmological models degenerate in the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane
can be distinguished well in excess of the 3-sigma level.

soft/hard transition during the luminosity decrease. Surprisingly the
luminosities at the second transition is always lower by a factor of 3 to 5. A
model for this hysteresis was presented in a preceding paper: It was shown that
this switch in the accretion mode at different mass accretion rates and
therefore different luminosities is caused by the different amount of Compton
cooling or heating of the accretion disk corona as it is irradiated by hard or
soft radiation from the central light source, respectively. We now give
detailed results on the dependence on hardness of this radiation and on
radiation efficiency. We further discuss the influence of the inclination and a

  From the spectral shape of the excess the WIMP mass is estimated to be

sense that only the known shapes of signal and background were fitted with free

with a fit of the conventional galactic model to the EGRET data. These signals

with regular eigenfunctions. Examples are provided by inertial waves in a
rotating fluid contained in a spherical annulus, and internal gravity waves in
a stratified fluid contained in a tank with a non-rectangular cross-section.
For wave frequencies in the ranges of interest, the inviscid linearized
equations are spatially hyperbolic and their characteristic rays are typically
focused on to wave attractors. When these systems experience periodic forcing,
for example of tidal origin, the response of the fluid can become localized in
the neighbourhood of a wave attractor. In this paper I define a prototypical
problem of this form and construct analytically the long-term response to a
periodic body force in the asymptotic limit of small viscosity. The vorticity
of the fluid is localized in a detached shear layer close to the wave attractor
in such a way that the total rate of dissipation of energy is asymptotically
independent of the viscosity. I further demonstrate that the same asymptotic
dissipation rate is obtained if a non-viscous damping force is substituted for
the Navier-Stokes viscosity. I discuss the application of these results to the
problem of tidal forcing in giant planets and stars, where the excitation and
dissipation of inertial waves may make a dominant, or at least important,
contribution to the orbital and spin evolution.

arms inside the CNR. GEMINI and HST imagery allow the construction of high

the CNR. The CNR is composed of extremely young HII regions still enshrouded in
their dust cocoons. However, the nuclear (J-K_s) color can not be explained in
this manner. Therefore, we propose the contribution of C-Stars as the most
feasible mechanism for explaining the colors. If the nuclear stellar population
is comparable to that of the LMC bar, 500 C-stars and 25000 AGB O-rich stars
inside 50 pc may reproduce the observed colors. C-Stars release enriched
material to the nuclear environment, probably fueling the central engine of
this Sy 2 galaxy during the lifetime of stars with masses between 2 M_sun <
M_C-star < 6 M_sun (C-star phase). The ejected material that remains trapped in
the central potential might also explain the systematically observed increased

followed by a flattening and by a further steepening. During these transitions
the soft X-ray spectrum of these GRBs remains constant within the observational

the temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglow
emitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after the
trigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at a
close link between the two. Averaging over the bursts that have a rather well

strengths to those observed in GBHs, but at lower frequencies commensurate with
their larger black hole masses - they would be exceedingly difficult to detect.
Our results offer a simple explanation for the present lack of QPO detections

patterns needed to make QPO detections feasible. The most efficient type of
future observatory for searching for X-ray QPOs in AGN is an X-ray All-Sky

detecting low frequency QPOs in nearby AGN. The detection of AGN QPOs would
strengthen the AGN-GBH connection and could serve as powerful diagnostics of

potentials of hard-spheroid solutes with aspect ratios $x$ in the range $1/5

molecule, are presented. It is shown that for a given molecular volume and
solvent dipole moment (or temperature) a spherical solute has the lowest excess
chemical potential and hence the highest solubility, while a prolate solute
with aspect ratio $x$ should be more soluble than an oblate solute with aspect
ratio $1/x$. For a given solute molecule, the excess chemical potential
increases with increasing temperature; this same trend is observed in the case
of hydrophobic solvation. To help interpret the simulation results, comparison
is made with a scaled-particle theory that requires prior knowledge of a
solute-solvent interfacial tension and the pure-solvent equation of state,
which parameters are obtained from simulation results for spherical solutes.
The theory shows excellent agreement with simulation results over the whole

quadrupoles, octupoles, hexadecapoles, etc. Usually, the ordering of any
multipole component leaves the system sufficiently symmetrical to allow a
second symmetry breaking transition. Assuming that a second continuous phase
transition occurs, we classify the possibilities. We construct the symmetry
group of the first ordered phase, and then re-classify the order parameters in
the new symmetry. While this is straightforward for dipole or quadrupole order,
it is less familiar for octupole order. We give a group theoretical analysis,
and some illustrative mean field calculations, for the hypothetical case when a
second ordering transition modifies the primary T(xyz) octupolar ordering in a
tetragonal system like URu2Si2. If quadrupoles appear in the second phase
transition, they must be accompanied by a time-reversal-odd multipole as an
induced order parameter. For O(xy), O(zx), or O(yz) quadrupoles, this would be
one of the components of J, which should be easy either to check or to rule
out. However, a pre-existing octupolar symmetry can also be broken by a
transition to a new octupole--hexadecapole order, or by a combination of O(22)
quadrupole and triakontadipole order. It is interesting to notice that if
recent NQR results (Saitoh et al, 2005) on URu2Si2 are interpreted as a hint
that the onset of octupolar hidden order at T0=17K is followed by quadrupolar
ordering at T* = 13.5K, this sequence of events may fit several of the
scenarios found in our general classification scheme. However, we have to await
further evidence showing that the NQR anomalies at T* = 13.5K are associated

goal of developing a more complete understanding of how dense particulate
systems respond to applied shear. In particular, we are interested in
determining when these systems will possess linear velocity profiles and when
they will develop highly localized velocity profiles in response to shear. In
previous work on similar systems we showed that nonlinear velocity profiles
form when the speed of the shearing boundary exceeds the speed of shear waves
in the material. However, we find that nonlinear velocity profiles in these
systems are unstable at very long times. The degree of nonlinearity slowly
decreases in time; the velocity profiles become linear when the granular
temperature and density profiles are uniform across the system at long times.
We measure the time $t_l$ required for the velocity profiles to become linear
and find that $t_l$ increases as a power-law with the speed of the shearing
boundary and increases rapidly as the packing fraction approaches random close
packing. We also performed simulations in which differences in the granular
temperature across the system were maintained by vertically vibrating one of
the boundaries during shear flow. We find that nonlinear velocity profiles form
and are stable at long times if the difference in the granular temperature
across the system exceeds a threshold value that is comparable to the glass
transition temperature in an equilibrium system at the same average density.
Finally, the sheared and vibrated systems form stable shear bands, or highly
localized velocity profiles, when the applied shear stress is lowered below the
yield stress of the static part of the system.

timelike 4-velocity field of dust in cosmological models in Einstein's theory.
Using the Rosen-Sorkin Lagrange multiplier trick, I complete Anna Maidens's
argument that the problem is not solved by prohibiting variation of absolute
objects in an action principle. Recalling Anderson's proscription of
""irrelevant"" variables, I generalize that proscription to locally irrelevant
variables that do no work in some places in some models. This move vindicates
Friedman's intuitions and removes the Jones-Geroch counterexample: some regions
of some models of gravity with dust are dust-free and so naturally lack a
timelike 4-velocity, so diffeomorphic equivalence to (1,0,0,0) is spoiled.
Torretti's example involving constant curvature spaces is shown to have an
absolute object on Anderson's analysis, viz., the conformal spatial metric
density. The previously neglected threat of an absolute object from an
orthonormal tetrad used for coupling spinors to gravity appears resolvable by
eliminating irrelevant fields. However, given Anderson's definition, GTR itself
has an absolute object (as Robert Geroch has observed recently): a change of
variables to a conformal metric density and a scalar density shows that the
latter is absolute.

method can be considered as a simple and alternative way to the Renormalisation
Group (R.G.) approach and when applied to QED-lagrangian is able to obtain in a
first approximation both the running coupling constant behavior of alpha(mu)
and the mass m(mu).The calculations are evaluated just at d_c=4, where d_c is
the upper critical dimension of the problem, so that we obtain the logarithmic
behavior both for the coupling alpha and the excess of mass Delta m on the
energy scale mu. Although our results are well-known in the vast literature of
field theories,it seems that one of the advantages of Thompson's method, beyond
its simplicity is that it is able to extract directly from QED-lagrangian the
physical (finite) behavior of alpha(mu) and m(mu), bypassing hard problems of
divergences which normally appear in the conventional renormalisation schemes
applied to field theories like QED. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is also
treated by the present method in order to obtain the quark condensate value.
Besides this, the method is also able to evaluate the vacuum pressure at the
boundary of the nucleon. This is done by assumming a step function behavior for
the running coupling constant of the QCD, which fits nicely to some quantities
related to the strong interaction evaluated through the MIT-bag model.

quark-antiquark bound states is derived from Quantum Chromodynamics. Different
from the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the equation derived is a kind of first-order
differential equations of Schr\""odinger-type in the position space. Especially,
the interaction kernel in the equation is given by two different closed
expressions. One expression which contains only a few types of Green's
functions is derived with the aid of the equations of motion satisfied by some
kinds of Green's functions. Another expression which is represented in terms of
the quark, antiquark and gluon propagators and some kinds of proper vertices is
derived by means of the technique of irreducible decomposition of Green's
functions. The kernel derived not only can easily be calculated by the
perturbation method, but also provides a suitable basis for nonperturbative
investigations. Furthermore, it is shown that the four-dimensinal
Dirac-Schr\""odinger equation and its kernel can directly be reduced to rigorous
three-dimensional forms in the equal-time Lorentz frame and the
Dirac-Schr\""odinger equation can be reduced to an equivalent
Pauli-Schr\""odinger equation which is represented in the Pauli spinor space. To
show the applicability of the closed expressions derived and to demonstrate the
equivalence between the two different expressions of the kernel, the t-channel
and s-channel one gluon exchange kernels are chosen as an example to show how
they are derived from the closed expressions. In addition, the connection of
the Dirac-Schr\""odinger equation with the Bethe-Salpeter equation is discussed.

physics of the concept of a surface with constant and negative Gaussian
curvature. In his outstanding 1868 paper Beltrami discussed how non-Euclidean
geometry is actually realized and displayed in a disk on the plane. This metric
is intrinsically defined and definite but only if indefinite metrics are
introduced it is possible to fully understand the structure of pseudospheres.
In a 3D flat space R^3 the fundamental quadric is introduced, with the same
signature as the metric of R^3; this leads to 3 kinds of surfaces with constant
Gaussian curvature: the sphere, the single-sheet hyperboloid and the two-sheet
hyperboloid; the last one is shown to be isomorphic to Beltrami's disk. The
spacetime corresponding to the single-sheet case is de Sitter cosmological
model, which, due to its symmetry, has an important role in cosmology. When two
of the three fundamental quadrics are combined, a simple, yet deep, solution of
Einstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to a uniform electromagnetic field is
obtained with many applications in mathematical physics. One of them is a ""no
go"" theorem: when one tries to frame a Riemannian four-dimensional manifold in
a Kahlerian structure, it is found that, while this is generically possible
with a definite signature, in spacetime only BR fulfills the requirement. The
BR metric plays an important role in the exploration of new principles in
fundamental physical theories; we briefly mention some examples related to the
horizon of a black hole and the dilaton in string theory.

of simple periodic orbits (SPOs) representing in-phase (IPM) and out-of-phase
motion (OPM), which are known in closed form and whose linear stability can be
analyzed exactly. Our results verify that as the energy E increases for fixed
N, beyond the destabilization threshold of these orbits, all positive Lyapunov
exponents exhibit a transition between two power laws, occurring at the same
value of E. The destabilization energy E_c per particle goes to zero as N goes
to infinity following a simple power-law. However, using SALI, a very efficient
indicator we have recently introduced for distinguishing order from chaos, we
find that the two Hamiltonians have very different dynamics near their stable
SPOs: For example, in the case of the FPU system, as the energy increases for
fixed N, the islands of stability around the OPM decrease in size, the orbit
destabilizes through period-doubling bifurcation and its eigenvalues move
steadily away from -1, while for the BEC model the OPM has islands around it
which grow in size before it bifurcates through symmetry breaking, while its
real eigenvalues return to +1 at very high energies. Still, when calculating
Lyapunov spectra, we find for the OPMs of both Hamiltonians that the Lyapunov
exponents decrease following an exponential law and yield extensive
Kolmogorov--Sinai entropies per particle, in the thermodynamic limit of fixed
energy density E/N with E and N arbitrarily large.

electronic and structural properties of a key eumelanin precursor -
5,6,-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and its dimeric forms. We have
used optical spectroscopy to follow the oxidative polymerization of DHICA to
eumelanin, and observe red shifting and broadening of the absorption spectrum
as the reaction proceeds. First principles density functional theory
calculations indicate that DHICA oligomers (possible reaction products of
oxidative polymerization) have red shifted HOMO-LUMO gaps with respect to the
monomer. Furthermore, different bonding configurations (leading to oligomers
with different structures) produce a range of gaps. These experimental and
theoretical results lend support to the chemical disorder model where the broad
band monotonic absorption characteristic of all melanins is a consequence of
the superposition of a large number of inhomogeneously broadened Gaussian
transitions associated with each of the components of a melanin ensemble. These
results suggest that the traditional model of eumelanin as an amorphous organic
semiconductor is not required to explain its optical properties, and should be
thoroughly re-examined. These results have significant implications for our
understanding of the physics, chemistry and biological function of these
important biological macromolecules. Indeed, one may speculate that the robust
