Survey (BQS) is complete and representative of the general quasar population by
comparing with imaging and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A
comparison of SDSS and PG photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the need
to apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the PG data. Using the SDSS
photometric catalog, we define the PG's parent sample of objects that are not
main-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parent
sample using the PG photometric criteria and errors. This simulation shows that
the effective U-B cut in the PG survey is U-B < -0.71 (rather than the intended
U-B < -0.44), implying a color-related incompleteness. As the color
distribution of bright quasars peaks near U-B=-0.7 and the 2-sigma error in U-B
is comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the color
incompleteness of the BQS is approximately 50% and essentially random with
respect to U-B color for z<0.5. There is, however, a bias against bright
quasars at 0.5 < z < 1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation of
quasars (although quasars at z>0.5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in any
case). We find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness when
comparing the distributions in color, redshift, and FIRST radio properties of
the BQS and a BQS-like subsample of the SDSS quasar sample. However, the
application of a bright magnitude limit biases the BQS toward the inclusion of
objects which are blue in g-i, in particular compared to the full range of g-i
colors found among the i-band limited SDSS quasars, and even at i-band
magnitudes comparable to those of the BQS objects.

in latitude and the existence of a tipping instability (longitudinal m=1 mode)
for any time during the solar cycle. To determine the extent which we can
recover the toroidal field dynamics, we forward model artificially generated
sunspot distributions from subsurface toroidal fields we assigned certain
properties. We analyzed two sunspot distribution parameters using MDI and model
data: the average latitudinal separation of sunspot pairs as a function of
longitudinal separation, and the number of sunspot pairs creating a given angle
with respect to the E-W direction. A toroidal band of 10 degrees width with a
constant tipping of 5 degrees best fits MDI data early in the solar cycle. A
toroidal band of 20 degrees width with a tipping amplitude decreasing in time
from 5 to 0 degrees best fits MDI data late in the solar cycle. Model data
generated by untipped toroidal bands cannot fit MDI high latitude data and can
fit only one parameter at low latitudes. Tipped toroidal bands satisfy chi
squared criteria at both high and low latitudes. We conclude this is evidence
to reject the null hypothesis - that toroidal bands in the solar tachocline do
not experience a tipping instability - in favor of the hypothesis that the
toroidal band experiences an m=1 tipping instability. Our finding that the band
widens from ~10 degrees early in the solar cycle to ~20 degrees late in the

data accumulated with the SPI spectrometer aboard ESA's INTEGRAL gamma-ray
observatory, that covers approximately 95% of the celestial sphere. 511 keV
line emission is significantly detected towards the galactic bulge region and,
at a very low level, from the galactic disk. The bulge emission is highly
symmetric and is centred on the galactic centre with an extension of 8 deg. The
emission is equally well described by models that represent the stellar bulge
or halo populations. The disk morphology is only weakly constrained by the
present data, being compatible with both the distribution of young and old
stellar populations. The 511 keV line flux from the bulge and disk components
is 1.05e-3 ph cm-2 s-1 and 0.7e-3 ph cm-2 s-1, respectively, corresponding to a
bulge-to-disk flux ratio in the range 1-3. Assuming a positronium fraction of
0.93 this translates into annihilation rates of 1.5e43 s-1 and 3e42 s-1,
respectively. The ratio of the bulge luminosity to that of the disk is in the
range 3-9. We find no evidence for a point-like source in addition to the
diffuse emission, down to a typical flux limit of 1e-4 ph cm-2 s-1. We also
find no evidence for the positive latitude enhancement that has been reported
from OSSE measurements; our 3 sigma upper flux limit for this feature is 1.5e-4
ph cm-2 s-1. The disk emission can be attributed to the beta+ decay of the
radioactive species 26Al and 44Ti. The bulge emission arises from a different
source which has only a weak or no disk component. We suggest that Type Ia
supernovae and/or low-mass X-ray binaries are the prime candidates for the
source of the galactic bulge positrons. Light dark matter annihilation could
also explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission characteristics.

of a turbulent dynamo driven by convection to characterize the dynamic
behavior, magnetic field strengths, and filling factors in a non-rotating
stratified medium, and to predict these magnetic properties at the surface of
cool stars. We use simple applications of stellar structure theory for the
convective envelopes of main-sequence stars to scale our simulations to the
outer layers of stars in the F0--M0 spectral range, which allows us to estimate
the unsigned magnetic flux on the surface of non-rotating reference stars. With
these estimates we use the recent results of \citet{Pevtsov03} to predict the
level of X-ray emission from such a turbulent dynamo, and find that our results
compare well with observed lower limits of surface X-ray flux. If we scale our
predicted X-ray fluxes to \ion{Mg}{2} fluxes we also find good agreement with
the observed lower limit of chromospheric emission in K dwarfs. This suggests
that dynamo action from a convecting, non-rotating plasma is a viable
alternative to acoustic heating models as an explanation for the basal emission
level seen in chromospheric, transition region, and coronal diagnostics from

stronger systematic requirements. For example, for a SNAP-type survey the
multiplicative error in shear needs to be smaller than 1%(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2} of
the mean shear in any given redshift bin, while the centroids of photometric
redshift bins need to be known to better than 0.003(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2}. With
about a factor of two degradation in cosmological parameter errors, future
surveys can enter a self-calibration regime, where the mean systematic biases

The observed emission consists of a dominant non-thermal component, which is
eclipsed for a portion of the orbit, and a thermal component, which appears to
be persistent. We propose that the non-thermal X-rays originate in a
relativistic intrabinary shock, formed due to interaction between the
relativistic particle wind from the pulsar and matter from the main-sequence
companion star, while the thermal photons are from the heated magnetic polar
caps of the millisecond pulsar. At optical wavelengths, the emission exhibits
large-amplitude variations at the orbital period, which can be attributed to
heating of one side of the tidally-locked secondary star by the pulsar wind.
The observed X-ray and optical properties of PSR J0024--7204W are remarkably
similar to those of the low mass X-ray binary and X-ray millisecond pulsar SAX
J1808.4--3658 in quiescence. This supports the conjecture that the non-thermal
X-ray emission and optical modulations seen in the SAX J1808.4--3658 system in
a quiescent state are due to interaction between the wind from a reactivated
rotation-powered pulsar and matter from the companion star. The striking
similarities between the two systems provide support for the long-sought

systems.

These conclusions are corroborated by a large number of nonlinear numerical
simulations with two different parameterized prescriptions for the initial

Richardson number required for marginal stability is more than an order of
magnitude larger than the traditional 1/4 value. The dominant modes that grow
have horizontal wavelengths of several initial dust scale heights, and in
nonlinear stages mix solids fairly homogeneously over a comparable vertical

dispersion (M-sigma) relation over cosmic time using simulations of galaxy

mergers of galaxies varying the properties of the progenitors to match those
expected at redshifts z=0-6. We find that the slope of the resulting M-sigma
relation is the same at all redshifts considered. For the same feedback
efficiency that reproduces the observed amplitude of the M-sigma relation at
z=0, there is a weak redshift-dependence to the normalization that results from
an increasing velocity dispersion for a given galactic stellar mass. We develop
a formalism to connect redshift evolution in the M-sigma relation to the
scatter in the local relation at z=0. We show that the scatter in the local
relation places severe constraints on the redshift evolution of both the
normalization and slope of the M-sigma relation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that cosmic downsizing introduces a black hole mass-dependent dispersion in the
M-sigma relation and that the skewness of the distribution about the locally
observed M-sigma relation is sensitive to redshift evolution in the
normalization and slope. In principle, these various diagnostics provide a
method for differentiating between theories for producing the M-sigma relation.

selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) to deduce details about
star formation in nearby disk galaxies selected with no bias to optical surface
brightness selection effects. Broad (B and R) and narrow band (H-alpha) images
were obtained for all of these objects. More than half of the sample galaxies
are late-type, dwarf disks (mostly Sc and Sm galaxies). We have measured the
properties of the HII regions on H-alpha, continuum subtracted images, using
the HIIphot package developed by Thilker et al. 2000. All but one of the
galaxies contained at least one detectable HII region. Examination of the
properties of the HII regions in each galaxy revealed that the brightest
regions in higher surface brightness galaxies tend to be more luminous than
those in lower surface brightness galaxies. A higher fraction (referred to as
the diffuse fraction) of the H-alpha emission from lower surface brightness
galaxies comes from diffuse ionized gas (DIG). HII region luminosity functions
(LFs) co-added according to surface brightness show that the shapes of the LFs
for the lowest surface brightness galaxies are different from those for typical
spiral galaxies. This discrepancy could be caused by the lowest surface
brightness galaxies having somewhat episodic star formation or by them forming
a relatively larger fraction of their stars outside of dense, massive molecular
clouds. In general, the results imply that the conditions under which star
formation occurs in lower surface brightness galaxies are different than in
more typical, higher surface brightness spiral galaxies.

around redshift z=6 with SMBH masses of billion solar masses, we assess the
possibility of an early phase of stable super-critical quasi-spherical
accretion in the BHs hosted by metal free halos with virial temperature larger
than 10000 K. We assume that the first `seed' black holes formed with
intermediate masses following the collapse of the first generation of stars, in
mini-halos collapsing at z=20-30 from high peaks of density fluctuations. In
high redshift halos with virial temperature larger than 10000 K, conditions
exist for the formation of a fat disc of gas at T_gas=5000-10000 K. Cooling via
hydrogen atomic lines is in fact effective in these comparatively massive
halos. The cooling and collapse of an initially spherical configuration of gas
leads to a rotationally supported disc at the center of the halo if baryons
preserve their specific angular momentum during collapse. The conditions for
the formation of the gas disc and accretion onto a central black holes out of
this supply of gas are investigated, as well as the feedback of the emission
onto the host and onto the intergalactic medium. We find that even a short
phase of supercritical accretion eases the requirements set by the z=6 quasars.

fits show that, since $z = 1$, $M^*_B$ dims by $\sim$ 1.3 mag per unit redshift
for both color classes, $\phi^*$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while
$\phi^*$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. At face value, the
number density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since $ z = 1$,
whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both
conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data
and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest.
We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after $z = 1$
from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties
of local and distant E/S0s. We suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some blue
galaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the
red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in
one or more purely stellar mergers. E/S0s of a given mass today will have
formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the
fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.

expected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of
the contrast in redshifted 21cm emission between a large HII region and the
surrounding neutral IGM will be the simplest and most easily interpreted
signature. We find that an instrument like the planned Mileura Widefield Array
Low-Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) will be able to obtain good signal to noise on
HII regions around the most luminous quasars, and determine some gross
geometric properties, e.g. whether the HII region is spherical or conical. A
hypothetical follow-up instrument with 10 times the collecting area of the LFD
(MWA-5000) will be capable of mapping the detailed geometry of HII regions,
while SKA will be capable of detecting very narrow spectral features as well as
the sharpness of the HII region boundary. The MWA-5000 will discover
serendipitous HII regions in widefield observations. We estimate the number of
HII regions which are expected to be generated by quasars. Assuming a late
reionization at z~6 we find that there should be several tens of quasar HII
regions larger than 4Mpc at z~6-8 per field of view. Identification of HII
regions in forthcoming 21cm surveys can guide a search for bright galaxies in
the middle of these regions. Most of the discovered galaxies would be the
massive hosts of dormant quasars that left behind fossil HII cavities that
persisted long after the quasar emission ended, owing to the long recombination
time of intergalactic hydrogen. A snap-shot survey of candidate HII regions
selected in redshifted 21cm image cubes may prove to be the most efficient
method for finding very high redshift quasars and galaxies.

derive a dynamical mass of 7 x 10^9 M_sun and a dark-to-luminous mass ratio of

very sensitive and homogenous X-ray data on a uniquely large sample of 481
optically well-characterized low-extinction low-mass members of the Orion
Nebula Cluster, for which individual stellar masses and ages could be
determined. More than 98 percent of the stars in this sample are detected as
X-ray sources. Within the PMS phase for stellar ages in the range $\sim 0.1-10$
Myr, we establish a mild decay in activity with stellar age $\tau$ roughly as
$L_{\rm X} \propto \tau^{-1/3}$. On longer timescales, when the Orion stars are
compared to main sequence stars, the X-ray luminosity decay law for stars in
the $0.5 < M < 1.2$ M$_\odot$ mass range is more rapid with $L_{\rm X} \propto
\tau^{-0.75}$ over the wide range of ages $5 < \log \tau < 9.5$ yr. The
magnetic activity history for M stars with masses $0.1 < M < 0.4 M_\odot$ is
distinctly different. Only a mild decrease in X-ray luminosity, and even a mild
increase in $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$ and $F_{\rm X}$, is seen over the 1-100 Myr
range, though the X-ray emission does decay over long timescales on the main
sequence. Together with COUP results on the absence of a rotation-activity
relation in Orion stars, we find that the activity-age decay is strong across
the entire history of solar-type stars but is not attributable to rotational
deceleration during the early epochs. A combination of tachocline and
distributed convective dynamos may be operative in young solar-type stars. The
results for the lowest mass stars are most easily understood by the dominance

of some sources could be due to a gyrosynchroton mechanism arising from
coronally active young stars. The Serpens VLA sources are spatially distributed
into two groups; one of them located towards the NW clump of the Serpens core,
where only Class 0 and Class I protostars are found to present cm emission, and
a second group located towards the SE clump, where radio continuum sources are

ongoing search for cataclysmic variables in the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The
orbital and white dwarf spin periods determined from time-resolved photometry
and spectroscopy are Porb ~= 250 min and Pspin = 69.171 +- 0.001 min,
respectively. The combination of a large ratio Pspin/Porb ~= 0.3 and a long
orbital period is very unusual compared to the other known intermediate polars.
The magnetic moment of the white dwarf is estimated to be mu1 ~ 10^{34} G cm^3,
which is in the typical range of polars. Our extensive photometry shows that HS
0943+1404 enters into deep (~ 3 mag) low states, which are also a
characteristic feature of polars. We therefore suggest that the system is a
true ``intermediate'' polar that will eventually synchronise, that is, a
transitional object between intermediate polars and polars. The optical
spectrum of HS 0943+1404 also exhibits a number of unusual emission lines, most
noticeably NII 5680, which is likely to reflect enhanced nitrogen abundances in
the envelope of the secondary.

The rotation is sub-Keplerian, and the molecular gas is not in a rotationally

up version of low mass star formation. Instead, our observations suggest a
different mode of clustered massive star formation, in which the accretion flow
flattens but does not form an accretion disk. Also in this mode of star

resolution spectra of QSOs are investigated using the model of formation and
evolution of DM structure elements based on the Zel'dovich theory. This model
asserts that absorbers are formed in the course of both linear and nonlinear
adiabatic or shock compression of dark matter (DM) and gaseous matter. It
allows us to link the column density and overdensity of DM and gaseous
components with the observed column density of neutral hydrogen, redshifts and
Doppler parameters of absorbers and demonstrates that at high redshifts we
observe a self similar period of structure evolution with the Gaussian initial
perturbations. We show that the colder absorbers are associated with rapidly
expanded regions of a galactic scale which represent large amplitude negative
density perturbations.
  We extend and improve the method of measuring the power spectrum of initial
perturbations proposed in Demia\'nski & Doroshkevich (2003b). Our method links
the observed separations and the DM column density of absorbers with the
correlation function of the initial velocity field. We recover the cold dark
matter (CDM) like power spectrum at scales 10> D > 0.15Mpc/h with a precision
of ~15%. However at scales $\sim 3 - 150 h^{-1}$kpc the measured and CDM--like
spectra are different. This result suggests a possible complex inflation with
generation of excess power at small scales.

some type of wide-angle outflow or wind. We estimate that the infall component

rule out alternative models such as those with modified dynamics. Here, we
demonstrate how they might be observed in the weak lensing data. We evaluate
the shear distortion and show that its radial profile is marked by a
characteristic sawtooth pattern due to the caustics in dark matter haloes that
form by selfsimilar accretion. We discuss the observational complications,
mainly due to the poor knowledge of the virial radii of the haloes and
demonstrate that a superposition of about 300 cluster-size haloes would give a
signal-to-noise ratio which is sufficiently large for the detection of caustics
with ground-based observations. This number is reduced to 100 for space-based
observations. These bounds can be easily achieved by the ongoing wide field

Bose-Einstein condensation is not expected to be realized. Nevertheless, first
experimental indications supporting the formation of the condensate in low

external trapping potential. Theoretical predictions, made for homogeneous
systems, require therefore careful reexamination.

tubes with an antiferromagnetic (AF) intrachain coupling. In the odd-leg tubes,
the AF rung coupling causes the frustration. To treat all ladders and tubes
systematically, we apply S\'en\'echal's method [Phys. Rev. B 52, 15319 (1995)],
based on the nonlinear sigma model. This strategy is valid in the weak
interchain (rung) coupling regime. We show that all frustrated tubes possess
six-fold degenerate spin-1 magnon bands, as the lowest excitations, while other
ladders and tubes have a standard triply degenerate bands. We also consider
effects of four kinds of Zeeman terms: uniform, staggered only along the rung,
only along the chain, or both directions. The above prediction of the no-field
case implies that a sufficiently strong uniform field yields a two-component
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) due to the condensation of doubly degenerate
lowest magnons in frustrated tubes. In contrast, the field induces a standard
one-component TLL in all other systems. This is supported by symmetry and
bosonization arguments based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The bosonization
also suggests that the two-component TLL vanishes and a one-component TLL
appears, when the uniform field becomes larger for the second lowest magnon
bands to touch the zero-energy line. This transition could be observed as a
cusp singularity in the magnetization process. All the analyses for the systems
with a staggered Zeeman term suggest that the emergence of the doubly
degenerate transverse magnons and the single longitudinal one is universal for
the one-dimensional AF spin systems with weak staggered field.

describe how various propagators for finite-domain constraints can be
implemented in it. An action rule specifies a pattern for agents, an action
that the agents can carry out, and an event pattern for events that can
activate the agents. AR combines the goal-oriented execution model of logic
programming with the event-driven execution model. This hybrid execution model
facilitates programming constraint propagators. A propagator for a constraint
is an agent that maintains the consistency of the constraint and is activated
by the updates of the domain variables in the constraint. AR has a much
stronger descriptive power than {\it indexicals}, the language widely used in
the current finite-domain constraint systems, and is flexible for implementing
not only interval-consistency but also arc-consistency algorithms. As examples,
we present a weak arc-consistency propagator for the {\tt all\_distinct}

any neutrino involved would mark physics beyond the Standard Model. This is
because in such decay modes lepton number conservation would be violated and
the neutrino would reveal itself as being its own antiparticle, thereby of
Majorana type. So far, the experimental focus has mostly been on the double
beta minus decay variant, where one attempts to measure the spectrum of the two
emitted electrons. A discrete line at the endpoint energy marks the unique
signature for a Majorana neutrino. Little attention has been given to
alternative decay modes in double-beta decay. In this note we show that there
is at least one case in the periodic table, where the parent in the
neutrinoless double-electron capture process is nearly degenerate with an
excited state in the daughter, leading to a possible enhancement of the decay
rate by several orders of magnitude. It is the nucleus 74-Se, which has this
unique property. Furthermore, there is an easy to detect 2 gamma-ray decay
cascade in 74-Ge, which follows the zero-neutrino double electron capture, and
which by its mere detection provides unique signature of the Majorana neutrino.

massless, or light, excitations arising from their embedding in color and
flavor space. This opens up the possibility that colliding strings miss each
other in the internal space, reducing the probability of reconnection. We study
the topology of the non-abelian vortex moduli space to determine the outcome of
string collision. Surprisingly we find that the probability of classical
reconnection in this system remains unity, with strings passing through each
other only for finely tuned initial conditions. We proceed to show how this
conclusion can be changed by symmetry breaking effects, or by quantum effects
associated to fermionic zero modes, and present examples where the probability
of reconnection in a U(N) gauge theory ranges from 1/N for low-energy
collisions to one at higher energies.

traversable horizons and the entirety of the spacetime can be mapped out. We
review Weyl techniques and as examples we systematically discuss properties of
a variety of solutions including Kerr-Newman black holes, black rings,
expanding bubbles, and recent spacelike-brane solutions. Families of solutions
will share qualitatively similar cards. In addition we show how card diagrams
not only capture information about a geometry but also its analytic

connections or multivector fields solutions to the field equations in a general
framework: a pre-multisymplectic fibre bundle (which will be identified with
the first-order jet bundle and the multimomentum bundle when Lagrangian and

prediction. The former predominantly uses the data in the recent history while
the latter mainly relies on historical information. The question of combining
these two pieces of valuable information is an interesting challenge in
statistics. We surmount this problem via dynamically integrating information
from both the time and the state domains. The estimators from both domains are
optimally combined based on a data driven weighting strategy, which provides a
more efficient estimator of volatility. Asymptotic normality is seperately
established for the time damain, the state domain, and the integrated
estimators. By comparing the efficiency of the estimators, it is demonstrated
that the proposed integrated estimator uniformly dominates the two other
estimators. The proposed dynamic integration approach is also applicable to
other estimation problems in time series. Extensive simulations are conducted
to demonstrate that the newly proposed procedure outperforms some popular ones

  Mathematische Annalen",,,,"math.DG hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  A new definition of canonical conformal differential operators $P_k$
($k=1,2,...)$, with leading term a $k^{\rm th}$ power of the Laplacian, is
given for conformally Einstein manifolds of any signature. These act between
density bundles and, more generally, between weighted tractor bundles of any
rank. By construction these factor into a power of a fundamental Laplacian
associated to Einstein metrics. There are natural conformal Laplacian operators
on density bundles due to Graham-Jenne-Mason-Sparling (GJMS). It is shown that
on conformally Einstein manifolds these agree with the $P_k$ operators and
hence on Einstein manifolds the GJMS operators factor into a product of second
order Laplacian type operators. In even dimension $n$ the GJMS operators are
defined only for $1\leq k\leq n/2$ and so, on conformally Einstein manifolds,
the $P_{k}$ give an extension of this family of operators to operators of all
even orders. For $n$ even and $k>n/2$ the operators $P_k$ are given by a
natural formula in terms of an Einstein metric but are not natural as
conformally invariant operators. They are shown to be nevertheless canonical
objects on conformally Einstein structures. There are generalisations of these
results to operators between weighted tractor bundles. It is shown that on
Einstein manifolds the Branson Q-curvature is constant and an explicit formula
for the constant is given in terms of the scalar curvature. As part of
development, conformally invariant tractor equations equivalent to the
conformal Killing equation are presented.

is a tungsten crystal oriented on the <111> axis, has been studied at CERN in
the WA103 experiment. In such sources the photons which create the $e^+ e^-$
pairs result from channeling radiation and coherent bremsstrahlung. In this
experiment electron beams of 6 and 10 GeV were sent on different kinds of
targets: a 4 mm thick crystal, a 8 mm thick crystal and a compound taraget (4
mm crystal + 4 mm amorphous disk). An amorphous tungsten target 20 mm thick was
also used for comparison with the 8 mm crystal. Tracks of outgoing charged
particles were detected and analyzed by a drift chamber in a magnetic field.
The energy and angle spectra of the positrons were obtained for energies up to
150 MeV and angles up to 30 degrees. The measured positron distribution in
momentum space (longitudinal versus transverse) is also presented, giving a
full momentum space description of the source. Results on outgoing photons are
also presented. A significant enhancement of both photon and positron
production is clearly observed. At 10 GeV incident energy, the positron
enhancement factor is 4 for the 4 mm crystal, about 2 for the 8 mm crystal.
Besides, the simulation code for the crystal processes is validated by a quite
good agreement between the simulated and experimental spectra, both for
positrons and photons.

with respect to other things. Then a new conjecture of antigravity --the
repulsive force between matter and antimatter derived from the modified

particle-antiparticle symmetry based on a new understanding about the essence
of special relativity. Its possible consequences in the theory of cosmology are
discussed briefly, including a new explanation for the accelerating universe

translation, one needs to uncover the mechanisms controlling the
configurational changes of nucleic acids. As a step toward this aim, we present
here a novel mesoscopic-level computational model that provides a new window
into nucleic acid dynamics. We model a single-stranded nucleic as a polymer
chain whose monomers are the nucleosides. Each monomer comprises a bead
representing the sugar molecule and a pin representing the base. The bead-pin
complex can rotate about the backbone of the chain. We consider pairwise
stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions. We use a modified Monte Carlo
dynamics that splits the dynamics into translational bead motion and rotational
pin motion. By performing a number of tests we first show that our model is
physically sound. We then focus on the study of a the kinetics of a DNA
hairpin--a single-stranded molecule comprising two complementary segments
joined by a non-complementary loop--studied experimentally. We find that
results from our simulations agree with experimental observations,
demonstrating that our model is a suitable tool for the investigation of the
hybridization of single strands.

that the gate operations are irreversible if there is a difference in the

problem consists in finding a local minimum of the function f on G, that is a
vertex v such that f(v) is not larger than the value of f on the neighbors of v
in G. In this note, we first prove a separation theorem slightly stronger than
the one of Gilbert, Hutchinson and Tarjan for graphs of constant genus. This
result allows us to enhance a previously known deterministic algorithm for
Local Search with query complexity O(\log n)\cdot d+O(\sqrt{g})\cdot\sqrt{n},
so that we obtain a deterministic query complexity of
d+O(\sqrt{g})\cdot\sqrt{n}, where n is the size of G, d is its maximum degree,
and $g$ is its genus. We also give a quantum version of our algorithm, whose
query complexity is of O(\sqrt{d})+O(\sqrt[4]{g})\cdot\sqrt[4]{n}\log\log n.
Our deterministic and quantum algorithms have query complexities respectively
smaller than the generic algorithms of Aldous and of Aaronson for large classes
of graphs, including graphs of bounded genus and planar graphs. Independently
from this work, Zhang has recently given a quantum algorithm which finds a
local minimum on the planar grid over \{1,...,\sqrt{n}\}^2 using
O(\sqrt[4]{n}(\log\log n)^2) queries. Our quantum algorithm can be viewed as a
strongly generalized, and slightly enhanced version of this algorithm.
