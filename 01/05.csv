power spectrum can constrain the matter density parameter Omega_m and the
linear matter fluctuation amplitude sigma_8. We improve on previous treatments
by adopting a fully non-linear description of galaxy clustering and bias, which
allows us to break parameter degeneracies by combining large-scale and small-
scale distortions. We consider different combinations of Omega_m and sigma_8
and find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that yield
nearly identical galaxy correlation functions in real space. We use these HOD
parameters to populate the dark matter halos of large N-body simulations, from
which we measure redshift-space distortions on small and large scales. We
include a velocity bias parameter alpha_v that allows the velocity dispersions
of satellite galaxies in halos to be systematically higher or lower than those
of dark matter. Large-scale distortions are determined by the parameter
combination beta = Omega_m^{0.6}/b_g, where b_g is the galaxy bias, in
agreement with linear theory. However, linear theory does not accurately
describe the distortions themselves on scales accessible to our simulations. We
provide fitting formulas to estimate beta from the redshift-space correlation
function or power spectrum, and we show that these formulas are significantly
more accurate than those in the existing literature. On small scales, the
``finger-of-god'' distortions at projected separations ~0.1 Mpc/h depend on
Omega_m*alpha_v^2 but are independent of sigma_8, while at intermediate
separations they depend on sigma_8 as well. One can thus use redshift-space
distortions over a wide range of scales to separately determine Omega_m,
sigma_8, and alpha_v. (Abridged)

measured from about 3000 AGN included in the main galaxy sample of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey within a redshift range of $0<z<0.15$. The $\Ha$ and
[OIII]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for Seyferts cover luminosity range
of $10^{5-9}$$L_\odot$ in H$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken power
laws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. Assuming a universal
conversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred B
band magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the AGN luminosity
function of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity function
derived from the 2dF redshift survey. The inferred AGN number density is
approximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the total
light of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. The numbers
of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at high
luminosity, Seyfert 1s outnumber Seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. In making the
luminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity is
independent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it a
posteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. Given the relationship
between black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack of
correlation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variable
that determines the AGN luminosity is the Eddington ratio, not the black hole
mass. This appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likely
to be shining near the Eddington limit.

attributes the OVI (and OVII X-ray absorption) to cosmological structures of

enormous required mass of gas (4x10^12 M_solar). Our detection, in 9 of 12

probably cooling, multiphase gas in the Galactic halo, bow-shocks and
interfaces between clouds falling through a hot, rotating gaseous halo. The

The accuracy of the absolute astrometry offered by the VLBA allows very precise

The proper motion derived from our VLBA observations agrees with that measured
with the VLA over a similar period to better than 2 mas yr$^{-1}$, and is fully
consistent with the infrared proper motion of T Tau Sb, the pre-main sequence M

also, as matrix, which is approximately solar in composition, is unlikely to be
a mixture of genetically unrelated materials with different compositions. Since
chondrules cooled at 10-1000 K/h, and matrix and chondrules are chemically
complementary, most matrix silicates probably formed close to chondrules in
transient heating events. Shock heating is favored as nebular shocks capable of
melting millimeter-sized aggregates vaporize dust. The crystalline and
amorphous silicates in the primitive chondrite matrices share many
characteristic features with silicates in chondritic interplanetary dust
particles suggesting that most of the crystalline silicates and possibly some
amorphous silicates in the interplanetary dust particles are also nebular
condensates. Except for small amounts of refractory oxides that formed with
Ca-Al-rich inclusions at the inner edge of the disk and presolar dust, most of

both classes, GPS and CSO, represent a small fraction of the flux limited and

thermally unstable or even violent nuclear reactions in a geometrically

efficient mass increase of white dwarfs by hydrogen and/or helium accretion has
been seriously questioned. A good understanding of the stability of
thermonuclear shell sources is therefore crucial in order to investigate the
evolution of accreting white dwarfs as SNe Ia progenitors. Here, we present a
quantitative criterion for the thermal stability of thermonuclear shell
sources, and discuss the effects of rotation on the stability of helium shell
burning in helium accreting CO white dwarfs with Mdot \approx 10^{-7} ...

momentum transfer from the accreted gas mass onto the bodies. We integrate an
ensemble of triple systems within a certain volume with different accretion
rates, assuming several prescriptions of how momentum is transferred onto the

the end states and decay times of these systems and determine the fraction of
Brown Dwarfs formed, their escape speeds as well as the semi-major axis
distribution of the formed Brown Dwarf binaries. We find that the formation
probability of Brown Dwarfs depends strongly on the assumed momentum transfer
which is related to the motion of the gas. Due to ongoing accretion and
consequent shrinkage of the systems, the median escape velocity is increased by
a factor of 2 and the binary separations are decreased by a factor of 5
compared with non-accreting systems. Furthermore, the obtained semi-major axis
distribution drops off sharply to either side of the median, which is also

much better. In order to avoid pitfalls inherent to the LDA+U method, a careful
strategy had to be used, which will be described in detail. The lanthanide 4f
spin moment is found to couple antiferromagnetically to the magnetization of
the Fe lattice, in agreement with the model of Campbell and Brooks. There is
strong evidence for a delocalization/localization transition that is shifted

terms of the effective pressure felt by lanthanides in Fe. Implications for
resolving ambiguities in the determination of delocalization in pure lanthanide

and tabu/scatter search, to the optimisation of realistic portfolios. The model
is based on the classical mean-variance approach, but enhanced with floor and
ceiling constraints, cardinality constraints and nonlinear transaction costs
which include a substantial illiquidity premium.
  It is shown that genetic algorithms can optimise such portfolios effectively
and within reasonable times. This approach also copes easily with extensive
modifications such as the addition of more intricate constraints, discontinuous
variables and more complex objective functions.
  The results indicate that that both floor and ceiling constraints have a
substantial negative impact on portfolio performance and should be examined
critically. Another insight is that nonlinear transaction costs which are
comparable in magnitude to forecast returns will tend to diversify portfolios;
the effect of these costs on portfolio risk is, however, ambiguous, depending
on the degree of diversification required for cost reduction. The number of
assets in a portfolio invariably increases as a result of constraints, costs
and their combination.
  The implementation of cardinality constraints is essential for finding the
best-performing portfolio. The ability of the heuristic method to deal with
cardinality constraints is one of its most powerful features.

subject to rotation of the material axes, under a state of uniform stress. It
is shown that a stationary value of the strain energy requires the stress and

this well known coaxiality condition uses the 6-dimensional expression of the
rotation tensor for the elastic moduli. Using this representation it is shown
that the stationary condition is a minimum or a maximum if an explicit set of
conditions is satisfied. Specific results are given for materials of cubic,
transversely isotropic (TI) and tetragonal symmetries. In each case the
existence of a minimum or maximum depends on the sign of a single elastic
constant. The stationary (minimum or maximum) value of energy can always be
achieved for cubic materials. Typically, the optimal orientation of a solid
with cubic material symmetry is not aligned with the symmetry directions.
Expressions are given for the optimal orientation of TI and tetragonal
materials, and are in agreement with results of Rovati and Taliercio
\cite{Rovati03} obtained by a different procedure. A new concept is introduced,
the strain deviation angle, which defines the degree to which a state of stress
or strain is not optimal. The strain deviation angle is zero for coaxial stress
and strain. An approximate formula is given for the strain deviation angle

introduced an efficient lattice model in which the number of particles per site
is unrestricted. In numerical simulations this model displayed clean power
laws, indicating ordinary critical behavior associated with certain non-trivial
critical exponents. In the present work, however, we arrive at a different
conclusion. Increasing the numerical effort, we find a slow drift of the

collective composition fluctuations in dense polymer mixtures within
fluctuating-field approaches. The central idea of fluctuating-field theories is
to rewrite the partition function of the interacting multi-chain systems in
terms of integrals over auxiliary, often complex, fields, which are introduced
by means of appropriate Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Thermodynamic
averages like the average composition and the structure factor can be expressed
exactly as averages of these fields. We discuss different analytical and
numerical approaches to studying such a theory: The self-consistent field
approach solves the integrals over the fluctuating fields in saddle-point
approximation. Generalized random phase approximations allow to incorporate
Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle point. Field theoretical polymer
simulations are used to study the statistical mechanics of the full system with
Complex Langevin or Monte Carlo methods. Unfortunately, they are hampered by
the presence of a sign problem. In dense system, the latter can be avoided
without losing essential physics by invoking a saddle point approximation for
the complex field that couples to the total density. This leads to the external
potential theory. We investigate the conditions under which this approximation

with random positions and orientations within the wall. It is found that the

the number of embedded molecules is increased). Anchoring coefficients are
determined from fluctuations in the reciprocal space order tensor. It is found

The orbital elements of the representation are explicitly given in terms of the
conserved orbital energy, angular momentum and a quantity that characterizes
the leading order spin-orbit interactions in Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner-type
coordinates. Our parametric solution is applicable in the following two
distinct cases: (i) the binary consists of equal mass compact objects, having
two arbitrary spins, and (ii) the binary consists of compact objects of
arbitrary mass, where only one of them is spinning with an arbitrary spin. As
an application of our parametrization, we present gravitational wave
polarizations, whose amplitudes are restricted to the leading quadrupolar
order, suitable to describe gravitational radiation from spinning compact
binaries moving in eccentric orbits. The present parametrization will be
required to construct `ready to use' reference templates for gravitational
waves from spinning compact binaries in inspiralling eccentric orbits. Our
parametric solution for the post-Newtonian accurate conservative dynamics of
spinning compact binaries clearly indicates, for the cases considered, the
absence of chaos in these systems. Finally, we note that our parametrization
provides the first step in deriving a fully second post-Newtonian accurate
`timing formula', that may be useful for the radio observations of relativistic

$Br(B^-\to \pi^0a_0^-)$ since the predictions for a four quark model is one

string field theory (WSFT). In particular, special attention is paid to the
inter-particle zero-norm states in all quantization schemes. For the case of
the off-shell BRST zero-norm states, we impose the no ghost conditions and
recover exactly two types of on-shell zero-norm states in the OCFQ string
spectrum for the first few low-lying mass levels. We then show that off-shell
gauge transformations of WSFT are identical to the on-shell stringy gauge
symmetries generated by two types of zero-norm states in the generalized
massive sigma-model approach of string theory. The high energy limit of these
stringy gauge symmetries was recently used to calculate the proportionality
constants, conjectured by Gross, among high energy scattering amplitudes of
different string states. Based on these zero-norm state calculations, we have
thus related gauge symmetry of WSFT to the high-energy stringy symmetry of
Gross.

turns out that the Hubble entropy bound is satisfied with the entanglement

energy density which is the one saturating the Bekenstein-Hawking energy bound

Brownian paths started from the origin, whose genealogical structure is given
by the Continuum Random Tree (CRT). This Brownian tree may be generated from
the Brownian snake driven by a normalized Brownian excursion, and thus yields a
convenient representation of the so-called Integrated Super-Brownian Excursion
(ISE), which can be viewed as the uniform probability measure on the tree of
paths. We discuss different approaches that lead to the definition of the
Brownian tree conditioned to stay on the positive half-line. We also establish
a Verwaat-like theorem showing that this conditioned Brownian tree can be
obtained by re-rooting the unconditioned one at the vertex corresponding to the
minimal spatial position. In terms of ISE, this theorem yields the following
fact: Conditioning ISE to put no mass on $]-\infty,-\epsilon[$ and letting
$\epsilon$ go to 0 is equivalent to shifting the unconditioned ISE to the right
so that the left-most point of its support becomes the origin. We derive a
number of explicit estimates and formulas for our conditioned Brownian trees.
In particular, the probability that ISE puts no mass on $]-\infty,-\epsilon[$
is shown to behave like $2\epsilon^4/21$ when $\epsilon$ goes to 0. Finally,
for the conditioned Brownian tree with a fixed height $h$, we obtain a
decomposition involving a spine whose distribution is absolutely continuous
with respect to that of a nine-dimensional Bessel process on the time interval
$[0,h]$, and Poisson processes of subtrees originating from this spine.

observe the change in chemical concentrations. However, when the number of the

effects of fluctuations with the help of stochastic differential equations.
  Chemicals are composed of molecules on a microscopic level. In principle, the
number of molecules must be an integer, which must only change discretely.
However, in analysis using stochastic differential equations, the fluctuations
are regarded as continuous changes. This approximation can only be valid if
applied to fluctuations that involve a sufficiently large number of molecules.
In the case of extremely rare chemical species, the actual discreteness of the
molecules may critically affect the dynamics of the system.
  To elucidate the effects of the discreteness, we study an autocatalytic
system consisting of several interacting chemical species with a small number
of molecules through stochastic particle simulations. We found novel states,
which were characterized as an extinction of molecule species, due to the
discrete nature of the molecules. We also observed a strong dependence of the
