6.7, identified by the break at 1216 angstrom due to IGM absorption; two are
late type dwarf stars with red colors; and four are galaxies with colors and
spectral shape similar to dust reddened or old galaxies at redshifts z~1-2.
This constitutes the largest uniform, flux-limited sample of spectroscopically
confirmed galaxies at such faint fluxes z'<27.5.
  Many are also among the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxies (at
redshifts up to z=6.7).
  We find a significant overdensity of galaxies at redshifts z=5.9 +/- 0.2.
Nearly two thirds of the galaxies in our sample (15/23) belong to this peak.
Taking into account the selection function and the redshift sensitivity of the
survey, we get a conservative overdensity of at least a factor of two along the
line-of-sight. The galaxies found in this redshift peak are also localized in
the plane of the sky in a non-random manner, occupying about half of the ACS
chip. Thus the volume overdensity is a factor of four. The star-formation rate
derived from detected sources in this overdense region is sufficient to
reionize the local IGM.

dominated populations. Both models produce excellent fits to the counts in both

the longer Spitzer 24 micron band supporting the hypothesis that they are
luminous-ultraluminous infrared galaxies at z=2-3, being the mid-infrared
counterparts to the sub-mm galaxy population. The source counts are
characterized by strong evolution to redshift unity, followed by less drastic
evolution to higher redshift. The number-redshift distributions in both
wavebands are well explained by the effect of the many mid-infrared features
passing through the observation windows. The sharp upturn at around a
milliJansky in the 15 micron counts in particular depends critically on the

Specifically, we determine the amount of gas that will transit to a Toomre
unstable cold phase via the H2 cooling channel in the presence of a UV--X-ray
cosmic background radiation field.
  All but one of the models are predicted to become unstable to star formation.
Moreover, we find that all our model objects would be detectable via HI line
emission, even in the case that star formation is potentially avoided. These
results are consistent with the non-detection of isolated extragalactic HI
clouds with no optical counterpart (galaxies without stars) by HIPASS.
  Additionally, where star formation is predicted to occur, we determine the
minimum interstellar radiation field required to restore gravothermal
stability, which we then relate to a minimum global star formation rate. This
leads to the prediction of a previously undocumented relation between HI mass
and star formation rate that is observed for a wide variety of dwarf galaxies
in the HI mass range 10^8--10^10 M_sun. The existence of such a relation
strongly supports the notion that the well observed population of dwarf
galaxies represent the minimum rates of self-regulating star formation in the

source demonstrates the same variability pattern in all these bands. The broad
band power spectrum can be fitted by one power law down to frequencies ~1e-7 Hz
with flattening afterwards. Such a flattening means that on time scales longer
than ~1e7 sec the source variability becomes uncorrelated. This naturally leads
to the appearance of quasi-poissonian flares in the source light curve, which
have been regularly observed in radio and optical spectral bands. The radio
flux power spectrum appears to have a second break at Fourier frequencies ~1e-5
Hz which can be caused by the smearing of the intrinsic radio variability on
timescale of the light-crossing time of the radio emitting region. We find a
correlation of the radio and optical fluxes of SS433 and the radio flux is
delayed by about ~2 days with respect to the optical one. Power spectra of

Careful subtraction of host galaxy components in nuclear regions indicates that
the fractional variability (Delta F / F) of the nuclei is of order unity. At
least one of them is showing a compelling flaring activity within just a few
days, which appears to be quite different from previously known AGN
variability. We obtained spectroscopic data for the one showing the largest
flare and confirmed that it is in fact an AGN at z = 0.33 with an estimated
black hole mass of ~10^8 M_sun. As a possible interpretation, we suggest that
these activities are coming from the region around the black hole event
horizon, which is physically similar to the recently discovered near-infrared
flares of our Galactic nucleus. It is indicated that our Galaxy is not special,
and that surprisingly rapid flaring activity in optical/near-infrared bands may
be commonly hidden in nuclei of apparently normal galaxies with low Eddington
ratios, in contrast to the variability of well-studied luminous AGNs or

results consistent with those of Kirshner et al. (1989), but also revealed many
new emission lines. The most important are [Ne III] 3869, 3967 and Balmer lines

inconsistent: HST/FOS spectra indicate a significantly higher absolute flux and

two groups of absorption lines: the Lyman series and the CNO lithium-like
doublets. For the CNO doublets we assume that all three ions share the same
covering factors. The fitting method applied here overcomes some limitations of
the traditional method using individual doublet pairs; it allows for the
treatment of more complex, physically realistic scenarios for the
absorption-emission geometry and eliminates systematic errors that we show are
introduced by spectral noise. We derive velocity-dependent solutions based on
two models of geometrical covering -- a single covering factor for all
background emission sources, and separate covering factors for the continuum
and emission lines. Although both models give good statistical fits to the
observed absorption, we favor the model with two covering factors because: (a)
the best-fit covering factors for both emission sources are similar for the
independent Lyman series and CNO doublet fits; (b) the fits are consistent with
full coverage of the continuum source and partial coverage of the emission
lines by the absorbers, as expected from the relative sizes of the nuclear
emission components; and (c) it provides a natural explanation for variability
in the Ly$\alpha$ absorption detected in an earlier epoch. We also explore
physical and geometrical constraints on the outflow from these results.

radio scintillations from distant pulsars are best understood if the
interstellar electron-density fluctuations that cause the time broadening of
the radio pulses obey non-Gaussian statistics. In this picture the density
fluctuations are inferred to be strong on very small scales ($\sim 10^8-10^{10}
{cm}$). We argue that such density structures could correspond to the ionized
boundaries of molecular regions (clouds) and demonstrate that the power-law
distribution of scattering angles that is required to match the observations
arises naturally from the expected intersections of our line of sight with
randomly distributed, thin, approximately spherical ionized shells of this
type. We show that the observed change in the time-broadening behavior for
pulsar dispersion measures $\lesssim 30 {\rm pc} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ is consistent
with the expected effect of the general ISM turbulence, which should dominate
the scattering for nearby pulsars. We also point out that if the clouds are
ionized by nearby stars, then their boundaries may become turbulent on account
of an ionization front instability. This turbulence could be an alternative
cause of the inferred density structures. An additional effect that might
contribute to the strength of the small-scale fluctuations in this case is the
expected flattening of the turbulent density spectrum when the eddy sizes
approach the proton gyroscale.

presented in detail the data reduction and analysis of the individual galaxies.
For the unresolved X-ray sources we find the following: point sources are in
general located close to bright HII regions, rims of superbubbles, or young
stellar clusters. The number of X-ray point sources appears to be a function of
the current star formation rate and the blue luminosity of the hosts.
Ultraluminous X-ray sources are only found in those dwarf galaxies which are
currently interacting. The power law index of the combined cumulative X-ray
point source luminosity function is alpha=0.24+/-0.06, shallower than that of
more massive starburst galaxies (alpha=0.4-0.8) and of non-starburst galaxies
(alpha~1.2). For those galaxies showing extended X-ray emission (6 out of the 8
galaxies), we derive the following: Superwinds develop along the steepest
gradient of the HI distribution with volume densities of 0.02-0.06 cm^-3,
pressures of 1-3x10^5 K cm^-3, thermal energies of 2-30x10^54 erg, and hot gas
masses of 2-20x10^6 Mo (~1 per cent of the HI masses). The mechanical
luminosities of the developing superwinds are energetic enough to overcome the
gravitational potentials of their host galaxies. This scenario is supported by
the overpressures of the hot gas compared to the ambient ISM. Extended HI
envelopes such as tidal tails, however, may delay outflows on timescales
exceeding those of the cooling time of the hot gas.

opacities and diffusion treatment using these new abundances give poor
agreement with helioseismic inferences for sound speed profile, convection zone

results for evolved solar models with these reduced photospheric abundances,
trying varying diffusion treatments. We compare results for models with no

compared to a solar model evolved with the new abundances and standard physics,
none restores the good agreement with helioseismology attained using the
earlier abundances of, e.g., Grevesse & Sauval (1998). We suggest that opacity
increases of about 20% for conditions below the convection zone, or the
possibility of accretion of lower-Z material at the surface as the sun arrived
at the main sequence, should be investigated to restore agreement. In addition,
the new abundance determinations should be re-considered, as, if they are
correct, it will be difficult to reconcile solar models with helioseismic
results.

in IC 348, we discover periods in significant numbers of lower-mass stars (M <
0.25 Msun) and classical T-Tauri stars. This increased sensitivity to
periodicities is due to the enhanced depth and temporal density of our
observations, compared with previous studies. The period distribution is at
first glance similar to that seen in the Orion Nebula Cluster, with the
higher-mass stars (M > 0.25 Msun) showing a bi-modal period distribution
concentrated around periods of 2 and 8 days, and the lower-mass stars showing a
uni-modal distribution, heavily biassed towards fast rotators. Closer
inspection of the period distribution shows that the higher mass stars show a
significant dearth of fast rotators, compared to the Orion Nebula Cluster,
whilst the low mass stars are rotating significantly faster than those in
Orion. We find no correlation between rotation period and K-L colour or H-alpha
equivalent width.
  We also present a discussion of our own IC 348 data in the context of
previously published period distributions for the Orion Nebula Cluster, the
Orion Flanking Fields and NGC 2264. We find that the previously claimed
correlation between infrared excess and rotation period in the ONC might in
fact result from a correlation between infrared excess and mass. We also find a
marked difference in period distributions between NGC 2264 and IC 348, which
presents a serious challenge to the disc locking paradigm, given the similarity
in ages and disc fractions between the two clusters.

Horsehead nebula illuminated by the O9.5V star $\sigma$ Ori ($\chi \sim$ 60)
presents a typical photodissociation region (PDR) viewed nearly edge-on and
offers an ideal opportunity to study the gas density structure of a PDR. The
H$_2$ fluorescent emission observations reveal extremely sharp and bright
filaments associated with the illuminated edge of the nebula which spatially
coincides with the aromatic dust emission. Analysis of the H$_2$ fluorescent
emission, sensitive to both the far-UV radiation field and the gas density, in
conjunction with the aromatic dust and H$\alpha$ line emission, brings new
constraints on the illumination conditions and the gas density in the outer PDR
region. Furthermore, combination of this data with millimeter observations of
CO and dust continuum emission allows us to trace the penetration of the far-UV
radiation field into the cloud and probe the gas density structure throughout
the PDR. From comparison with PDR model calculations, we find that i) the gas
density follows a steep gradient at the cloud edge, with a scale length of 0.02
pc (or 10'') and $n_H\sim 10^4$ and $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the H$_2$ emitting and

0.8-2.5 um spectra with SpeX at the IRTF, which we classify as cluster members
with spectral types near M6, corresponding to masses of ~0.1 M_sun. Thus, no
probable substellar companions are detected in this survey. The frequencies of
stellar and substellar companions within 0.4-5"" (120-1600 AU) from low-mass
stars in IC 348 agree with measurements in the field. The factor of ~3-10
deficiency in brown dwarfs relative to stars among companions at wide
separations in IC 348 and across the much larger range of separations probed
for field stars is equal within the uncertainties to the deficiency in brown
dwarfs in measurements of mass functions of isolated objects. In other words,
when defined relative to stars, the brown dwarf ""desert"" among companions is
also present among isolated objects, which is expected if stellar and
substellar companions form in the same manner as their free-floating
counterparts. Meanwhile, among the 14 substellar primaries in our survey of IC
348, no companions are detected. This absence of wide binary brown dwarfs is
statistically consistent with the frequency of wide binary stars in IC 348.

record, with (a) a large amplitude (Delta B ~ 10 mag) and multi-maxima
photometric pattern, (b) a cool spectral type at maximum becoming cooler and
cooler with time during the descent, until it reached the never-seen-before
realm of L-type supergiants, never passing through optically thin or nebular
stages, (c) the development of a spectacular, monotonically expanding
light-echo in the circumstellar material, and (d) the identification of a
massive and young B3V companion, unaffected by the outburst. In this talk we
review the photometric and spectroscopic evolution during the first three full
years of outburst, the light-echo development and infer the nature of the
progenitor, which was brighter and hotter in quiescence than the B3V companion
and with an inferred ZAMS mass of about 65 Msun.

possible non-local interactions. But in dynamical mean field theory the
non-local interactions are ignored, and only the effects of the local

interactions is a basis dependent approximation. We propose a criterion to
construct an appropriate localized basis in which the truncation can be carried
out. This involves finding a basis in which a functional given by the sum of
the squares of the local interactions with appropriate weight factors is
maximized under unitary transformations of basis. We argue that such a
localized basis is suitable for the application of dynamical mean field theory
for calculating material properties from first principles. We propose an
algorithm which can be used for constructing the localized basis. We test our
criterion on a toy model and find it satisfactory.

crystallize in the so called T-prime-structure, i.e. without apical oxygen

been able to obtain the Mott-insulating ground state for small x before the

the amplitude of random-force correlations, thereby neglecting corrections of
the order of the molecular relaxation time to the inverse shear rate. The
analytic, non-perturbative, evaluation of the particle-phase total pressure,
which is calculated to be second order in the Stokes number (a dimensionless
measure of particle inertia), shows that the particle phase behaves as a
non-Newtonian fluid. The generalized Smoluchowski convective-diffusion equation
contains a shear-dependent cross derivative term and an additional term along
the streamwise direction, quadratic in the particle Stokes number. The
long-time diffusion coefficients associated with the particle flux relative to
the carrier flow are found to depend on particle inertia such that the
streamwise diffusion coefficient becomes negative with increasing Stokes
number, whereas one of the cross coefficients is always negative. The total

We argue that a mean-field theory for the Anderson localization transition must
be electron-hole symmetric and self-consistent at the two-particle (vertex)
level. We show that such a theory with local equations can be derived from the
asymptotic limit to high spatial dimensions. The weight of the diffusion pole,
i. e., the number of diffusive states at the Fermi energy, in this mean-field
theory decreases with the increasing disorder strength and vanishes in the
localized phase. Consequences of the disclosed behavior for our understanding
of vanishing of electron diffusion are discussed.

light-flavored hadrons (``heavy-to-light ratio'') in nucleus-nucleus collisions
tests the partonic mechanism expected to underlie jet quenching. Heavy-to-light
ratios are mainly sensitive to the mass and color-charge dependences of
medium-induced parton energy loss. Here, we assess the potential for
identifying these two effects in D and B meson production at RHIC and at the
LHC. To this end, we supplement the perturbative QCD factorized formalism for
leading hadron production with radiative parton energy loss. For D meson
spectra at high but experimentally accessible transverse momentum (10 < pT < 20
GeV) in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, we find that charm quarks behave
essentially like light quarks. However, since light-flavored hadron yields are
dominated by gluon parents, the heavy-to-light ratio of D mesons is a sensitive
probe of the color charge dependence of parton energy loss. In contrast, due to
the larger b quark mass, the medium modification of B mesons in the same
kinematical regime provides a sensitive test of the mass dependence of parton
energy loss. At RHIC energies, the strategies for identifying and disentangling
the color charge and mass dependence of parton energy loss are more involved
because of the smaller kinematical range accessible. We argue that at RHIC, the
kinematical regime best suited for such an analysis of D mesons is 7 < pT < 12
GeV, whereas the study of lower transverse momenta is further complicated due
to the known dominant contribution of additional, particle species dependent,
non-perturbative effects.

fields of the theory are associated to coordinates of enlarged superspaces. In
the context of $p$-branes, enlarged superspaces may be used to construct
manifestly supersymmetry-invariant Wess-Zumino terms and as a way of expressing
the Born-Infeld worldvolume fields of D-branes and the worldvolume M5-brane
two-form in terms of fields associated to the coordinates of these enlarged

superspace origin, as do the other worldvolume fields, and that they have a
composite structure. In $D$=11 supergravity theory enlarged superspaces arise
when its underlying gauge structure is investigated and, as a result, the
composite nature of the $A_3$ field is revealed: there is a full one-parametric
family of enlarged superspace groups that solve the problem of expressing $A_3$
in terms of spacetime fields associated to their coordinates. The corresponding
enlarged supersymmetry algebras turn out to be deformations of an {\it

forties, asks whether every distributive {&#8744;, 0}-semilatticeS is
isomorphic to the semilattice Conc L of compact congruences of a lattice L.
While this problem is still open, many partial solutions have been obtained,
positive and negative as well. The solution to CLP is known to be positive for
all S such that $|S|\leq\aleph\_1$. Furthermore, one can then take L with
permutable congruences. This contrasts with the case where $|S| \geq\aleph\_2$,
where there are counterexamples S for which L cannot be, for example,
sectionally complemented. We prove in this paper that the lattices of these
counterexamples cannot have permutable congruences as well. We also isolate
&#64257;nite, combinatorial analogues of these results. All the ""&#64257;nite""
statements that we obtain are amalgamation properties of the Conc functor. The
strongest known positive results, which originate in earlier work by the
&#64257;rst author, imply that many diagrams of semilattices indexed by the
square 2^2 can be lifted with respect to the Conc functor. We prove that the
latter results cannot be extended to the cube, 2^3. In particular, we give an
example of a cube diagram of &#64257;nite Boolean semilattices and semilattice
embeddings that cannot be lifted, with respect to the Conc functor, by lattices
with permutable congruences. We also extend many of our results to lattices
with almost permutable congruences, that is, $\ga\jj\gb=\ga\gb\uu\gb\ga$, for

zero, the isomorphism $Conc(A \otimes B)\cong Conc A \otimes Conc B$, holds,
provided that the tensor product satis&#64257;es a very natural condition (of
being capped) implying that $A\otimes B$ is a lattice. In general, $A \otimes
B$ is not a lattice; for instance, we proved that $M\_3\otimes F(3)$ is not a
lattice. In this paper, we introduce a new lattice construction, the box
product for arbitrary lattices. The tensor product construction for complete
lattices introduced by G. N. Raney in 1960 and by R. Wille in 1985 and the
tensor product construction of A. Fraser in 1978 for semilattices bear some
formal resemblance to the new construction. For lattices A and B, while their
tensor product $A\otimes B$ (as semilattices) is not always a lattice, the box
product, $A \bp B$, is always a lattice. Furthermore, the box product and some
of its ideals behave like an improved tensor product. For example, if A and B
are lattices with unit, then the isomorphism $Conc(A $\bp$ B) \cong Conc A
\otimes Conc B$ holds. There are analogous results for lattices A and B with
zero and for a bounded lattice A and an arbitrary lattice B. A join-semilattice
S with zero is called {0}-representable, if there exists a lattice L with zero

consequence: The tensor product of two {0}-representable semilattices is

property that $A \otimes B$ is a capped tensor product, for every lattice B

introduced in 1966 the concept of a sharply transferable lattice. In 1972, H.
Gaskill [5] de&#64257;ned, similarly, sharply transferable semilattices, and
characterized them by a very e&#64256;ective condition (T). We prove that a

join-semilattice. For a general lattice A with zero, we obtain the result: A is
amenable iff A is locally &#64257;nite and every &#64257;nite sublattice of A
is transferable as a join-semilattice. This yields, for example, that a

lattice D, de&#64257;ned as the lattice of all triples $(x, y, z) \in D^3$
satisfying $x \mm y = x \mm z = y \mm z$. The lattice M\_3[D] is a modular
congruence-preserving extension of D. In this paper, we investigate this
construction for an arbitrary lattice L. For every n > 0, we exhibit an
identity Un such that U1 is modularity and Un+1 is properly weaker than Un. Let
Mn denote the variety de&#64257;ned by Un, the variety of n-modular lattices.
If L is n-modular, then M\_3[L] is a lattice, in fact, a congruence-preserving
extension of L; we also prove that, in this case, $IdM\_3[L] \cong M\_3[Id L]$.
We provide an example of a lattice L such that M\_3[L] is not a lattice. This
example also provides a negative solution to a problem of R. W. Quackenbush: Is
the tensor product $A\otimes B$ of two lattices A and B with zero always a
lattice. We complement this result by generalizing the M\_3[L] construction to
an M\_4[L] construction. This yields, in particular, a bounded modular lattice
L such that $M\_4 \otimes L$ is not a lattice, thus providing a negative
solution to Quackenbush's problem in the variety M of modular lattices.
Finally, we sharpen a result of R. P. Dilworth: Every &#64257;nite distributive
lattice can be represented as the congruence lattice of a &#64257;nite
3-modular lattice. We do this by verifying that a construction of G.

monoid Dim L is commutative and conical, the latter meaning that the sum of any

a distance function. The maximal semilattice quotient of Dim L is isomorphic to
the semilattice Conc L of compact congruences of L; hence Dim L is a precursor
of the congruence lattice of L. Here are some additional features of this
construction: (1) Our dimension theory provides a generalization to all
lattices of the von Neumann dimension theory of continuous geometries. In
particular, if L is an irreducible continuous geometry, then Dim L is either
isomorphic to Z^+ or to R^+. (2) If L has no infinite bounded chains, then Dim
L embeds (as an ordered monoid) into a power of Z^+ $\cup$ {$\infty$}. (3) If L
is modular or if L has no infinite bounded chains, then Dim L is a refinement
monoid. (4) If L is a simple geometric lattice, then DimL is isomorphic to Z^+,
if L is modular, and to the two-element semilattice, otherwise. (5) If L is a
countably meet-continuous complemented modular lattice, then both Dim L and the
dimension function $\Dim$ satisfy (countable) completeness properties. If R is
a von Neumann regular ring and if L is the lattice of principal right ideals of
the matrix ring M\_2(R), then Dim L is isomorphic to the monoid V(R) of

transformations is an old and difficult problem. In this paper we show how to
construct large balls of full dimension in this space. To do this, we begin
with a marked discrete group of non-separating disjoint circle type. Such a
group determines three disjoint or tangent planes. We prove that there is a
whole family of discrete groups that share these planes.
  We find a set of six real numbers that serve as parameters for this family
and construct an embedding of our parameters into a classical representation of
the full space of free discrete groups. We see that each planar family fills
out a ball of full dimension in the classical embedding.

expectation value of any observable becomes diagonal in the eigenstates of the
total Hamiltonian for systems endowed with a continuous energy spectrum, and
(2), that this process can be interpreted as decoherence. We evaluate the first
claim in the context of a simple spin bath model. We find that even for large
environments, corresponding to an approximately continuous energy spectrum,
diagonalization of the expectation value of random observables does in general
not occur. We explain this result and conjecture that SID is likely to fail
also in other systems composed of discrete subsystems. Regarding the second
claim, we emphasize that SID does not describe a physically meaningful
decoherence process for individual measurements, but only involves destructive
interference that occurs collectively within an ensemble of presupposed
""values"" of measurements. This leads us to question the relevance of SID for
treating observed decoherence effects.

equation within the framework of special relativity. Young's and other
interference experiments are explained with a hypothesis that there is a
coupling interaction between the peaked and non-peaked pieces of the wave
packet. This explanation of the interference experiments provides a realistic
interpretation of quantum mechanics. The interpretation implies that there is
physical reality of particles and no wave function collapse. It also implies
that neither classical mechanics nor current quantum mechanics is a complete
theory for describing physical reality and the Bell inequalities are not the
proper touchstones for reality and locality. The problems of the boundary
between the macro-world and micro-world and the de-coherence in the transition
region (meso-world) between the two are discussed. The present interpretation
of quantum mechanics is consistent with the physical aspects of the Copenhagen
interpretation, such as, the superposition principle, Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle and Born's probability interpretation, but does not favor its
philosophical aspects, such as, non-reality, non-objectivity, non-causality and
the complementary principle.
