two-dimensional high-resolution (R = 50 000) spectra of the edge-on disk
objects HH30*, HK Tau B, and HV Tau C. For comparison purposes we also observed
with the same equipment both the classical T Tauri star HL Tau and the active
late-type star LDN 1551-9. The spectra of all three observed edge-on disks
consist of a T Tauri emission and absorption line spectrum with superimposed
jet emission lines. Analysis of the spectra confirmed that the disks are
completely opaque at visible wavelengths and that light from the central
objects reaches us only via scattering layers above and below the disk planes.
The central objects of our targets were found to be normal T Tauri stars
showing moderate but different amounts of veiling of their photospheric
spectra, indicating different accretion rates or evolutionary stages. We
suggest that all classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) show this observed morphology
when viewed edge-on. Part of the jet emission from edge-on systems is directly
visible to us in the forbidden lines as well as in Halpha and He I, a finding
which contradicts the present paradigm of a pure magnetospheric accretion
origin for the formation of hydrogen and helium emission lines in moderately
active CTTSs. From a comparison with those Taurus-Auriga CTTSs for which the
inclination is reliably known, we conclude that the view angle of CTTS systems
is one of the key parameters governing apparent Halpha emission strength in the
T Tauri class. We discuss the various possible formation regions for the Na I D
lines and show that profiles similar to observed ones can be formed at the base
of the disk wind.

correlations published by the SDSS collaboration. In particular we focus on the
evidence which has been recently presented for the scale and nature of the
transition to homogeneity in the galaxy distribution, and results which
describe the dependence of clustering on luminosity. The two questions are in
fact strictly entangled, as the stability of the measure of the amplitude of
the correlation function depends on the scale at which the mean density becomes
well defined. We note that the recent results which indicate the convergence to
well defined homogeneity in a volume equivalent to that of a sphere of radius
70 Mpc/h, place in doubt previous detections of ``luminosity bias'' from
measures of the amplitude of the correlation function. We emphasize that the
way to resolve these issues is to first use, in volume limited samples
corresponding to different ranges of luminosity, the unnormalized two point
statistics to establish the scale (and value) at which the mean density becomes
well defined. We note also that the recent SDSS results for these statistics
are in good agreement with those obtained by us through analyses of many
previous samples, confirming in particular that the galaxy distribution is well
described by a fractal dimension D ~ 2 up to a scale of at least 20 Mpc/h. We
discuss critically the agreement of this new data with current theoretical
models.

tidal tails indicative of a tidal disruption in a prograde orbit. In addition,
all (4/4) of the infrared luminous pairs (LIRGs) in the sample show long HI
tails, suggesting that the presence of a long HI tail can be a possible
signature of enhanced star formation activity in a collision of gas-rich
galaxies. More than half of the groups show a displacement of HI peaks from the
stellar disks. The CO(1-0) distribution is generally clumpy and widely

We probe the dark energy using two variants of its equation of state, and its
energy density.We consider a set of 13 cosmological and systematic parameters,
and assume reasonable priors on the lensing and supernova systematics. We
consider various lensing surveys: a wide survey with f_{sky}=0.7, and with 2
(WLT2) and 5 (WLT5) tomographic bins; a deep survey with 10 bins (WLT10). The
constraints found from Planck, 2000 supernovae with z_max=0.8, and WLT2 are:
{sigma(w_0)=0.086, sigma(w_1)=0.069}, {sigma(w_0)=0.088, sigma(w_a)=0.11}, and

{sigma(w_0)=0.033, sigma(w_a)=0.040}, and {sigma(E_1)=0.01, sigma(E_2)=0.04}.
Although some worries remain about other systematics, our study shows that
after the combination of the 3 probes, lensing tomography with many redshift
bins and large coverages of the sky has the potential to add key improvements
to the dark energy parameter constraints. However, the requirement for very
ambitious and sophisticated surveys in order to achieve some of the constraints

sheet in the equatorial plane. Closer inspection reveals a system of isolated
magnetic islands inside the sheet and ongoing magnetic reconnection. No regions
of negative hydrodynamic ''energy at infinity'' are seen inside the ergosphere

exact energy release mechanism(s) is(are) still unknown. Here, we investigate
in detail, the process of magnetic energy release in a situation where two
initially independent flux systems are forced into each other. Work done by the
foot point motions goes in to building a current sheet in which magnetic
reconnection takes place. The scaling relations of the energy input and output
are determined as functions of the driving velocity and the strength of fluxes
in the independent flux systems. In particular, it is found that the energy
injected into the system is proportional to the distance travelled not the rate
of travel. Similarly, the rate of Joule dissipation is related to the distance
travelled. Hence, rapidly driven foot points lead to bright, intense, but
short-lived events, whilst slowly driven foot points produce weaker, but
longer-lived brightenings. Integrated over the lifetime of the events both
would produce the same heating if all other factors were the same. A strong
overlying field has the affect of creating compact flux lobes from the sources.
These appear to lead to a more rapid injection of energy, as well as a more
rapid release of energy. Thus, the stronger the overlying field the more
compact and more intense the heating. This means observers must know the rate
of movement of the magnetic fragments involved in an events, as well as
determine the strength and orientation of the surrounding field to be able to
predict anything about the energy dissipated.

yield for DLAs about 0.25Z_sun, which is comparable to those for SMC and LMC.
And the predicted distribution is the same as that of observation at the
significant level higher than 60%. The predicted column density distribution of
modelled DLAs is compared with the observed ones with the corresponding number
density, gas content being discussed. We found that the predicted number
density n(z) at redshift 3 agree well with the observed value, but the gas
content \Omega_DLA is about 3 times larger than observed since our model
predicts more DLA systems with higher column density. It should be noted that
the predicted star formation rate density contributed by DLAs is consistent
with the most recent observations if the star formation timescale in DLAs is
assumed to be 1 to 3 Gyr. Meanwhile, the connection between DLAs and LBGs is
discussed by comparing their UV luminosity functions which shows that the DLAs
host galaxies are much fainter than LBGs. We also predict that only few percent
of DLAs can host LBGs which is also consistent with current observations.
However, there is a discrepancy between model prediction and observation in the
correlation between metallicity and HI column density for DLAs. We suggest that
this could result from either the inadequacy of Schmidt-type star formation law
at high redshift, the diversities of DLA populations, or the model limitations.

spectroscopy are used as inputs in deriving robust estimates of the reddening,
distance and nature of the progenitor of V838 Mon. The reddening is found to
obey the R_V=3.1 law and amounts to (i) E(B-V)=0.86 from the interstellar NaI

fitting the progenitor with theoretical isochrones of appropriate metallicity.
The distance is estimated from (a) the galactic kinematics of the three
components of the interstellar lines, (b) the amount of extinction vs the HI
column density and vs the dust emission through the whole Galaxy in that
direction, from (c) spectrophotometric parallax to the B3V companion, from (d)

isochrones with the components of the binary system in quiescence and found to
be around 10 kpc. Pre-outburst optical and IR energy distributions show that
the component erupting in 2002 was brighter and hotter than the B3V companion.
The best fit is obtained for a 50,000 K source, 0.5 mag brighter than the B3V
companion. Comparison with theoretical isochrones suggests an age of 4 million
year for the system and a mass around 65 M(sun) for the progenitor of the
outbursting component, which at the time of the outburst was approaching the
Carbon ignition stage in its core. The 2002 event is probably just a shell
thermonuclear event in the outer envelope of the star.

lone near-IR spectroscopy is able to recover stellar and wind parameters
derived in the optical. Most of the spectra have been taken with SUBARU IRCS,
at a resolution of 12,000, and with a very high S/N (200 or better). In order
to synthesize the strategic H/He lines, we have used our recent, line-blanketed
version of FASTWIND. First we investigated the predicted behaviour of the
strategic lines. In contradiction to what one expects from the optical in the
O-star regime, almost all photospheric H/HeI/HeII H/K band lines become
stronger if the gravity decreases. Concerning H and HeII, this finding is
related to the behaviour of Stark broadening as a function of electron density,
which in the line cores is different for members of lower (optical) and higher
(IR) series. Regarding HeI, the predicted behaviour is due to some subtle NLTE
effects resulting in a stronger overpopulation of the lower level when the
gravity decreases. For most of our objects, we obtained good fits, except for
the line cores of Br_gamma in early O-stars with significant mass-loss, where
this discrepancy might be an indirect effect of clumping. After having derived
the stellar and wind parameters from the IR, we have compared them to results
from previous optical analyses. Overall, the IR results coincide in most cases
with the optical ones within the typical errors usually quoted for the
corresponding parameters, i.e, an uncertainty in Teff of 5%, in log g of 0.1
dex and in Mdot of 0.2 dex, with lower errors at higher wind densities.

evidence that these few percent of ''extra'' spin states are coupled strongly

describing the collective dynamics in such systems with uniform time delays
near the bifurcation points. Here the theory is extended and applied to systems
with nonuniform time delays. For strong enough couplings the systems exhibit
delay-independent stationary states and delay-dependent oscillatory states. We
find that the regions of oscillatory states in the parameter space are reduced
with increasing width of the time delay distribution function; that is,
nonuniformity of the time delays increases the stability of the trivial
equilibrium. However, for symmetric distribution functions the properties of
the oscillatory states depend only on the mean time delay.

directly. The resulting coupled system is solved iteratively using the

charges in the membrane, we show that ions in an infinite length channel
interact via a one-dimensional (1D) Coulomb potential. The corresponding
electrostatic barrier $\Sigma$ is characterized by a ""geometric mean"" screening
$\Sigma \propto e^2 / \sqrt{\epsilon_w \epsilon_m}R$ ($R$ being the radius of
the pore, and $\epsilon_m \approx 2$ and $\epsilon_w \approx 80$ the room

exists a crossover length, $x_0 \propto R \sqrt{\epsilon_w / \epsilon_m} \sim
6.3 R$, below which the 1D potential governs the electrostatics and beyond
which the three-dimensional (3D) Coulomb potential screened by the membrane
takes over. Knowledge of this length enables us to discriminate between long
channels, the length $L$ of which satisfies: $L \gg 2 x_0$, and short channels
for which $L \ll 2 x_0$. The latter condition is satisfied by most realistic
channels ({\it e.g.}, gramicidin A where $R \approx 3 {\mathrm{\AA}}$, $L
\approx 2.5 {\mathrm{nm}}$ and $2x_0 \approx 3.8 {\mathrm{nm}}$) whose
translocation energy is therefore controlled by the part of the self-energy,
$\Sigma$, arising from the 1D potential. On this basis, we derive an expression
for $\Sigma$, with no fitting parameter, which applies to a generic
nano-channel of length $L$ and radius $R$.

spacetime geometry can be interpreted in terms of the fluctuations of these
motions. Thus one can give meaning to spacetime fluctuations in terms of
observables which describe the Brownian motion of test particles. We will first
discuss some electromagnetic analogies, where quantum fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field induce Brownian motion of test particles. We next discuss
several explicit examples of Brownian motion caused by a fluctuating
gravitational field. These examples include lightcone fluctuations, variations
in the flight times of photons through the fluctuating geometry, and
fluctuations in the expansion parameter given by a Langevin version of the
Raychaudhuri equation. The fluctuations in this parameter lead to variations in
the luminosity of sources. Other phenomena which can be linked to spacetime
fluctuations are spectral line broadening and angular blurring of distant
sources.

produced via quantum fluctuations during a de Sitter (dS) inflating phase of
our brane universe. In an effective 4-dimensional theory in which one
integrates out the extra-dimensional dependence in the action, KK gravitons are
equivalent to massive gravitons on the brane with masses $m>3H/2$, where $H$
represents the expansion rate of a dS brane. Thus production of even a tiny
amount of KK gravitons may eventually have a significant impact on the
late-time brane cosmology. As a first step to quantify the effect of KK
gravitons on the brane, we calculate the effective energy density and pressure
for a single KK mode. Surprisingly, we find that a KK mode behaves as cosmic
dust with a negative energy density on the brane. We note that the bulk energy

regularized pure-glue QCD path integral, the topological charge density
constructed from overlap Dirac operator organizes into an ordered space-time
structure. It was pointed out that, among other properties, this structure
exhibits two important features: it is low-dimensional and geometrically
global, i.e. consisting of connected sign-coherent regions with local
dimensions 1<= d < 4, and spreading over arbitrarily large space--time
distances. Here we show that the space-time structure that is responsible for
the origin of topological susceptibility indeed exhibits global behavior. In
particular, we show numerically that topological fluctuations are not saturated
by localized concentrations of most intense topological charge density. To the
contrary, the susceptibility saturates only after the space-time regions with
most intense fields are included, such that geometrically global structure is
already formed. We demonstrate this result both at the fundamental level (full
topological density) and at low energy (effective density). The drastic
mismatch between the point of fluctuation saturation (~ 50% of space-time at
low energy) and that of global structure formation (<4% of space-time at low
energy) indicates that the ordered space-time structure in topological charge
is inherently global and that topological charge fluctuations in QCD cannot be
understood in terms of individual localized pieces. Description in terms of
global brane-like objects should be sought instead.

occurrence of orientational moduli associated with the possibility of rotations
of their color fluxes inside a global SU(N) group. The bulk four-dimensional
theory has four supercharges; half-criticality of the non-Abelian strings would
imply then N=1 supersymmetry on the world sheet, i.e. two supercharges. In
fact, superalgebra of the reduced moduli space has four supercharges. Internal
dynamics of the orientational moduli are described by two-dimensional CP(N-1)
model on the string world sheet. We focus mainly on the SU(2) case, i.e. CP(1)
world-sheet theory. We show that non-Abelian BPS strings exist for all values
of mu_{1,2}. The low-energy theory of moduli is indeed CP(1), with four
supercharges, in a wide region of breaking parameters mu_{1,2}. Only in the
limit of very large mu_{1,2}, above some critical value, the N=2 world-sheet
supersymmetry breaks down to N=1. We observe ""supersymmetry emergence"" for the
flux-tube junction (confined monopole): the ""kink-monopole"" is half-critical
considered from the standpoint of the world-sheet CP(1) model (i.e. two
supercharges conserved), while in the bulk N=1 theory there is no monopole
central charge at all.

branches of the flux landscape. On one of these, if one requires small
cosmological constant, supersymmetry breaking is predominantly at the
fundamental scale; on another, the distribution is roughly flat on a
logarithmic scale; on the third, the preponderance of vacua are at very low
scale. A priori, as we will explain, one can say little about the first branch.
The vast majority of these states are not accessible even to crude, approximate
analysis. On the other two branches one can hope to do better. But as a result
of the lack of access to branch one, and our poor understanding of cosmology,
we can at best conjecture about whether string theory predicts low energy
supersymmetry or not. If we hypothesize that are on branch two or three,
distinctive predictions may be possible. We comment of the status of
naturalness within the landscape, deriving, for example, the statistics of the
first branch from simple effective field theory reasoning.

either exponential or power-law fall-off. Under the technical condition of
reflection positivity and for sufficiently spread out interactions, we prove
that the model exhibits a first-order phase transition whenever the associated
mean-field theory signals such a transition. As a consequence, e.g., in
dimensions $d\ge3$, we can finally provide examples of the 3-state Potts model
with spread-out, exponentially decaying interactions, which undergoes a
first-order phase transition as the temperature varies. Similar transitions are
established in dimensions $d=1,2$ for power-law decaying interactions and in
high dimensions for next-nearest neighbor couplings. In addition, we also
investigate the limit of infinitely spread-out interactions. Specifically, we
show that once the mean-field theory is in a unique ``state,'' then in any
sequence of translation-invariant Gibbs states various observables converge to
their mean-field values and the states themselves converge to a product
measure.

are obtained for quasilinear and Hessian equations of Lane-Emden type,
including the following two model problems: $ -\Delta_p u = u^q + \mu$ and
$F_k[-u] = u^q + \mu$, $u > 0$, on $R^n$, or on a bounded domain $\Omega$. Here
$\Delta_p$ is the p-Laplacian, and $F_k[u]$ is the $k$-Hessian defined as the
sum of $k\times k$ principal minors of the Hessian matrix $D^2 u$; $\mu$ is a
nonnegative measurable function (or measure) on $\Omega$.
  The solvability of these classes of equations in the renormalized (entropy)
or viscosity sense has been an open problem even for good data $\mu \in L^s
(\Omega)$, $s>1$. Such results are deduced from our existence criteria with the
sharp exponents $s = n(q-p+1)/pq$ for the first equation, and $s = n(q-k)/2kq$
for the second one. Furthermore, a complete characterization of removable
singularities is given.
  Our methods are based on systematic use of Wolff's potentials, dyadic models,
and nonlinear trace inequalities. We make use of recent advances in potential
theory and PDE due to Kilpelainen and Maly, Trudinger and Wang, and Labutin.
This enables us to treat singular solutions, nonlocal operators, and
distributed singularities, and develop the theory simultaneously for
quasilinear equations and equations of Monge-Ampere type.

introduced. We construct a classifying space for pairs as above with additional
""dualizing data"", with a forgetful map to the classifying space for pairs (also
constructed in the paper). On the first classifying space, we have an
involution which corresponds to passage to the dual pair, i.e. to each pair
with dualizing data exists a well defined dual pair (with dualizing data). We
show that a pair (E,h) can be lifted to a pair with dualizing data if an only
if h belongs to the second step of the Leray-Serre filtration of E (i.e. not
always), and that in general many different lifts exist, with topologically
different dual bundles. We establish several properties of the T-dual pairs. In

matrix elements as the FPD6 interaction, but all the T=0 two-body matrix
elements are set equal to zero (T0FPD6). Surprisingly, the T0FPD6 interaction
gives a semi-reasonable spectrum (or else this method would make no sense). A
consistent feature for even-even nuclei, e.g. {44,46,48}Ti and {48,50}Cr, is
that the reintroduction of T=0 matrix elements makes the spectrum look more
rotational than when the T=0 matrix elements are set equal to zero. A common

energies are too high for the full FPD6 interaction and too low for T0FPD6, as

number of pairs with an even angular momentum J, we find a new relationship
obtained by diagonalizing a unitary nine-j symbol. We are also able to get
results for the `no-interaction' case for T=0 states, for which it is found,
e.g., that there are less (J=1,T=0) pairs than on the average. Relative to this
`no-interaction case', we find for the most realistic interaction used that
there is an enhancement of pairs with angular momentum J=0,2,1 and 7, and a
depletion for the others. Also considered are interactions in which only the
(J=0,T=1) pair state is at lower energy, only the (J=1,T=0) pair state is
lowered and where both are equally lowered, as well as the QQ interaction. We
are also able to obtain simplified formulae for the number of J=0 pairs for the

"q-bio/0501034","Max Shpak","Max Shpak","Evolution of Variance in Offspring Number: the Effects of Population
  Size and Migration",,,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  It was shown by Gillespie (1974) that if two genotypes produce the same
average number of offspring on but have a different variance associated within
each generation, the genotype with a lower variance will have a higher
effective fitness. Specifically, the effective fitness is W(effective)=w-var/N,
where w is the mean fitness, var is the variance in offspring number, and N is
the total population size. The model also predicts that if a strategy has a
higher arithmetic mean fitness and a higher variance than the competitor, the
outcome of selection will depend on the population size (with larger population
sizes favoring the high variance, high mean genotype). This suggests that for
metapopulations with large numbers of (relatively) small demes, a strategy with
lower variance and lower mean may be favored if the migration rate is low while
higher migration rates (consistent with a larger effective population size)
favor the opposite strategy. Individual based simulation confirms that this is
indeed the case for an island model of migration, though the effect of
migration differs greatly depending on whether migration precedes or follows
selection. It is noted in the appendix that while Gillespie 1974 does seem to
be heuristically accurate, it is not clear that the definition of effective
fitness follows from his derivation.

relationship between school geometry and school biomass of various pelagic
fishes in various conditions, I here establish a scaling law for school
dimensions: the school diameter increases as a power-law function of school
biomass. The power-law exponent is extracted through the data collapse, and is
close to 3/5. This value of the exponent implies that the mean packing density
decreases as the school biomass increases, and the packing structure displays a
mass-fractal dimension of 5/3. By exploiting an analogy between school geometry
and polymer chain statistics, I examine the behavioral algorithm governing the
swollen conformation of large-sized schools of pelagics, and I explain the
value of the exponent.

Substantial rewrite based on referee reports","Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, 2006",,,"quant-ph",,"  We develop a notion of predicate transformer and, in particular, the weakest
precondition, appropriate for quantum computation. We show that there is a
Stone-type duality between the usual state-transformer semantics and the
weakest precondition semantics. Rather than trying to reduce quantum
computation to probabilistic programming we develop a notion that is directly
taken from concepts used in quantum computation. The proof that weakest
preconditions exist for completely positive maps follows immediately from the
Kraus representation theorem. As an example we give the semantics of Selinger's
language in terms of our weakest preconditions. We also cover some specific
situations and exhibit an interesting link with stabilizers.

Wigner of employing objects based on primitive concepts of physical theories is
discussed in some detail and the fact that histories are such objects is
emphasized. Application of histories formalism to the problem of understanding
the quasiclassical domain is treated in some detail. Other topics discussed
include generalized histories-based quantum mechanics and its application to
the quantum mechanics of space-time,generalization of the notion of time
sequences employing partial semigroups,quasitemporal structures, history
projection operator (HPO) formalism, the algebraic scheme of Isham and Linden,
an axiomatic scheme for quasitemporal histories-based theories and symmetries
and conservation laws in histories-based theories.

detection-loophole, as Larrson showed. We show that even when legitimate users
take into account non-detection events Eve can successfully eavesdrop if the
QKD system has been appropriately designed by the manufacturer. A loophole
utilized here is that of `free-choice' (or `real randomness'). Local QKD
devices with pseudo-random sequence generator installed in them can apparently
violate Bell's inequality.
