also insensitive to the 2-8 keV flux, being approximately constant around
Gamma~1 over more than two decades, strongly indicating that high X/O sources
represent the most obscured component of the XRB. For about half of the sample,
a redshift estimate (in most of the cases a photometric redshift) is available

rapid accretion of metal-poor gas is investigated with models using both
simplified and detailed nucleosynthesis recipes. The rapid decrease of the
oxygen abundance during infall is followed by a slower evolution which leads
back to the closed-box relation, thus forming a loop in the N/O-O/H diagram.
For large excursions from the closed-box relation, the mass of the infalling
material needs to be substantially larger than the gas remaining in the galaxy,
and the accretion rate should be larger than the star formation rate. We apply
this concept to the encounter of high velocity clouds with galaxies of various
masses, finding that the observed properties of these clouds are indeed able to
cause substantial effects not only in low mass galaxies, but also in the
partial volumes in large massive galaxies that would be affected by the
collision. Numerical models with detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions are
constructed. We assume star formation timescales and scaled yields that depend
on the galactic mass, and which are adjusted to reproduce the average relations
of gas fraction, oxygen abundance, and effective oxygen yield observed in
irregular and spiral galaxies. The resulting excursions in the N/O-O/H diagram
due to a single accretion event involving a high velocity cloud are found to be
appreciable, which could thus provide a contribution to the large scatter in
the N/O ratio found among irregular galaxies. Nonetheless, the N/O-O/H diagram
remains an important indicator for stellar nucleosynthesis.

mergers of disk galaxies with different mass ratios and orbital parameters,
published by Naab & Burkert. We use the spectral method by Carpintero & Aguilar
to determine the orbital content of every remnant and correlate it with its
intrinsic shape, and its projected kinematic and photometric properties. We
discuss the influence of the bulge component and varying pericenter distances.
The two most abundant orbit classes are the minor axis tubes and the box
orbits. Their ratio seems to determine the basic properties of a remnant. On
average, the fraction of minor axis tubes increases by a factor of two from a
merger mass ratio of 1:1 to 4:1, whereas the fraction of box orbits decreases
by 10%. At a given mass the central velocity dispersion of a remnant scales
with the ratio of minor axis tubes to box orbits. Interestingly, the division
line between rotational supported systems and pressure supported objects,
$(v_{maj}/\sigma_0)^*=0.7$, turns out to coincide with a box to minor axis tube
ratio of unity. The observed $h_3$-$v/\sigma$ anti-correlation for ellipticals
can not be reproduced by collisionless merger remnants. We propose that this
can only be reconciled by an additional physical process that significantly
reduces the box orbit content. Remnants which are dominated by minor axis tube
orbits have predominantly disky projections. Boxy remnants have always a box to
minor axis tube ratio larger than one. This study will enable to identify
observed ellipticals that could have formed, in the collisionless limit, by

gained a renewed interest after the discovery of the low power for the first
multipoles of the CMB by WMAP. To test the possibility that our space is a
multi-connected spherical space, it is necessary to know the eigenmodes of such
spaces. Excepted for lens and prism space, and in some extent for dodecahedral
space, this remains an open problem. Here we derive the eigenmodes of all
spherical spaces. For dodecahedral space, the demonstration is much shorter,
and the calculation method much simpler than before. We also apply to
tetrahedric, octahedric and icosahedric spaces. This completes the knowledge of
eigenmodes for spherical spaces, and opens the door to new observational tests
of cosmic topology.
  The vector space V^k of the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the
three-sphere S^3, corresponding to the same eigenvalue \lambda_k = -k (k+2),
has dimension (k+1)^2. We show that the Wigner functions provide a basis for
such space. Using the properties of the latter, we express the behavior of a
general function of V^k under an arbitrary rotation G of SO(4). This offers the
possibility to select those functions of V^k which remain invariant under G.
  Specifying G to be a generator of the holonomy group of a spherical space X,
we give the expression of the vector space V_X^k of the eigenfunctions of X. We
provide a method to calculate the eigenmodes up to arbitrary order. As an
illustration, we give the first modes for the spherical spaces mentioned.

these two absorbers, with the goal of distinguishing between the model of

DLAs arise in protogalactic fragments. We find some discrepancies with the

accord with the hierarchical picture. We use the properties of the rest-frame

are high-redshift DLA galaxies Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected by gas
cross section? The measured velocity dispersions of the DLA galaxies are in
agreement with this picture, while the data on the [OIII] luminosities and the

pressure at high densities introduces a cutoff in the linear power spectrum,
which may alleviate the dark matter substructure problem; we provide a

remain to reionize the universe, the equation of state today is nonrelativistic

nature of individual star-forming galaxies at different look-back times is
essential to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Deep redshift
surveys suggest star-formation activity increases by an order of magnitude from
z = 0 to ~1. As a direct test of whether substantial evolution in
star-formation activity has occurred, we need to measure the star formation
rate (SFR) density and the properties of the corresponding star-forming galaxy
populations at different redshifts, using similar techniques. The main goal of
this work is to extend the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) survey of
emission-line galaxies to higher redshifts. (continues)

the non-thermal component of the electron spectra observed by RHESSI during 24
solar hard X-ray flares. The quantitative evolution is confronted with the
predictions of simple electron acceleration models featuring the soft-hard-soft
behaviour. The comparison is general in scope and can be applied to different
acceleration models, provided that they make predictions for the behavior of
the spectral index as a function of the normalization. A simple stochastic
acceleration model yields plausible best-fit model parameters for about 77% of
the 141 events consisting of rise and decay phases of individual hard X-ray
peaks. However, it implies unphysically high electron acceleration rates and
total energies for the others. Other simple acceleration models such as
constant rate of accelerated electrons or constant input power have a similar
failure rate. The peaks inconsistent with the simple acceleration models have
smaller variations in the spectral index. The cases compatible with a simple
stochastic model require typically a few times 10^36 electrons accelerated per
second at a threshold energy of 18 keV in the rise phases and 24 keV in the
decay phases of the flare peaks.

ascertain whether the steepening of the temperature gradient is the main cause
of the transition, or merely a tracer of an underlying process.

polymer nanodroplets in a cylindrical geometry. The polymers, described by the
bead-spring model, spread on a flat surface with a surface-coupled Langevin
thermostat to mimic the effects of a corrugated surface. Each droplet consists
of chains of length 10 or 100 monomers with ~350,000 monomers total. The
qualitative features of the spreading dynamics are presented for differences in
chain length, surface interaction strength, and composition. When the
components of the droplet differ only in surface interaction strength, the more
strongly wetting component forms a monolayer film on the surface even when both
materials are above or below the wetting transition. In the case where the only
difference is the polymer chain length, the monolayer film beneath the droplet
is composed of an equal amount of short chain and long chain monomers even when
one component (the shorter chain length) is above the wetting transition and
the other is not. The fraction of short and long chains in the precursor foot
depends on whether or not both the short and long chains are in the wetting
regime. Diluting the concentration of the strongly wetting component in a
mixture with a weakly wetting component decreases the rate of diffusion of the
wetting material to the surface and limits the spreading rate of the precursor
foot, but the bulk spreading rate is not affected until the more strongly
wetting component is removed completely.

relaxation process due to the exchange interaction between conduction and

interatomic distance in the nanotube. As a result, the behavior of an electron
in a (n,1) nanotube subject to a transverse electric field is similar to that
in a semiconductor superlattice. In particular, Bragg scattering of electrons
from the long-range periodic potential results in the opening of gaps in the
energy spectrum of the nanotube. Modification of the bandstructure is shown to
be significant for experimentally attainable electric fields, which raises the
possibility of applying this effect to novel nanoelectronic devices.

there is a critical value $\ell_* = e^{-1}$ at which $\delta(\cdot)$ becomes
non-zero, and (presumably) a scaling exponent $\beta$ in the sense
$\delta(\ell) \asymp (\ell - \ell_*)^\beta$. Recently developed probabilistic

Solving numerically gives convincing evidence that $\beta = 3$. A parallel
study with trees instead of paths gives scaling exponent $\beta = 2$. The new
exponents coincide with those found in a different context (comparing optimal

where electrons are injected into the conduction band by photoexcitation, and
removed through the electron-hole recombination process at the bottom of the
conduction band. Here the kinetics of the electron-electron and the
electron-phonon (bath) scattering processes, as also the partitioning of the
total energy in the inelastic collisions, are duly parametrized by certain rate
constants. Our analytical results give the steady-state-energy distribution of
the classical (non-degenerate) electron gas as function of the phonon (bath)
temperature and the rates of injection (cw pump) and depletion (recombination).
Interestingly, we obtain an accumulation of the electrons at the bottom of the
conduction band in the form of a delta-function peak $-$ a non-equilibrium
classical analogue of condensation. Our model is specially appropriate to a
disordered, indirect band-gap, polar semiconducting sample where energy is the

of 1 billion documents in 2002. Most of the documents are Web pages whose data
is considered to be in XML format, expecting it to eventually replace HTML.
  A common problem in designing and maintaining a Web site is that data on a
Web page often replicates or derives from other data, the so-called base data,
that is usually not contained in the deriving or replicating page.
Consequently, replicas and derivations become inconsistent upon modifying base
data in a Web page or a relational database. For example, after assigning a
thesis to a student and modifying the Web page that describes it in detail, the
thesis is still incorrectly contained in the list of offered thesis, missing in
the list of ongoing thesis, and missing in the advisor's teaching record.
  The thesis presents a solution by proposing a combined approach that provides
for maintaining consistency of data in Web pages that (i) replicate data in
relational databases, or (ii) replicate or derive from data in Web pages. Upon
modifying base data, the modification is immediately pushed to affected Web
pages. There, maintenance is performed incrementally by only modifying the
affected part of the page instead of re-generating the whole page from scratch.

the momenta in the laboratory system of two experimentally observed particles A

resonance rather than nonresonant background or kinematic reflection. The
angular distribution of the relative momenta in the center-of-mass system
exhibits a forward-backward symmetry in the production and decay of any
resonance with a definite parity. This symmetry is not expected in other
nonresonant processes and can be expressed without needing angular
distributions in terms of the easily measured momenta in the laboratory frame
that are already measured and used to calculate the invariant mass of the
system. Our test is especially useful for low statistics experiments where the
full angular distribution cannot be determined. It can be applied to both
fixed-target and collider searches for the Theta^+ and Theta_c pentaquarks.

One of models to realize crossing the phantom divide is called quintom model,

other is a phantom-type scalar field. In this paper we propose a non-canonical
complex scalar field as the dark energy, which we dub ``hessence'', to
implement crossing the phantom divide, in a similar sense as the quintom dark
energy model. In the hessence model, the dark energy is described by a single
field with an internal degree of freedom rather than two independent real
scalar fields. However, the hessence is different from an ordinary complex
scalar field, we show that the hessence can avoid the difficulty of the Q-balls
formation which gives trouble to the spintessence model (An ordinary complex
scalar field acts as the dark energy). Furthermore, we find that, by choosing a
proper potential, the hessence could correspond to a Chaplygin gas at late
times.

of high-energy jets at mid-pseudo-rapidity in ultra-relativistic
nucleus--nucleus collisions at LHC and their potential for the characterization
of the partonic matter created in these collisions. In our approach, jets at
high energy with E_{T}>50 GeV are reconstructed with a cone jet finder, as
typically done for jet measurements in hadronic collisions. Within the ALICE
framework we study its capabilities of measuring high-energy jets and quantify
obtainable rates and the quality of reconstruction, both, in proton--proton and
in lead--lead collisions at LHC conditions. In particular, we address whether
modification of the jet fragmentation in the charged-particle sector can be
detected within the high particle-multiplicity environment of the central
lead--lead collisions. We comparatively treat these topics in view of an EMCAL
proposed to complete the central ALICE tracking detectors. The main activities
concerning the thesis are the following: a) Determination of the potential for
exclusive jet measurements in ALICE. b) Determination of jet rates that can be
acquired with the ALICE setup. c) Development of a parton-energy loss model. d)

studied, for the numerical solution a new approach is applied. With the usual
exponentially rising free-state asymptotical behavior, and also with a first
order correction to it, the lower half of the $k$ plane is systematically
explored. Note that no other method, including the complex rotation one, is
suitable for calculating virtual bound states far from the origin. Various
phenomena are studied about how the bound and the virtual bound states are
organized into a system. Even for short range potentials, the free state
asymptotical condition proves to be inadequate at some distance from the real
$k$ axis; the first order correction doesn't solve this problem.
  Therefore, the structure of the space spanned by the mathematically possible
solutions is studied and the notion of minimal solutions is introduced. Such
solutions provide the natural boundary condition for bound states, their
analytical continuation to the lower half plane does the same for resonances
and virtual bound states. The eigenvalues coincide with the poles of the
S-matrix. The possibility of continuation based on numerical data is also
demonstrated. The proposed scheme is suitable for the definition of the in- and
outgoing solutions for positive energies; therefore, also for the calculation
of the so called distorted S-matrix in case of long range interactions.

population undergoing mutation-selection dynamics in static, uncorrelated
random fitness landscapes. Starting from the population that consists of a
single genotype, the most populated genotype \textit{jumps} from a local
fitness maximum to another and eventually reaches the global maximum. We use a
strong selection limit, which reduces the dynamics beyond the first time step
to the competition between independent mutant subpopulations, to study the
dynamics of this model and of a simpler one-dimensional model which ignores the
geometry of the sequence space. We find that the fit genotypes that appear
along a trajectory are a subset of suitably defined fitness \textit{records},
and exploit several results from the record theory for non-identically
distributed random variables. The genotypes that contribute to the trajectory
are those records that are not \textit{bypassed} by superior records arising
further away from the initial population. Several conjectures concerning the
statistics of bypassing are extracted from numerical simulations. In
particular, for the one-dimensional model, we propose a simple relation between
the bypassing probability and the dynamic exponent which describes the scaling
of the typical evolution time with genome size. The latter can be determined
exactly in terms of the extremal properties of the fitness distribution.

entanglement fraction $F$ of the state (being an overlap between the shared
state and symmetric maximally entangled state) which can be obtained in single
copy distillation process. This implies that to get (probabilistically)
arbitrary good conclusive teleportation via mixed state at least one classical
bit of backward communication (for Bob to Alice) has to be sent. We provide
several other threshold properties in this context including in particular the
existence of ultimate threshold of optimal $F$ for states of full rank. Finally
the threshold results are linked to those of error correction. Namely it is
pointed out that in quantum computer working on fixed number of quantum bits
almost any kind of noise can be (probabilistically) corrected only to some
threshold error bar though there are some (rare) exceptions.

is the same efficiency as the distillation-based protocol

numerical studies. We find that, in general, presence of chaos in the system
produces more entanglement. However, coupling strength between two subsystems
is also very important parameter for the entanglement production. Here we show
how chaos can lead to large entanglement which is universal and describable by
random matrix theory (RMT). We also explain entanglement production in coupled
strongly chaotic systems by deriving a formula based on RMT. This formula is
valid for arbitrary coupling strengths, as well as for sufficiently long time.
Here we investigate also the effect of chaos on the entanglement production for
the mixed initial state. We find that many properties of the mixed state
entanglement production are qualitatively similar to the pure state
entanglement production. We however still lack an analytical understanding of
