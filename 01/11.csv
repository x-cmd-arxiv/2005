from massive stars trigger star formation, because there are numerous examples
of superbubbles showing secondary star formation at their edges. However, while
these systems show an age sequence, they do not provide strong evidence of a
causal relationship. The W3/W4 Galactic star-forming complex suggests a
three-generation hierarchy: the supergiant shell structures correspond to the
oldest generation; these triggered the formation of IC 1795 in W3, the
progenitor of a molecular superbubble; which in turn triggered the current
star-forming episodes in the embedded regions W3-North, W3-Main, and W3-OH. We
present UBV photometry and spectroscopic classifications for IC 1795, which
show an age of 3 - 5 Myr. This age is intermediate between the reported 6 - 20
Myr age of the supergiant shell system, and the extremely young ages (10^4 -
10^5 yr) for the embedded knots of ultracompact HII regions, W3-North, W3-Main,
and W3-OH. Thus, an age sequence is indeed confirmed for the entire W3/W4
hierarchical system. This therefore provides some of the first convincing
evidence that superbubble action and mechanical feedback are indeed a
triggering mechanism for star formation.

nebular model with hydrogen-deficient material embedded in diffuse gas of a
``normal'' chemical composition (i.e. $\sim$ solar), as the possible causes of
the dichotomy between the abundances that are deduced from collisionally

D71 (2005) 063531","10.1103/PhysRevD.71.063531",,"astro-ph",,"  [Abridged] The polarization of the CMB is widely recognized as a potential
source of information about primordial gravitational waves. The gravitational
wave contribution can be separated from the dominant CMB polarization created
by density perturbations because it generates both E and B polarization modes,
whereas the density perturbations create only E polarization. The limits of our
ability to measure gravitational waves are thus determined by statistical and
systematic errors, foregrounds, and nonlinear evolution effects such as lensing
of the CMB. Usually it is assumed that most foregrounds can be removed because
of their frequency dependence, however Thomson scattering of the CMB quadrupole
by electrons in the Galaxy or nearby structures shares the blackbody frequency
dependence of the CMB. If the optical depth from these nearby electrons is
anisotropic, the polarization generated can include B modes even without tensor
perturbations. We estimate this effect for the Galactic disk and nearby
extragalactic structures, and find that it contributes to the B polarization at
the level of ~(1--2)x10^-4\mu K per logarithmic interval in multipole L for
L<30. This is well below the detectability level even for a future CMB
polarization satellite. Depending on its structure and extent, the Galactic
corona may be a source of B-modes comparable to the residual large-scale
lensing B-mode after the latter has been cleaned using lensing reconstruction
techniques. For an extremely ambitious post-Planck CMB experiment, Thomson
scattering in the Galactic corona is thus a potential contaminant of the
gravitational wave signal; conversely, if the other foregrounds can be cleaned
out, such an experiment might be able to constrain models of the corona.

solar, can cause spurious shifts in the measured wavelengths and, therefore,
alpha. Here we explore chemical evolution models with enhanced populations of
intermediate-mass (IM) stars which, in their asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
phase, are thought to be the dominant factories for heavy Mg isotopes at the
low metallicities typical of quasar absorption systems. By design, these models
partially explain recent Keck/HIRES evidence for a smaller alpha in z_abs < 2

location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the

growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present

survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment
of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for
the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to
the construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the input
cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We are confident that the 2dFGRS
power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On
large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryon
oscillations' that are predicted in CDM models. Fitting to a CDM model,
assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrino
mass, the preferred parameters are $\Omega_{M} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and a
baryon fraction $\Omega_{b} /\Omega_{M} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).
The value of $\Omega_{M} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our
2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to
the signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements
in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a

galactic nuclei (AGN) in clusters and groups of galaxies. AGN outflows play a
crucial role in explaining the riddle of cooling flows and the entropy problem
in clusters. Here we study the effect of AGN on the intra-cluster medium in a
cosmological simulation using the adaptive mesh refinement FLASH code. We pay
particular attention to the effects of conductivity and viscosity on the
dissipation of weak shocks generated by the AGN activity in a realistic galaxy
cluster. Our 3D simulations demonstrate that both viscous and conductive
dissipation play an important role in distributing the mechanical energy
injected by the AGN, offsetting radiative cooling and injecting entropy to the
gas. These processes are important even when the transport coefficients are at
a level of 10% of the Spitzer value. Provided that both conductivity and
viscosity are suppressed by a comparable amount, conductive dissipation is
likely to dominate over viscous dissipation. Nevertheless, viscous effects may
still affect the dynamics of the gas and contribute a significant amount of
dissipation compared to radiative cooling. We also present synthetic Chandra
observations. We show that the simulated buoyant bubbles inflated by the AGN,
and weak shocks associated with them, are detectable with the Chandra
observatory.

include: Hubble flow at the Planck level, vacuum energy (no mass),
Evac/Emass=10^123 in agreement with quantum mechanics, and the pattern in the
CMB is the distribution of very early dark mass black holes of average mass
10^8 Msun. Excellent agreement with supernova Ia data is obtained with no

collisionless secular evolution because that would violate constraints on the
phase-space density: the phase-space density in bulges is several times larger
than in the inner parts of discs. We show that these arguments against secular
evolution are not correct. Observations give estimates of the coarsely grained
phase-space densities of galaxies, f'=rho_s/(sigma_R sigma_phi sigma_z), where
rho_s is stellar density and sigma_R, sigma_phi, sigma_z are the radial,
tangential, and vertical rms velocities of stars. Using high-resolution N-body
simulations, we study the evolution of f' in discs of Galaxy-size models.
During the secular evolution, the discs, which are embedded in live CDM haloes,
form a bar and then a thick, dynamically hot, central mass concentration. In
the course of evolution f' declines at all radii, not just in the central
region. However, the decline is different in different parts of the disc. In
the inner disc, f'(R) develops a valley with a minimum around the end of the
central mass concentration. The final result is that the values of f' in the
central regions are significantly larger than those in the inner disc. The
minimum, which gets deeper with time, seems to be due to a large phase mixing
produced by the outer bar. We find that the shape and the amplitude of f'(R)
for different simulations agree qualitatively with the observed f'(R) in our
Galaxy. Curiously enough, the fact that the coarsely grained phase-space
density of the bulge is significantly larger than the one of the inner disc
turns out to be an argument in favor of secular formation of bulges, not
against it.

spectroscopic follow-up undertaken at the Magellan telescope in order to
improve the completeness and depth of the sample. We present the data for the
individual groups, and find no clear trend in the fraction of passive galaxies
with group velocity dispersion and group concentration. We stack the galaxy
groups in order to compare the properties of group galaxies with those of field
galaxies at the same redshift. The groups contain a larger fraction of passive
galaxies than the field, this trend being particularly clear for galaxies
brighter than M_{B_J} < -20 in the higher velocity dispersion groups. In
addition, we see evidence for an excess of bright passive galaxies in the
groups relative to the field. In contrast, the luminosity functions of the star
forming galaxies in the groups and the field are consistent. These trends are
qualitatively consitent with the differences between group and field galaxies
seen in the local universe.

al., 2004). We find that the fraction of group galaxies with significant [OII]
emission (>=5\AA) increases strongly with redshift, from ~29% in 2dFGRS to ~58%
in CNOC2, for all galaxies brighter than ~ M*+1.75. This trend is parallel to
the evolution of field galaxies, where the equivalent fraction of emission line
galaxies increases from ~ 53% to ~ 75%. The fraction of emission-line galaxies
in groups is lower than in the field, across the full redshift range,
indicating that the history of star formation in groups is influenced by their
environment. We show that the evolution required to explain the data is
inconsistent with a quiescent model of galaxy evolution; instead, discrete
events in which galaxies cease forming stars (truncation events) are required.
We constrain the probability of truncation (P_trunc) and find that a high value
is required in a simple evolutionary scenario neglecting galaxy mergers
(P_trunc >~ 0.3 Gyr^{-1}). However, without assuming significant density
evolution, P_trunc is not required to be larger in groups than in the field,
suggesting that the environmental dependence of star formation was embedded at
redshifts z >~ 0.45.

surface brightness profile of the ICL out to 700 kpc, where it is less than
1/10,000 of the mean surface brightness of the dark night sky. The ICL appears
as a clear surface brightness excess with respect to an inner R^1/4 profile

the ICL ranges from 27.5 mag/arcsec^2 at 100 kpc to roughly 32 at 700 kpc in

light as a whole. The SB of the ICL correlates both with BCG luminosity and
with cluster richness, while the fraction of the total light in the ICL is
almost independent of these quantities. These results support the idea that the
ICL is produced by stripping and disruption of galaxies as they pass through
the central regions of clusters. Our measurements of the diffuse light also
constrain the faint-end slope of the cluster LF. Slopes alpha<-1.35 would imply
more light from undetected galaxies than is observed in the diffuse component.

variety of successful model compounds. We present a simple molecular theory
relating the self-organisation observed in these systems to their molecular
structure. The interactions are modelled by dividing each molecule into a
number of sub-molecular blocks to which specific interactions are assigned.
Three types of blocks are introduced, corresponding to fullerene units,
mesogenic units, and non-mesogenic linkage units. The blocks are constrained to
move on a rectangular 3-dimensional lattice and molecular flexibility is
allowed by retaining a number of representative conformations within the block
representation of the molecule. Calculations are presented for a variety of
molecular architectures including twin mesogenic branch mono-adducts of C60,
twin dendro-mesogenic branch mono-adducts and conical (badminton shuttlecock)
multi-adducts of C60. In spite of its many simplifications, the theory accounts
remarkably well for the phase behaviour of these systems.

function of the junction width result from the resonant amplification of the
Andreev process when the quasi-bound states enter the superconducting gap. For
SIFIS double-tunnel junctions spin split quasi-bound states partially amplify
the supercurrent and trigger the transitions between 0 and $\pi$ states of the
junction. Instead of the critical current reaching a peak value (which happens
when the Andreev states cross the Fermi surface in SINIS junctions), a narrow
dip opens up exactly at the peak due to the compensation of partial currents
flowing in opposite directions. This is related to the spin polarization of
Andreev states and explains the coexistence of stable and metastable 0 and
$\pi$ states in the vicinity of the transition. With increased barrier
transparency, the described mechanism of $0-\pi$ transitions is modified by the
broadening and overlapping of quasi-bound states (transmission resonances).
Temperature-induced transitions both from 0 to $\pi$ and from $\pi$ to 0 states
are studied by computing the phase diagram (temperature vs. junction width) for
different interfacial transparencies varying from metallic (transparent) to the

of Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). NEMS are nanoscale devices that
combine mechanical and electrical dynamics in a strong interplay. The shuttle
devices are a particular kind of Nanoelectromechanical systems. The
characteristic component that gives the name to these devices is an oscillating
quantum dot of nanometer size that transfers electrons one-by-one between a
source and a drain lead. The device represents the nano-scale analog of an
electromechanical bell in which a metallic ball placed between the plates of a
capacitor starts to oscillate when a high voltage is applied to the plates.
  This thesis contains the description and analysis of the dynamics of two
realizations of quantum shuttle devices. We describe the dynamics using the
Generalized Master Equation approach: a well-suited method to treat this kind
of open quantum systems. We also classify the operating modes in three
different regimes: the tunneling, the shuttling and the coexistence regime. The
characterization of these regimes is given in terms of three investigation
tools: Wigner distribution functions, current and current-noise. The essential
dynamics of these regimes is captured by three simplified models whose
derivation from the full description is possible due to the time scale
separation of the particular regime. We also obtain from these simplified
models a more intuitive picture of the variety of different dynamics exhibited
by the shuttle devices.

critical distribution of the power transmission coefficients, i.e.,
two-terminal conductances, P_c(G), with very high accuracy. The RG flow of P(G)
yields a value of the critical exponent nu that agrees with most accurate
large-size lattice simulations. A description of how to obtain other relevant
transport coefficients such as R_L and R_H is given. From the non-trivial fixed
point of the RG flow we extract the critical level-spacing distribution (LSD)
which is close, but distinctively different from the earlier large-scale
simulations. We find that the LSD obeys scaling behavior around the QH
transition with nu=2.37\pm 0.02. Away from the transition it changes towards
the Poisson distribution. We next investigate the plateau-to-insulator
transition. For a fully quantum coherent situation, we find a quantized Hall
insulator with R_H ~ h/e^2 up to R_L ~ 20 h/e^2 when interpreting the results
in terms of the most probable value of the distribution P(R_H). Upon further
increasing R_L, the Hall insulator with diverging R_H ~ R_L^kappa is seen. This
crossover depends on the precise nature of the averaging of P(R_L) and P(R_H).
We also study the effect of long-ranged inhomogeneities on the critical
properties of the QH transition modeled by a power law correlation in the
random potential. Similar to the classical percolation, we observe an
enhancement of nu with decreasing correlation range. These results exemplify
the surprising fact that a small RG unit, containing five nodes, accurately
captures most of the correlations responsible for the QH transition.

in one dimension using the density matrix renormalization group and include
on-site Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We examine parameters relevant
to manganites, treating the range of low to intermediate doping, 0<x<0.5. In
particular, we investigate whether quantum fluctuations favor phase separation
over the ferromagnetic polarons observed in a model with classical core spins.
We obtain very good agreement of the quantum model with previous results for
the classical model, finding separated polarons which are repulsive at short
distance for finite t_2g superexchange J'. Taking on-site Coulomb repulsion
into account, we observe phase separation for small but finite superexchange
J', while for larger J' polarons are favored in accordance with simple energy
considerations previously applied to classical spins. We discuss the
interpretation of compressibilities and present a phase diagram with respect to
doping and the t_2g superexchange parameter J' with and without Coulomb
repulsion.

buckets for the estimation of query result sizes. Several techniques (e.g.,
MaxDiff and V-Optimal) have been proposed in the past for determining bucket
boundaries which provide accurate estimations. However, while search strategies
for optimal bucket boundaries are rather sophisticated, no much attention has
been paid for estimating queries inside buckets and all of the above techniques
adopt naive methods for such an estimation. This paper focuses on the problem
of improving the estimation inside a bucket once its boundaries have been
fixed. The proposed technique is based on the addition, to each bucket, of
32-bit additional information (organized into a 4-level tree index), storing
approximate cumulative frequencies at 7 internal intervals of the bucket. Both
theoretical analysis and experimental results show that, among a number of
alternative ways to organize the additional information, the 4-level tree index
provides the best frequency estimation inside a bucket. The index is later
added to two well-known histograms, MaxDiff and V-Optimal, obtaining the
non-obvious result that despite the spatial cost of 4LT which reduces the
number of allowed buckets once the storage space has been fixed, the original
methods are strongly improved in terms of accuracy.

local radius of curvature of the external spacetime; this is assumed to be much
larger than M, the mass of the black hole. The metric is calculated up to a
remainder of order (r/R)^4, and it depends on a family of tidal gravitational
fields which characterize the hole's local environment. The coordinate system
allows an easy identification of the event horizon, and expressions are derived
for its surface gravity and the rates at which the tidal interaction transfers
mass and angular momentum to the black hole.

dark matter in the universe. ``Wrong'' statistics of neutrinos could modify big
bang nucleosynthesis, leading to the effective number of neutrino species
smaller than three. Dynamics of the supernova collapse would be influenced and
spectra of the supernova neutrinos may change. The presence of neutrino
condensate would enhance contributions of the Z-bursts to the flux of the UHE
cosmic rays and lead to substantial refraction effects for neutrinos from
remote sources. The Pauli principle violation for neutrinos can be tested in
the two-neutrino double beta decay.

analyze models where some of the matter fields are localized in the extra space

the QCD effective field theory it corresponds to a nonlinear soliton of the
pion field. Now we argue that the RHIC fireball is this soliton. We calculate
the soliton (black hole) temperature, and get $T=4a <m_{\pi}>/\pi$, with $a$ a
nonperturbative constant. For $a=1$, we get $175.76 MeV$, compared to the
experimental value of the fireball ``freeze-out'' of about $176 MeV$. The
observed $\eta/ s$ for the fireball is close to the dual value of $1/4\pi$. The
``Color Glass Condensate'' (CGC) state at the core of the fireball is the pion
field soliton, dual to the interior of the black hole. The main interaction
between particles in the CGC is a Coulomb potential, due to short range pion
exchange, dual to gravitational interaction inside the black hole, deconfining
quarks and gluons. Thus RHIC is in a certain sense a string theory testing
machine, analyzing the formation and decay of dual black holes, and giving

be viewed as the descendant $K_{10}$ of the Konishi multiplet in the 10 of
SU(4), carrying the anomalous dimension of the multiplet. Another descendant
$O_{10}$ with the same quantum numbers, but this time without anomalous
dimension, is obtained from the protected half-BPS operator $O_{20'}$ (the
stress-tensor multiplet). Both $K_{10}$ and $O_{10}$ are renormalized mixtures
of the same two bare operators, one trilinear (coming from the superpotential),
the other bilinear (the so-called ""quantum Konishi anomaly""). Only the operator
$K_{10}$ is allowed to appear in the right-hand side of the Konishi anomaly
equation, the protected one $O_{10}$ does not match the conformal properties of
the left-hand side. Thus, in a superconformal renormalization scheme the
separation into ""classical"" and ""quantum"" anomaly terms is not possible, and
the question whether the Konishi anomaly is one-loop exact is out of context.
The same treatment applies to the operators of the BMN family, for which no
analogy with the traditional axial anomaly exists. We illustrate our abstract
analysis of this mixing problem by an explicit calculation of the mixing matrix
at level g^4 (""two loops"") in the supersymmetric dimensional reduction scheme.

presence of smaller undetected events that are capable of triggering larger

that photons are created and annihilated in such processes. A Gedanken
experiment is considered in which kinetic energy from observed photons is
systematically removed until a limit of zero is reached. With the help of the
relativistic Doppler effect it is shown that even for infinitesimally small
kinetic energies the photons continue to exist, since in other inertial systems
they will be observed to have a much higher energy/frequency falling in an
easily detectable range. It is possible to formulate an alternative explanation
for absorption and emission processes on this basis in terms of real photons
with exactly zero kinetic energy being present before or after radiative
interactions. Bolstering this hypothesis is the fact that the statistical
mechanical treatment of photons interacting with oscillators in blackbody
radiation theory predicts an infinite density of photons of this energy, both
in the original Planck formulation employing Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and
in the subsequent Bose-Einstein description. These considerations demonstrate
that the E = 0 state is greatly preferred as the product of absorption because
of the requirement to have the interaction occur in a relatively narrow region
of space- time. There is thus strong evidence that photons are not created and
annihilated in radiative processes but simply have their kinetic energy changed
either to or from a zero value. Accordingly a very high density of zero-energy
photons is expected to exist uniformly throughout the universe. Finally, this
development suggests that one should subject the creation-annihilation
hypothesis to careful scrutiny in other areas of physics as well.

(Berry) phase when traversing adiabatically a closed cycle in parameter space.
We develop a general multidimensional theory of the geometric phase for
(double) cycles around exceptional degeneracies in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
We show that the geometric phase is exactly $\pi$ for symmetric complex
Hamiltonians of arbitrary dimension and for nonsymmetric non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians of dimension 2. For nonsymmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians of
higher dimension, the geometric phase tends to $\pi$ for small cycles and
changes as the cycle size and shape are varied. We find explicitly the leading
asymptotic term of this dependence, and describe it in terms of interaction of
different energy levels.

distinguishing hidden subgroup states. We show that the optimal measurement for
solving this problem is the so-called pretty good measurement. We then prove
that the success probability of this measurement exhibits a sharp threshold as
a function of the density nu=k/log N, where k is the number of copies of the
hidden subgroup state and 2N is the order of the dihedral group. In particular,
for nu<1 the optimal measurement (and hence any measurement) identifies the
hidden subgroup with a probability that is exponentially small in log N, while
for nu>1 the optimal measurement identifies the hidden subgroup with a
probability of order unity. Thus the dihedral group provides an example of a
group G for which Omega(log|G|) hidden subgroup states are necessary to solve
the hidden subgroup problem. We also consider the optimal measurement for
determining a single bit of the answer, and show that it exhibits the same
threshold. Finally, we consider implementing the optimal measurement by a
quantum circuit, and thereby establish further connections between the dihedral
hidden subgroup problem and average case subset sum problems. In particular, we
show that an efficient quantum algorithm for a restricted version of the
optimal measurement would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset
sum problem, and conversely, that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum
solutions allows one to implement the optimal measurement.

  We solve the Schr{\"" o}dinger equation of the model in the weak coupling

construct the controlled-controlled NOT gate in the case of n=3 by making use
of several resonance conditions and rotating wave approximation associated to

transformations. As a consequence, the resulting two-by-two density matrix
constitutes a representation of the Lorentz group. The associated Poincare
sphere is a geometric representation of the Lorentz group. Since the Lorentz
group preserves the determinant of the density matrix, it cannot accommodate
the decoherence process through the decaying off-diagonal elements of the
density matrix, which yields to an incerese in the value of the determinant. It
is noted that the O(3,2) deSitter group contains two Lorentz subgroups. The
change in the determinant in one Lorentz group can be compensated by the other.
It is thus possible to describe the decoherence process as a symmetry
transformation in the O(3,2) space. It is shown also that these two coupled
Lorentz groups can serve as a concrete example of Feynman's rest of the
universe.

Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real
and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the
Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes $H=H^\dagger$, where the symbol
$\dagger$ denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and
complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the
requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum
mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical
requirement of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry) without losing any
of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by
non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected
properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper
explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the
properties of some non-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum theories.

the sextic QES Hamiltonians in the literature because their eigenfunctions obey
PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian boundary conditions. These new Hamiltonians
present a novel problem that is not encountered when the Hamiltonian is
Hermitian: It is necessary to distinguish between the parametric region of
unbroken PT symmetry, in which all of the eigenvalues are real, and the region
of broken PT symmetry, in which some of the eigenvalues are complex. The
precise location of the boundary between these two regions is determined
numerically using extrapolation techniques and analytically using WKB analysis.
