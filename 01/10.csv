fluctuations. We present detailed calculations of these quantities utilizing
direct numerical approaches as well as error-controlled uniform approximations,
comparing with the (uncontrolled) traditional slow-roll approach. A simple
extension of the leading-order uniform approximation yields results for the
power spectra amplitudes, the spectral indices, and the running of spectral
indices, with accuracy of the order of 0.1% - approximately the same level at
which the transfer functions are known. Several representative examples are
used to demonstrate these results.

literature for radiation-driven dust ejection from galaxies as initial
conditions, and follow the motion onward. Via this mechanism, grains are
ejected into the IGM with velocities >100 km/s; as they move supersonically,
grains can be efficiently eroded by non-thermal sputtering. However, Coulomb
and collisional drag forces effectively reduce the charged grain velocity.
Up-to-date sputtering yields for graphite and silicate (olivine) grains have
been derived using the code TRIM, for which we provide analytic fits. After
training our method on a homogeneous density case, we analyze the grain motion
and sputtering in the IGM density field as derived from a LambdaCDM
cosmological simulation at z = 3.27. We found that only large (a >~ 0.1-um)
grains can travel up to considerable distances (few times 100 kpc physical)
before being stopped. Resulting metallicities show a well defined trend with
overdensity delta. The maximum metallicities are reached for 10<delta<100

16). However the distribution of sputtered metals is very inhomogeneous, with
only a small fraction of the IGM volume polluted by dust sputtering (filling
factors of 18 per cent for Si and 6 per cent for C). For the adopted size
distribution, grains are never completely destroyed; nevertheless, the
extinction and gas photo-electric heating effects due to this population of

self-consistent study of both optical and X-ray properties of elliptical
galaxies. Detailed cooling and heating processes in the interstellar medium are
taken into account using a mono-phase one-zone treatment which allows a more
reliable modelling of the galactic wind regime with respect to previous work.
The model successfully reproduces simultaneously the mass-metallicity,
colour-magnitude, the L_X - L_B and the L_X - T relations, as well as the
observed trend of the [Mg/Fe] ratio as a function of sigma, by adopting the
prescriptions of Pipino & Matteucci (2004) for the gas infall and star
formation timescales. We found that a late secondary accretion of gas from the
environment plays a fundamental role in driving the L_X - L_B and L_X - T
relations and can explain their large observational scatter. The iron
discrepancy, namely the too high predicted iron abundance in X-ray haloes of
ellipticals compared to observations, still persists. On the other hand, we
predict [O/Fe] in the ISM which is in good agreement with the most recent
observations. We suggest possible mechanisms acting on a galactic scale which
may solve the iron discrepancy. In particular, mixing of gas driven by AGNs may
preserve the gas mass (and thus the X-ray luminosity) while diluting the iron
abundance. New predictions for the amounts of iron, oxygen and energy ejected
into the intracluster medium (ICM) are presented and we conclude that Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) play a fundamental role in the ICM enrichment. SNe Ia
activity, in fact, may power a galactic wind lasting for a considerable amount
of the galactic lifetime, even in the case for which the efficiency of energy
transfer into the ISM per SN Ia event is less than unity.

criterion (\hat \mu<\hat \eta^2, with \hat \mu=\Omega_{out}/\Omega_{in} and
\hat \eta= R_{in}/R_{out}) now develop overstable axisymmetric Taylor vortices.
For the considered wide-gap container we find the nonaxisymmetric modes as the
most unstable ones. The nonaxisymmetric modes are unstable also beyond the
Rayleigh line. For such modes the instability condition seems simply to be
\hat\mu<1 as stressed by Yavneh, McWilliams & Molemaker (2001). However, we
never found unstable modes for too flat rotation laws fulfilling the condition
\hat \mu >\hat \eta. The Reynolds numbers rapidly grow to very high values if
this limit is approached (see Figs. 3 and 4).
  Also striking is that the marginal stability lines for the higher $m$ do less
and less enter the region beyond the Rayleigh line so that we might have to
consider the stratorotational instability as a 'low-$m$ instability'. The
applicability of these results to the stability problem of accretion disks with
their strong stratification and fast rotation is shortly discussed.

the signature resulting from the cooling of relativistic protons on an external

quite sensitive to internal metal mixing in supernovae (SNe). The extinction
curves predicted from the mixed SNe are dominated by SiO2 and is characterised
by steep rise from infrared to ultraviolet (UV). The dust from unmixed SNe
shows shallower extinction curve, because of the contribution from large-sized
(~ 0.1 um) Si grains. However, the progenitor mass is important in unmixed SNe
II: If the progenitor mass is smaller than ~ 20 Msun, the extinction curve is
flat in UV; otherwise, the extinction curve rises toward the short wavelength.

that incorporate the effect of feedback from ionising radiation. In our
simulations, the ionising source forms in the cluster core at the intersection
of several dense filaments of inflowing gas. We show that these filaments
collimate ionised outflows and suggest such an environmental origin for at
least some observed outflows in regions of massive star formation. Our
simulations show both positive feedback (i.e. promotion of star formation in
neutral gas compressed by expanding HII regions) and negative feedback (i.e.
suppression of the accretion flow in to the central regions). We show that the
volume filling factor of ionised gas is very different in our simulations than
would result from the case where the central source interacted with an
azimuthally smoothed gas density distribution. As expected, gas density is the
key parameter in determining whether clusters are unbound by photoionising
radiation. Nevertheless, we find - on account of the acceleration of a small
fraction of the gas to high velocities in the outflows - that the deposition in
the gas of an energy that exceeds the binding energy of the cluster is not a
sufficient criterion for unbinding the bulk of the cluster mass.

doped system it competes with the kinetic energy prop. to t. When a single hole
is doped to a half-filled chain, its motion is hindered and a localized orbital
polaron is formed. An increasing doping generates either separated polarons or
phase separation into hole-rich and hole-poor regions, and eventually polarizes
the orbitals and gives a it metallic phase with occupied 3z^2-r^2 orbitals.

by the structural relaxation process. A viscoelastic analysis of the

approached from the elastic side, we observe a decrease of the intensity of the
second, weakly dispersing feature, which completely disappears when the viscous
regime is reached. These findings unambiguously identify the second excitation
to be a signature of the transverse dynamics with a longitudinal symmetry

larger $q^2$ (corresponding to small recoil), which is the invariant mass
square of $l+\bar\nu$, whereas the perturbative QCD approach for smaller $q^2$
to calculate the form factors. The turning point where we require the form
factors derived in the two approaches to be connected, is chosen near
$\rho_{cut}=1.1$. It is noted that the kinematic parameter $\rho$ which is
usually adopted in the perturbative QCD approach, is in fact exactly the same
as the recoil factor $\omega=v\cdot v'$ used in HQET where $v$, $v'$ are the
four velocities of $\Lambda_b$ and $\Lambda_c$ respectively. We find that the
final result is not much sensitive to the choice, so that it is relatively
reliable. Moreover, we apply a proper numerical program within a small range
around $\rho_{cut}$ to make the connection sufficiently smooth and we
parameterize the form factor by fitting the curve gained in the hybrid scheme.
The expression and involved parameters can be compared with the ones gained by
fitting the experimental data. In this scheme the end-point singularities do
not appear at all. The calculated value is satisfactorily consistent with the
data which is recently measured by the DELPHI collaboration within two standard

level once supersymmetry is broken. Absence of color/charge breaking in this
model is related to doublet-triplet splitting in grand unified theory. An
extension of MSSM with a weak triplet shows very interesting results especially
when mu =0. It provides the most natural understanding of why we have only
electroweak symmetry breaking rather than having color/charge breaking. In the
limit mu=0, the model predicts very light chargino mass, 104 GeV while Higgs is
heavy, 130 GeV.

relaxes back to equilibrium. The relaxation of semiclassical black hole can be
described in terms of correlation function which exponentially decays with
time. In the momentum space it is represented by infinite set of complex poles
to be identified with the quasi-normal modes. This behavior is in sharp
contrast to the relaxation in unitary theory in finite volume: correlation
function of the perturbation in this case is quasi-periodic function of time
and, in general, is expected to show the Poincar\'e recurrences. In this paper
we demonstrate how restore unitarity in the BTZ black hole, the simplest
example of eternal black hole in finite volume. We start with reviewing the
relaxation in the semiclassical BTZ black hole and how this relaxation is
mirrored in the boundary conformal field theory as suggested by the AdS/CFT
correspondence. We analyze the sum over $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ images of the BTZ
space-time and suggest that it does not produce a quasi-periodic relaxation, as
one might have hoped, but results in correlation function which decays by power
law. We develop our earlier suggestion and consider a non-semiclassical
deformation of the BTZ space-time that has structure of wormhole connecting two
asymptotic regions semiclassically separated by horizon. The small deformation
parameter $\lambda$ is supposed to have non-perturbative origin to capture the
finite N behavior of the boundary theory. The discrete spectrum of perturbation
in the modified space-time is computed and is shown to determine the expected
unitary behavior: the corresponding time evolution is quasi-periodic with
hierarchy of large time scales $\ln 1/\lambda$ and $1/\lambda$ interpreted
respectively as the Heisenberg and Poincar\'e time scales in the system.

quotient bundle of the Grassmannian G(r,n). Separately but using similar
methods, we show that for r>=2, if Q denotes the universal quotient bundle of
the Grassmannian of r dimensional quotients G(r,n), n>=2r+1, then the class
[\psi^pQ] can never be equal to the class of a genuine vector bundle in K(G).
In parallel, we obtain a formula for the bid Chern classes in terms of the

Connes-Dixmier traces (introduced by Dixmier and adapted to non-commutative
geometry by Connes) on a general Marcinkiewicz space associated with an
arbitrary semifinite von Neumann algebra. By unifying various constructions,
and translating the situation of Dixmier traces into the theory of singular
symmetric functionals on Marcinkiewicz function/operator spaces, we obtain the
results (i) and (ii) below. The results are stated here, for the reader, in
terms of the ideal $L^{(1,\infty)}$ of compact operators whose partial sums of
singular values are of logarithmic divergence. (i) a positive compact operator
$x$ in $L^{(1,\infty)}$ yields the same value for an arbitrary Connes-Dixmier
trace (ie. $x$ is measurable in the sense of Connes) if and only if
$\lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{Log N}\sum_{n=1}^N s_n(x)$ exists, where $s_n(x)$
are the singular values of the compact operator $x$; (ii) the set of Dixmier
traces and the set of Connes-Dixmier traces are norming sets (up to
equivalence) for the space $L^{(1,\infty)}/L^{(1,\infty)}_0$, where the space
$L^{(1,\infty)}_0$ is the closure of all finite rank operators in the norm
$||.||_{(1,\infty)}$.

Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck ($RBUU$) transport equation including stochastic
effects. A Relativistic Mean Field ($RMF$) approach is used, based on a
non-linear Lagrangian, with coupling constants tuned to reproduce the high
density results of calculations with correlations.
  At variance with the case at Fermi energies, a new fast clusterization
mechanism is revealed in the early compression stage of the reaction dynamics.
Fragments appear directly produced from phase-space fluctuations due to
two-body correlations. In-medium effects of the elastic nucleon-nucleon cross
sections on the fragmentation dynamics are particularly discussed. The
subsequent evolution of the primordial clusters is treated using a simple
phenomenological phase space coalescence algorithm.
  The reliability of the approach, formation and recognition, is investigated
in detail by comparing fragment momentum space distributions {\it and
simultaneously} their yields with recent experimental data of the $FOPI$
collaboration by varying the system size of the colliding system, i.e. its
compressional energy (pressure, radial flow). We find an excellent agreement
between theory and experiment in almost all the cases and, on the other hand,
some limitations of the simple coalescence model. Furthermore, the temporal
evolution of the fragment structure is explored with a clear evidence of an
earlier formation of the heavier clusters, that will appear as interesting
$relics$ of the high density phase of the nuclear Equation of State ($EoS$).
