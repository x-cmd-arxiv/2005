of some controversy due to both data analysis issues and uncertainties with the
soft excess emission mechanism. XMM-Newton observations have finally laid to
rest any doubts as to the existence of the CSE and have also given tantalising
clues as to the nature of its emission mechanism. Here we report on the
analysis of XMM-Newton observations of a number of CSE clusters in an attempt
to improve the analysis and understanding of the CSE. Included as part of the
study is an analysis of the effects of background subtraction, which calls to
question the integrity of the claimed O VII line discovery, though not the soft

about Sgr A*, but also evidence for non-circular turbulent motion and a clumpy

physical conditions in the disk. We find that the molecular gas in the region
is both warm and dense, with T~200-300 K, n_H2~50,000-70,000 cm^-3. The mass of
warm molecular gas we measure in the central two parsecs is at least 2000
M_solar, about 20 times the UV-excited atomic gas mass, ruling out an UV
heating scenario for the molecular material. We compare the available spectral
tracers with theoretical models and conclude that molecular gas is heated with
magneto-hydrodynamic shocks with v~10-20 kms and B~0.3-0.5 mG. Using the
conditions derived with the CO analysis, we include the other important
coolants--neutral oxygen and molecular hydrogen--to estimate the total cooling
budget of the molecular material. We derive a mass to luminosity ratio of 2-3
M_solar/ L_solar, which is consistent with the total power dissipated via
turbulent decay in 0.1 pc cells with v_rms~15 kms. These size and velocity
scales are comparable to the observed clumping scale and the velocity
dispersion. At this rate, the material near Sgr A* its dissipating its orbital
energy on an orbital timescale, and cannot last for more than a few orbits. Our
conclusions support a scenario in which the features near Sgr A* such as the
CND and northern arm are generated by infalling clouds with low specific
angular momentum.

passage the relativistic electrons suffer severe inverse Compton losses by
upscattering the UV photons of the Be star at high energy : At periastron
passage Gamma-ray emission has been observed, whereas radio outbursts have
never been observed in 20 years of radio flux monitoring. For ejections
displaced from periastron passage the losses are less severe and radio
outbursts are observed. The radio emission mapped on scales from a few AU to
hundreds of AU shows a double-sided relativistic (beta=0.6c) S-shaped jet,
similar to the well-known precessing jet of SS433.

nearly massless, (Goldstone-like) pseudoscalar particle with $0< m_b <~
2.7\times 10^{-6}\eV$. One or both particles can be part of dark matter. There
are coherent long-range interactions (at range $\sim 1/m_b \simgt 10\cm$), from
exchange of a $b$ particle between a pair of $b$ particles, a pair of $\phi$
particles, and between a $\phi$ and a $b$. We compare the strength of
potentials for the different pairs to the corresponding gravitational
potentials (within the same range $\sim 1/m_b$), and show that the new force
dominates between a b pair, that gravitation dominates between a $\phi$ pair,
and that the potentials are comparable for a $\phi$-$b$ pair. The new
interaction strength between a $b$ pair is comparable to the gravitational
interaction between a $\phi$ pair; its possibly greater coherent effect
originates in the possibility that the number density of a very light $b$ can
be greater than that of a massive $\phi$. We consider these results in the
context of recent speculations concerning possible effects of special forces

of thermodynamics continues to be a source of confusion and controversy in
physics. This confusion has been accentuated by recent challenges to the second
law and by the difficulty in many cases of clarifying which formulation is
threatened and how serious the implications of a successful challenge would be.
To help bring clarity and consistency to the analysis of these challenges, the
aim of this paper is to suggest a simple formulation of the deep physics of the
second law, and to point out how such a statement might help us organize the
challenges by level of seriousness. We pursue the notion that the second law is
ultimately a restriction operating directly on the dynamics of information, so
the existence of this law can be traced to the need for a system of
""information bookkeeping"" that is independent of the bookkeeping for energy.
Energy and information are related but independent, so the dynamical
restrictions for one cannot be derived from those for the other. From this
perspective, we also suggest the possibility that the foundation of the second
law may be linked to the finite capacity of nature to store information about
its own state.

that oxygen incorporation into the sub-surface region starts at essentially the

the oxidation process of the surface. The mechanisms found to play a role

The electronic structure of the manganites are described with a double exchange

between the $Mn$ core spins. At zero temperature a variety of electronic phases
as ferromagnetic (FM) charge ordered (CO) orbital ordered (OO), CE-CO-OO and FM
metallic, are obtained. By raising the temperature the CE-CO-OO phase becomes
paramagnetic (PM), but depending on the electron-phonon coupling and the
exchange coupling the transition can be direct or trough intermediate states: a
FM disorder metallic, a PM-CO-OO or a FM-CO-OO. We also discus the nature of
the high temperature PM phase in the regime of finite electron phonon coupling.
In this regime half of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the $Mn$ ions are
distorted. In the weak coupling regime the octahedra are slightly deformed and
only trap a small amount of electronic charge, rendering the system metallic
consequentially. However in the strong coupling regime the octahedra are
strongly distorted, the charge is fully localized in polarons and the system is

simulation volume to large baths that are maintained at fixed concentrations
and voltages. The continuum baths are connected to the simulation through
interfaces, located in the baths sufficiently far from the channel. Average
boundary concentrations have to be maintained at their values in the baths by
injecting and removing particles at the interfaces. The particles injected into
the simulation volume represent a unidirectional diffusion flux, while the
outgoing particles represent the unidirectional flux in the opposite direction.
The classical diffusion equation defines net diffusion flux, but not
unidirectional fluxes. The stochastic formulation of classical diffusion in
terms of the Wiener process leads to a Wiener path integral, which can split
the net flux into unidirectional fluxes. These unidirectional fluxes are
infinite, though the net flux is finite and agrees with classical theory. We
find that the infinite unidirectional flux is an artifact caused by replacing
the Langevin dynamics with its Smoluchowski approximation, which is classical
diffusion. The Smoluchowski approximation fails on time scales shorter than the
relaxation time $1/\gamma$ of the Langevin equation. We find the unidirectional
flux (source strength) needed to maintain average boundary concentrations in a
manner consistent with the physics of Brownian particles. This unidirectional
flux is proportional to the concentration and inversely proportional to
$\sqrt{\Delta t}$ to leading order. We develop a BD simulation that maintains
fixed average boundary concentrations in a manner consistent with the actual
physics of the interface and without creating spurious boundary layers.

stable under small perturbations of the potential (e.g., potentials which are
close to that of almost Mathieu again give rise to almost 1/2 Holder continuous
IDS). Moreover, off a set of Hausdorff dimension zero the IDS is Lipschitz. We
further deduce from these properties that the IDS is absolutely continuous for
almost every shift angle. The proof is based on large deviation theorems for
the entries of the transfer matrices in combination with the avalanche
principle for non-unimodular matrices. These two are combined to yield a
multiscale approach to counting zeros of determinants which fall into small

of networks, the limit of the normalized cost agrees with the value function of
a differential game. The game's value is characterized in [2] as the unique
solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Partial Differential Equation (PDE). In
the current paper we apply this general theory to the important case of a
network of queues in tandem. Our main results are: (i) the construction of an
explicit solution to the corresponding PDE, and (ii) drawing out the
implications for optimal risk-sensitive and robust regulation of the network.
In particular, the following general principle can be extracted. To avoid
buffer overflow there is a natural competition between two tendencies. One may
choose to serve a particular queue, since that will help prevent its own buffer
from overflowing, or one may prefer to stop service, with the goal of
preventing overflow of buffers further down the line. The solution to the PDE
indicates the optimal choice between these two, specifying the parts of the
state space where each queue must be served (so as not to lose optimality), and
where it can idle.

been computed as a function of the particle momentum to nanotube curvature
radius ratio, $pv/R$. It is found that a bent MWNT can steer a particle beam
with bending capabilities similar to those of bent silicon crystal lattice and
to those of best (i.e. the narrowest) SWNT. In view of channeling applications
at particle accelerators, MWNT appear favored as compared to SWNT, because MWNT
can be produced quite straight (and in aligned array), while SWNT is typically

energy of lipid bilayers. Next, the entropy of a polymer confined in a curved

analysis. It is found that the free energy of cell membranes has the form of
the in-plane strain energy plus Helfrich's curvature energy. The equations to
describe equilibrium shapes and in-plane strains of cell membranes by osmotic
pressures are obtained by taking the first order variation of the total free

term induced by osmotic pressure. The stability of spherical cell membrane is
discussed and the critical pressure is found to be much larger than that of

cooperativity in the circuit components. While mechanisms of cooperativity have
been studied most extensively in the context of transcriptional initiation
control, cooperativity from other processes involved in the operation of the
circuits can also play important roles. In this study, we examine a simple
kinetic source of cooperativity stemming from the nonlinear degradation of
multimeric proteins. Ample experimental evidence suggests that protein subunits
can degrade less rapidly when associated in multimeric complexes, an effect we
refer to as cooperative stability. For dimeric transcription factors, this
effect leads to a concentration-dependence in the degradation rate because
monomers, which are predominant at low concentrations, will be more rapidly
degraded. Thus cooperative stability can effectively widen the accessible range
of protein levels in vivo. Through theoretical analysis of two exemplary
genetic circuits in bacteria, we show that such an increased range is important
for the robust operation of genetic circuits as well as their evolvability. Our
calculations demonstrate that a few-fold difference between the degradation
rate of monomers and dimers can already enhance the function of these circuits
substantially. These results suggest that cooperative stability needs to be
considered explicitly and characterized quantitatively in any systematic
experimental or theoretical study of gene circuits.

use it to perform some non-bilocal measurement over another bipartite system.
In particular, one can construct a specific game played by the observers
against a coordinator, in which they can score better than a pair of observers
who only share a classical communication channel.

Volume 94, Number 24, p. 240503",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.240503",,"quant-ph",,"  A scheme for optimal Gaussian cloning of optical coherent states is proposed
and experimentally demonstrated. Its optical realization is based entirely on
simple linear optical elements and homodyne detection. The optimality of the
presented scheme is only limited by detection inefficiencies. Experimentally we
achieved a cloning fidelity of about 65%, which almost touches the optimal
value of 2/3.

comprehensive description of corresponding geometric phase in which two
different points of view prevailing currently can be unified. Introducing an
ancillary system and considering the purification of given mixed state, we find
that different results of mixed state geometric phase correspond to different
choice of the representation of Hilbert space of the ancilla. Moreover we
demonstrate that in order to obtain Uhlmann's geometric phase it is not
necessary to resort to the unitary evolution of ancilla.
