uncorrelated redshift bins, and apply it to current and simulated type Ia
supernova data assuming spatial flatness. If the matter density parameter
Omega_m can be accurately measured from other data, then the dark energy
density history X(z)=rho_X(z)/rho_X(0) can trivially be derived from this
expansion history H(z). In contrast to customary ``black box'' parameter
fitting, our method is transparent and easy to interpret: the measurement of
H(z)^{-1} in a redshift bin is simply a linear combination of the measured
comoving distances for supernovae in that bin, making it obvious how systematic
errors propagate from input to output.
  We find the Riess et al. (2004) ``gold'' sample to be consistent with the
``vanilla'' concordance model where the dark energy is a cosmological constant.
We compare two mission concepts for the NASA/DOE Joint Dark Energy Mission
(JDEM), the Joint Efficient Dark-energy Investigation (JEDI), and the Supernova
Accelaration Probe (SNAP), using simulated data including the effect of weak
lensing (based on numerical simulations) and a systematic bias from
K-corrections. Estimating H(z) in seven uncorrelated redshift bins, we find
that both provide dramatic improvements over current data: JEDI can measure
H(z) to about 10% accuracy and SNAP to 30-40% accuracy.

accretion flow, if their broadening is indeed due to inner disk reflection.
Herein, we present two cases where the flux and equivalent width of the Fe
K-alpha emission lines in spectra of the Galactic black hole GRS 1915+105 vary
with the phase of strong 1 Hz and 2 Hz QPOs in the X-ray flux. These results
provide strong evidence that both QPOs and the Fe-alpha lines originate in the
inner disk. If the 1 Hz QPO is only a Keplerian orbital frequency, the QPO
comes from a distance of 84 +/- 26 R_Schw from the black hole; the 2 Hz QPO
implies a radius of 50 +/- 15 R_Schw. At these radii, relativistic shaping of a
disk line is inevitable. Moreover, the link holds in radio-bright and
radio-faint phases, signaling that in systems like GRS 1915+105, the Fe K-alpha
line is a disk line and not a jet line as per SS 433. A particularly
interesting possibility is that a stable warp in the inner disk, e.g. due to
Lense-Thirring precession, may produce the observed QPOs and line modulations.
More broadly, the FeK-QPO link provides an unprecedented mechanism for
revealing the inner accretion flow and relativistic regime in accreting
systems, in that it gives two measures of radius: for a given disk QPO model,
the frequency translates into a specific radius, and relativistic line models
yield radii directly.

temperature, either larger or smaller. In general the M-T and L-T relations

rulers. The recent discovery of a tight correlation between the collimation
corrected GRB energy and the peak of the gamma-ray spectrum has opened the
possibility to use GRBs as a new category of standard candles. Unfortunately,
because of the lack of low-z GRBs, up to now this correlation is obtained from
high-z GRBs with the consequence that it depends on the cosmological parameters
we pretend to constrain. Hopefully this circularity problem will be solved
when, in a few years, the low-z GRB sample will be increased enough. In the
meanwhile we present here a new Bayesian method that eases the aforesaid
circularity problem, and allows to introduce new constrains on the cosmological
(Om,OL) diagram as well as to explore the universe kinematics up to z~3. The
method we propose offers the further advantage to make handy the problem of the
(Om,OL) loitering line singularity which inevitably appears when standard
candles with z>2 are used. The combination of GRB with SN Ia data makes the
popular LambdaCDM cosmology more consistent with the Hubble diagram at a 68%
confidence level. For a flat cosmology we find Om=0.28\pm0.03 for the combined
GRB+SN Ia data set. Correspondingly, the transition redshift between cosmic
deceleration and acceleration is z_T=0.73\pm0.09, slightly larger than the

the accretion and disruption of dwarf galaxies, yet low-metallicity halo stars
are enriched in alpha-elements compared to similar, low-metallicity stars in
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We address this primary challenge for the
hierarchical formation scenario for the stellar halo by combining chemical
evolution modelling with cosmologically-motivated mass accretion histories for
the Milky Way dark halo and its satellites. We demonstrate that stellar halo
and dwarf galaxy abundance patterns can be explained naturally within the LCDM
framework. Our solution relies fundamentally on the LCDM model prediction that
the majority of the stars in the stellar halo were formed within a few
relatively massive, ~5 x 10^10 Msun, dwarf irregular (dIrr)-size dark matter
halos, which were accreted and destroyed ~10 Gyr in the past. These systems
necessarily have short-lived, rapid star formation histories, are enriched
primarily by Type II supernovae, and host stars with enhanced [a/Fe]
abundances. In contrast, dwarf spheroidal galaxies exist within low-mass dark
matter hosts of ~10^9 Msun, where supernovae winds are important in setting the
intermediate [a/Fe] ratios observed. Our model includes enrichment from Type Ia
and Type II supernovae as well as stellar winds, and includes a
physically-motivated supernovae feedback prescription calibrated to reproduce
the local dwarf galaxy stellar mass - metallicity relation. We use
representative examples of the type of dark matter halos we expect to host a
destroyed ``stellar halo progenitor'' dwarf, a surviving dIrr, and a surviving
dSph galaxy, and show that their derived abundance patterns, stellar masses,
and gas masses are consistent with those observed for each type of system.

baryons slow down significantly at postshock areas of gravitational strong
shocks, which can occur in high overdense as well as low overdense regions.
Consequently, the baryon fraction would be nonuniform on large scales. We
studied these phenomena with simulation samples produced by the WENO hybrid
cosmological hydrodynamic/N-body code. We find that the baryon fraction in high
mass density regions is lower on average than the cosmic baryon fraction, and
many baryons accumulate in the regions with moderate mass density to form a
high baryon fraction phase (HBFP). In dense regions with rho>100, which are the
possible hosts for galaxy clusters, the baryon fraction can be lower than the
cosmic baryon fraction by about 10%--20% at z ~ 0. Our simulation samples show
that about 3% of the cosmic baryon budget was hidden in the HBFP at redshift
z=3, while this percentage increases to about 14% at the present day. The gas
in the HBFP cannot be detected either by Ly-alpha forests of QSO absorption
spectra or by soft X-ray background. That is, the HBFP would be missed in the

Deep Field North (HDF-N) region. By excluding all sources with significant
detected X-ray emission in the 2 Ms Chandra observation we are able to examine
the properties of galaxies for which the emission in both UV and X-ray is
expected to be predominantly due to star formation. Stacking the X-ray flux
from 216 galaxies in the soft and hard bands produces significant detections.
The derived mean 2-10 keV rest-frame luminosity is 2.97+/-0.26x10^(40) erg/s,
corresponding to an X-ray derived star formation rate (SFR) of 6.0+/-0.6
Msolar/yr. Comparing the X-ray value with the mean UV derived SFR, uncorrected
for attenuation, we find that the average UV attenuation correction factor is
\~3. By binning the galaxy sample according to UV magnitude and colour,
correlations between UV and X-ray emission are also examined. We find a strong
positive correlation between X-ray emission and rest-frame UV emission. A
correlation between the ratio of X-ray-to-UV emission and UV colour is also
seen, such that L(X)/L(UV) increases for redder galaxies. Given that X-ray
emission offers a view of star formation regions that is relatively unaffected
by extinction, results such as these can be used to evaluate the effects of
dust on the UV emission from high-z galaxies. For instance we derive a
relationship for estimating UV attenuation corrections as a function of colour
excess. The observed relation is inconsistent with the Calzetti et al. (2000)
reddening law which over predicts the range in UV attenuation corrections by a
factor of ~100 for the UV selected z~1 galaxies in this sample (abridged).

show that the 2175 A feature is weak or absent. This can be the result of
radiative transfer effects (mixing the dust and stars) or due to dust grains
which do not have this feature. Spherical DIRTY radiative transfer models imply
that it is not radiative transfer effects, but other radiative transfer models
with disk/bulge geometries have found cases where it could be radiative
transfer effects. Recent work on the extinction curves in the Magellanic Clouds
and Milky Way has revealed that the traditional explanation of low metallicity
for the absence of the 2175 A feature in the Small Magellanic Cloud is likely
incorrect. The SMC has one sightline with a 2175 A feature and the Milky Way
has sightlines without this feature. In addition, where the 2175 A feature is
found to be weak or absent in both Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way, there
is evidence for recent star formation. Taking the sum of the radiative transfer
modeling of starburst galaxies and the behavior of Local Group extinction
curves, it is likely that the dust grains in starburst galaxies intrinsically
lack the 2175 A feature.

examination of phenomena like surface diffusion and thin film growth because of
its ability to carry out simulations for time scales that are relevant to
experiments. But the method generally has limited predictive power because of
its reliance on predetermined atomic events and their energetics as input. We
present a novel method, within the lattice gas model in which we combine
standard KMC with automatic generation of a table of microscopic events,
facilitated by a pattern recognition scheme. Each time the system encounters a
new configuration, the algorithm initiates a procedure for saddle point search
around a given energy minimum. Nontrivial paths are thus selected and the fully
characterized transition path is permanently recorded in a database for future
usage. The system thus automatically builds up all possible single and multiple
atom processes that it needs for a sustained simulation. Application of the
method to the examination of the diffusion of 2-dimensional adatom clusters on
Cu(111) displays the key role played by specific diffusion processes and also
reveals the presence of a number of multiple atom processes, whose importance
is found to decrease with increasing cluster size and decreasing surface
temperature. Similarly, the rate limiting steps in the coalescence of adatom
islands are determined. Results are compared with those from experiments where
available and with those from KMC simulations based on a fixed catalogue of

inverse temperature $\beta$. The guest charge is considered to be either an
infinite hard wall carrying a uniform surface charge or a charged colloidal
particle. The systems are treated as two-dimensional; the electrolyte is
modelled by a symmetric two-component plasma of point-like $\pm e$ charges with
logarithmic Coulomb interactions. Two cases are solved exactly: the
Debye-H\""uckel limit $\beta e^2\to 0$ and the Thirring free-fermion point
$\beta e^2 = 2$. The results at the free-fermion point can be summarized as
follows: (i) The induced electrostatic potential exhibits the asymptotic
behavior, at large distances from the guest charge, whose form is different
from that obtained in the Debye-H\""uckel (linear Poisson-Boltzmann) theory.
This means that the concept of renormalized charge, developed within the
nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory to describe the screening effect of the
electrolyte cloud, fails at the free-fermion point. (ii) In the limit of an
infinite bare charge, the induced electrostatic potential saturates at a finite
value in every point of the electrolyte region. This fact confirms the
previously proposed hypothesis of potential saturation.

that such violations are not limited to complex systems: simple systems may
also display this feature. Results from such systems are analytical and
obviously easier to understand than those obtained in complex structures, where

In this regime, the effective action is intimately connected with that in

LLL anomaly). On the other hand, it is shown that although a contribution of
each of an infinite number of higher Landau levels is suppressed in an infrared

leads to a restoration of the original U(1) gauge symmetry in the infrared

the cosmological constant that leaves a clear footprint, through a
characteristic, constant emission rate of ultrasoft quanta determined by the

correspond to a higher dimension. We are not yet perfectly successful. In

states that the bilinear space $(Z,F)$ can be decomposed into an orthogonal sum
of hyperbolic planes, singular, and anisotropic components. We prove the
existence of such a decomposition of small height, where all bounds on height
are explicit in terms of heights of $F$ and $Z$. We also prove a special
version of Siegel's Lemma for a bilinear space, which provides a small-height
orthogonal decomposition into one-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we prove an
effective version of Cartan-Dieudonn{\'e} theorem. Namely, we show that every
isometry $\sigma$ of a regular bilinear space $(Z,F)$ can be represented as a
product of reflections of small heights with an explicit bound on heights in
terms of heights of $F$, $Z$, and $\sigma$.

formalism of generating probability functions to calculate exactly the average
difference between the magnitude of a mainshock and the magnitude of its
largest aftershock over all generations. This average magnitude difference is
found empirically to be independent of the mainshock magnitude and equal to
1.2, a universal behavior known as Bath's law. Our theory shows that Bath's law
holds only sufficiently close to the critical regime of the ETAS branching
process. Allowing for error bars +- 0.1 for Bath's constant value around 1.2,
our exact analytical treatment of Bath's law provides new constraints on the
productivity exponent alpha and the branching ratio n: $0.9 <= alpha <= 1$ and
0.8 <= n <= 1. We propose a novel method for measuring alpha based on the
predicted renormalization of the Gutenberg-Richter distribution of the
magnitudes of the largest aftershock. We also introduce the ``second Bath's law
for foreshocks: the probability that a main earthquake turns out to be the
foreshock does not depend on its magnitude.

  2000",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  Small ions are part of the atmospheric aerosol spectrum, and study of
ion-aerosol interactions is fundamental in atmospheric physics. Air ion physics
and instrumentation are reviewed, including the historical context. A
miniaturised Gerdien condenser for ion measurement, operating in situ to
minimise inlet errors, is described. Two operating modes using independent
current and voltage decay measurements are employed. A more sophisticated
self-calibrating and fully programmable ion mobility spectrometer (PIMS) based
on the same principles, is also discussed. Detailed analysis of error terms and
application of new technology is demonstrated to greatly improve its
capability. Self-consistent experimental approaches, including ionisation and
ion concentration instruments, are used for calibration. In developing and
characterising the individual components of the PIMS, favourable and
unfavourable operating regimes are identified: this approach can also be
applied to other aspiration ion counting techniques. Use of a sophisticated
programmable electrometer permits compensation for leakage terms.
Electrically-charged aerosol particles have been found to complicate the ion
measurements. Consequently, conventional ion-aerosol theory, which neglects the
particulate concentration, is thought to be incomplete. The polymodal ion
mobility spectrum is also found to influence the instrument's operation.
Development of the novel programmable ion instrumentation, in conjunction with
consideration of the ion mobility spectrum yields an improved and flexible
approach to in situ atmospheric ion measurements.

synapses from the CA3 Shaffer collateral pathway onto CA1 pyramidal cells in
the hippocampus suggest that the transitions in synaptic strength occur among
discrete levels at individual synapses (~\cite{Peter} and S. S.-H. Wang,
unpublished data used with the authors' permission). This happens for both long
term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) induction protocols.
O'Connor, Wittenberg, and Wang have argued that three states would account for
their observations on individual synapses in the CA3-CA1 pathway. We develop a
quantitative model of this three state system with transitions among the states
determined by a competition between kinases and phosphatases shown by O'Connor
et al. to be determinant of LTP and LTD, respectively. Specific predictions for
various plasticity protocols are given by coupling this description of discrete
synaptic AMPA conductance changes to a model of postsynaptic membrane potential
and associated intracellular calcium fluxes to yield the transition rates among
the states. We then present various LTP and LTD induction protocols to the
model system and report the resulting whole cell changes in AMPA conductance.
We also examine the effect of our discrete state synaptic plasticity model on
the synchronization of realistic oscillating neurons. We show that one-to-one
synchronization is enhanced by the plasticity we discuss here and the
presynaptic and postsynaptic oscillations are in phase. Synaptic strength
saturates naturally in this model and does not require artificial upper or
lower cutoffs, in contrast to earlier models of plasticity.
