profiles regardless of whether they form in hierarchical cosmologies or via
spherical collapse. Likewise, the shape parameters of haloes formed
hierarchically do not seem to depend on the epoch in which the last major
merger took place. Both findings suggest that the density profile of haloes
does not depend on their aggregation history. Yet, this possibility is
apparently at odds with some correlations involving the scale radius r_s found
in numerical simulations. Here we prove that the scale radius of relaxed,
non-rotating, spherically symmetric haloes endowed with the universal density
profile is determined exclusively by the current values of four independent,
though correlated, quantities: mass, energy and their respective instantaneous
accretion rates. Under this premise and taking into account the inside-out
growth of haloes during the accretion phase between major mergers, we build a
simple physical model for the evolution of r_s along the main branch of halo
merger trees that reproduces all the empirical trends shown by this parameter
in N-body simulations. This confirms the conclusion that the empirical
correlations involving r_s do not actually imply the dependence of this
parameter on the halo aggregation history. The present results give strong
support to the explanation put forward in a recent paper by Manrique et al.
(2003) for the origin of the halo universal density profile.

homogeneous sample of intermediate signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optical spectra
of galaxies and quasars. The fully automated SDSS spectroscopic reduction
pipeline has provided spectra of unprecedented quality that cover the
wavelength range 3800-9200A. However, in common with spectra from virtually all
multi-object surveys employing fibres, there remain significant systematic
residuals in many of the spectra due to the incomplete subtraction of the
strong OH sky emission lines longward of 6700A. The S/N over substantial
wavelength regions in many spectra is reduced by more than a factor of 2 over
that expected from counting statistics. We present a method to automatically
remove the sky residual signal, using a principal component analysis (PCA)
which takes advantage of the correlation in the form of the sky subtraction
residuals present in each spectrum. Application of the method results in
spectra with essentially no evidence for degradation due to the incomplete
subtraction of OH emission features. A dramatic improvement in the quality of a
substantial number of spectra, particularly those of faint objects such as the
bulk of the high-redshift quasars, is achieved. We make available IDL code and
documentation to implement the sky residual subtraction scheme on SDSS spectra
included in the public data releases. We illustrate the power of the
sky-residual subtraction scheme using samples of SDSS galaxy and quasar
spectra, presenting tests involving the near-infrared CaII triplet absorption,
metal absorption line features in damped Lyman-alpha systems and composite

uncertainties in excess variance which accounts both for measurement
uncertainties and for the stochastic nature of the variability. We also present
an analytical method to predict the excess variance from a model power spectrum
accounting for binning, sampling and windowing effects. Using this, we modelled
the variance-mass relation assuming all objects have a universal twice-broken
power spectrum, with the position of the breaks being dependent on mass. This
accounts for the general form of the relationship but there is considerable
scatter. We investigated this scatter as a function of the X-ray photon index,
luminosity and Eddington ratio. After accounting for the dependence of excess
variance on mass, we find no significant correlation with either luminosity or
X-ray spectral slope. We do find an anti-correlation between excess variance

through the photosphere indicates that it exists as isolated flux tubes in the
convection zone, and will remain as discrete flux tubes in the corona until it
collides and reconnects with other coronal fields. Collisions of these flux
tubes will in general be three dimensional, and will often lead to
reconnection, both rearranging the magnetic field topology in fundamental ways,
and releasing magnetic energy. With the goal of better understanding these
dynamics, we carry out a set of numerical experiments exploring fundamental
characteristics of three dimensional magnetic flux tube reconnection. We first
show that reconnecting flux tubes at opposite extremes of twist behave very
differently: in some configurations, low twist tubes slingshot while high twist
tubes tunnel. We then discuss a theory explaining these differences: by
assuming helicity conservation during the reconnection one can show that at
high twist, tunneled tubes reach a lower magnetic energy state than slingshot
tubes, whereas at low twist the opposite holds. We test three predictions made
by this theory. 1) We find that the level of twist at which the transition from
slingshot to tunnel occurs is about two to three times higher than predicted on
the basis of energetics and helicity conservation alone, probably because the
dynamics of the reconnection play a large role as well. 2) We find that the
tunnel occurs at all flux tube collision angles predicted by the theory. 3) We
find that the amount of magnetic energy a slingshot or a tunnel reconnection
releases agrees reasonably well with the theory, though at the high
resistivities we have to use for numerical stability, a significant amount of
magnetic energy is lost to diffusion, independent of reconnection.

Considerably more hydrogen may be in ionized form, since the abundances of C

to their respective solar abundance ratios. Our determination [O/H] = -0.19 in
the H I-bearing gas indicates that the chemical enrichment of the gas is
unusually high for an extragalactic QSO absorption system. However, this same
material has an unusually low abundance of nitrogen, [N/O] < -0.59, indicating
that there may not have been enough time during this enrichment for secondary
nitrogen to arise from low and intermediate mass stars. In an earlier
investigation we found two galaxies at nearly the same redshift as this
absorption system and displaced by 34 and 87 kpc from the line of sight. An
r-band image recorded by the ACS on HST indicates these are S0 galaxies. One or
both of these galaxies may be the source of the gas, which might have been
expelled in a fast wind, by tidal stripping, or by ram-pressure stripping.
Subtraction of the ACS point-spread function from the image of the QSO reveals
the presence of a face-on spiral galaxy under the glare of the quasar; although
it is possible that this galaxy may be responsible for the Lyman limit
absorption, the exact alignment of the QSO with the center of the galaxy
suggests that the spiral is the quasar host.

relative strength of important forbidden high ionization lines like [NeV]3426
compared to HeII4686 and the relative strength of [FeX]6374 appear to show the
same range as in BLS1 galaxies. However, a trend of weaker
F([OI]6300)/F(Halpha) emission-line ratios is indicated for NLS1s compared to
BLS1s. To recover the broad emission-line profiles we used Gaussian components.
This approach indicates that the broad Hbeta profile can be well described with
a broad component (FWHM = 3275 +- 800 km/s) and an intermediate broad component
(FWHM = 1200 +- 300 km/s). The width of the broad component is in the typical
range of normal BLS1s. The emission-line flux that is associated with the broad

probability of error that are valid for various Rake combining schemes are
derived. The asynchronous system is modelled as a chip-synchronous system with
uniformly distributed timing jitter for the transmitted pulses of interfering
users. This model allows the analytical technique developed for the synchronous
case to be extended to the asynchronous case. An approximate closed-form
expression for the probability of bit error, expressed in terms of the
autocorrelation function of the transmitted pulse, is derived for the
asynchronous case. Then, transmission over an additive white Gaussian noise
channel is studied as a special case, and the effects of multiple-access
interference is investigated for both synchronous and asynchronous systems. The
analysis shows that the chip-synchronous assumption can result in
over-estimating the error probability, and the degree of over-estimation mainly
depends on the autocorrelation function of the ultra-wideband pulse and the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the system. Simulations studies
support the approximate analysis.

this context, an energy-efficient method for the joint estimation of an unknown

purely analog, in which each sensor simply amplifies and forwards the
noise-corrupted analog bservation to the fusion center for joint estimation.
The total transmission power across all the sensor nodes is minimized while
satisfying a distortion requirement on the joint estimate. The energy
efficiency of this analog approach is compared with previously proposed digital
approaches with and without coding. It is shown in our simulation that the
analog approach is more energy-efficient than the digital system without

Typically, in stochastic differential games the modulating process of the
diffusion equation describing the state flow is taken to be Markovian. Then
Nash equilibria or other types of solution such as Pareto equilibria are
constructed using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. But in a
non-Markovian setting the HJB method is not applicable. To examine the
non-Markovian case, this paper considers the situation in which the modulating
process is a fractional Brownian motion. Fractional noise calculus is used for
such models to find the Nash equilibria explicitly. Although fractional
Brownian motion is taken as the modulating process because of its versatility
in modeling in the fields of finance and networks, the approach in this paper
has the merit of being applicable to more general Gaussian stochastic
differential games with only slight conceptual modifications. This work has
applications in finance to stock price modeling which incorporates the effect
of institutional investors, and to stochastic differential portfolio games in
markets in which the stock prices follow diffusions modulated with fractional
Brownian motion.

known and well investigated problem. A common approach for solving this problem
is to use an information theoretic criterion, such as Minimum Description
Length (MDL) or the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The MDL estimator is
known to be a consistent estimator, robust against deviations from the Gaussian
assumption, and non-robust against deviations from the point source and/or
temporally or spatially white additive noise assumptions. Over the years
several alternative estimation algorithms have been proposed and tested.
Usually, these algorithms are shown, using computer simulations, to have
improved performance over the MDL estimator, and to be robust against
deviations from the assumed spatial model. Nevertheless, these robust
algorithms have high computational complexity, requiring several
multi-dimensional searches.
  In this paper, motivated by real life problems, a systematic approach toward
the problem of robust estimation of the number of sources using information
theoretic criteria is taken. An MDL type estimator that is robust against
deviation from assumption of equal noise level across the array is studied. The
consistency of this estimator, even when deviations from the equal noise level
assumption occur, is proven. A novel low-complexity implementation method
avoiding the need for multi-dimensional searches is presented as well, making
this estimator a favorable choice for practical applications.

pseudovector rather than a vector, then the Hamiltonian becomes PT symmetric.
The resulting non-Hermitian theory of electrodynamics is the analog of a
spinless quantum field theory in which a pseudoscalar field $\phi$ has a cubic
self-interaction of the form $i\phi^3$. The Hamiltonian for this cubic scalar
field theory has a positive spectrum, and it has recently been demonstrated
that the time evolution of this theory is unitary. The proof of unitarity
requires the construction of a new operator called C, which is then used to
define an inner product with respect to which the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint.
In this paper the corresponding C operator for non-Hermitian quantum
electrodynamics is constructed perturbatively. This construction demonstrates
the unitarity of the theory. Non-Hermitian quantum electrodynamics is a
particularly interesting quantum field theory model because it is
asymptotically free.

well-understood, since the well-known paper of Kostant and Rallis. Such a

factor as seen by an electron, G^e_A, is also required. While the vector
electroweak form factors provide information about the nucleon's charge and
magnetism, the axial form factor is related to the nucleon's spin. Its Q2=0

and its precise determination is of interest for tests of CKM unitarity. Most

these experiments are not sensitive to additional higher order corrections,
such as nucleon anapole contributions, that are present in parity-violating

spin 1/2: a|u> + b|d> can be converted into a superposition of the two
ferromagnetic states of a spin cluster: a|uu...uu> + b|dd...dd>. The physical
system is a cluster of seven dipolar-coupled nuclear spins of single-labeled
13C-benzene molecules in a liquid-crystalline matrix. In this complex system,
the pseudopure ground state and the required controlled unitary transformations
have been implemented. The experimental scheme can be considered as an explicit
model of quantum measurement.

  anticrossings of energies and widths","6 pages and 3 eps figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We show that when an isolated doublet of unbound states of a physical system
becomes degenerate for some values of the control parameters of the system, the
energy hypersurfaces representing the complex resonance energy eigenvalues as
functions of the control parameters have an algebraic branch point of rank one
in parameter space. Associated with this singularity in parameter space, the
scattering matrix, S_l(E), and the Green's function, G_l^(+)(k; r,r'), have one
double pole in the unphysical sheet of the complex energy plane. We
characterize the universal unfolding or deformation of a typical degeneracy
point of two unbound states in parameter space by means of a universal
2-parameter family of functions which is contact equivalent to the pole
position function of the isolated doublet of resonances at the exceptional
point and includes all small perturbations of the degeneracy condition up to
contact equivalence.

from their design parameters (length, size of the finite field, and designed
distance), such as bounds on the minimum distance and dimension of the code. In
this paper, it is shown that one can also deduce from the design parameters
whether or not a primitive, narrow-sense BCH contains its Euclidean or
Hermitian dual code. This information is invaluable in the construction of
quantum BCH codes. A new proof is provided for the dimension of BCH codes with
small designed distance, and simple bounds on the minimum distance of such
codes and their duals are derived as a consequence. These results allow us to
derive the parameters of two families of primitive quantum BCH codes as a
function of their design parameters.

dynamics of the mirror with perfect reflection moving in a quantum field.
Within the regime of linear response in terms of a first order expansion of the
mirror's displacement, the coarse-grained effective action is obtained by
integrating out quantum fields with the method of influence functional. The
semiclassical Langevin equation is derived, and is found to involve two levels
of backreaction effects on the dynamics of mirrors: radiation reaction induced
by the motion of the mirror and backreaction dissipation arising from
fluctuations in quantum fields via a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Although
the theorem of fluctuation and dissipation in linear response theory is of
model independence, the study from the first principles derivation shows that
the obtained theorem is also {\it independent} of the regulators introduced to
deal with short-distance divergences from quantum fields. Thus, when the method
of regularization is introduced to compute the dissipation and fluctuation
effects, this theorem must be fulfilled as the results are obtained by taking
the short-distance limit in the end of calculations. The backreaction effects
from vacuum fluctuations on moving mirrors are found to be hardly detected
while those effects from thermal fluctuations may be detectable.
