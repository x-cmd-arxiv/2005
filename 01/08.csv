Algol-type systems is not very well understood. In order to study the
underlying physics of these structures, we have calculated synthetic Halpha
spectra of TT Hya, which is an Algol-type eclipsing binary with an accretion
disc. Both the primary and secondary stars were considered in the calculations
as well as a disc surrounding the primary. The Roche model for the secondary
star was assumed. The synthetic spectra cover all the phases including primary
eclipse and are compared with the observed spectra. The influence of various
effects and free parameters of the disc on the emerging spectrum was studied.
This enabled us to put some constraints on the geometry, temperature, density
and velocity fields within the disc. Differences found between the observed and
synthetic spectra unravel the existence of a gas stream as well as a hotter
disc-gas interaction region. An additional cooler circumstellar region between
the C1 and C2 Roche surfaces is suggested to account for various observed
effects. A new computer code called {\sc{shellspec}} was created for this
purpose and is briefly described in this work as well. It is designed to solve
simple radiative transfer along the line of sight in 3D moving media. The
scattered light from a central object is taken into account assuming an
optically thin environment. Output intensities are then integrated through the
2D projection surface of a 3D object. The assumptions of the code include LTE
and optional known state quantities and velocity fields in 3D.

the profile shape during early collapse remains similar to the profile shape of
the initial equilibrium. The two-slope density structure divides the spherical
collapse history into a starless infall phase and a protostellar accretion
phase. The similarity of density profiles implies that Bonnor-Ebert fits to
observed column density maps may not distinguish spherical cores from oblate or
prolate cores, and may not distinguish static cores from collapsing cores. The
velocity profiles discriminate better than the density profiles between initial
geometries and between collapse ages. The infall velocity generally has a
subsonic maximum value, which is approximately equal to the initial velocity
dispersion times the ratio of collapse age to central free-fall time.
  Observations of starless core line profiles constrain collapse models.
Collapse from initial states which are strongly condensed and slightly prolate
is consistent with infall asymmetry observed around starless cores, and is more
consistent than collapse from initial states which are weakly condensed, and/or
oblate. Spherical models match observed inward speeds 0.05-0.09 km/s over
0.1-0.2 pc, if the collapse has a typical age 0.3-0.5 free fall times, and if
it began from a centrally condensed state which was not in stable equilibrium.

powerlaws. McCarthy and coworkers recently accounted for this trend with an
analytic model that includes the detailed effects of radiative cooling.
Interestingly, these authors found that cooling (and subsequent inflow of the
gas) naturally establishes approximate steady-state powerlaw entropy profiles
in the cores of clusters. However, the origin of this behavior and its
dependence on initial conditions have yet to be elucidated. In the present
study, we explain this trend in the context of the self-similar cooling wave
model developed previously by Bertschinger (1989). It is shown that the
logarithmic slope of the entropy profile in the cores of relaxed cooling flow
clusters is given by a simple analytic function that depends only on the
logarithmic slopes of the local gravitational potential and the cooling
function. We discuss a number of potentially interesting uses of the above
result, including: (1) a way of measuring the shapes of gravitational
potentials of cooling flow clusters (which may, for example, be compared with
the results of the standard hydrostatic equilibrium method); (2) a simple
method for constructing realistic analytic cluster models that include the

strong coupling between the soliton and the cavity mode. This coupling causes
the soliton to become phase-locked to the cavity mode, and produces step-like
anomalies on the soliton branch of the IV characteristics. If the coupling is
strong enough, the frequency of the cavity mode is greatly red-shifted from its

coupling between two adjacent flux qubits. The nontrivial dependence of the
SQUID's susceptibility on external flux makes it possible to continuously tune
the induced coupling from antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (FM). In
particular, for suitable parameters, the induced FM coupling can be
sufficiently large to overcome any possible direct AF inductive coupling
between the qubits.
  The main features follow from a classical analysis of the multi-qubit
potential. A fully quantum treatment yields similar results, but with a
modified expression for the SQUID susceptibility.

Higgs fields transforming under SU(5). Higgs doublets are instead embedded into
a four dimensional representation of the Sp(4) gauge group, and hence there is
no doublet-triplet splitting problem because there are no triplets. The Sp(4)
group contains enough matter to lie in the conformal window, causing its gauge
coupling to flow to a strongly-coupled infrared fixed-point at low energy,
naturally preserving gauge coupling unification to percent level accuracy.
Yukawa couplings, including the top, arise through dimension five operators
that are enhanced by the large anomalous dimension of the Higgs fields. Proton
decay mediated by dimension five operators is absent at the perturbative level.
It reappears, however, non-perturbatively due to Sp(4) instantons but the rate
is suppressed by a high power of the ratio of the dynamical scale to the
unification scale. With gravity- or gaugino-mediated supersymmetry breaking,
non-universal gaugino masses are predicted, satisfying specific one-loop
renormalization group invariant relations. These predictions should be easily
testable with the LHC and a linear collider.

from a quenched (almost sure) regime to an annealed (in average) one, for a

and independent law. The transition mechanism we study was first proposed in
the context of sums of identical independent random exponents by Ben Arous,
Bogachev and Molchanov in [Probab. Theory Related Fields 132 (2005) 579--612].
Let $p(x,t)$ be the survival probability at time $t$ of the random walk,
starting from site $x$, and let $L(t)$ be some increasing function of time. We
show that the empirical average of $p(x,t)$ over a box of side $L(t)$ has
different asymptotic behaviors depending on $L(t)$. T here are constants
$0<\gamma_1<\gamma_2$ such that if $L(t)\ge e^{\gamma t^{d/(d+2)}}$, with
$\gamma>\gamma_1$, a law of large numbers is satisfied and the empirical
survival probability decreases like the annealed one; if $L(t)\ge e^{\gamma
t^{d/(d+2)}}$, with $\gamma>\gamma_2$, also a central limit theorem is
satisfied. If ${L(t)\ll t}$, the averaged survival probability decreases like
the quenched survival probability. If $t\ll L(t)$ and $\log L(t)\ll
t^{d/(d+2)}$ we obtain an intermediate regime. Furthermore, when the dimension
$d=1$ it is possible to describe the fluctuations of the averaged survival
probability when $L(t)=e^{\gamma t^{d/(d+2)}}$ with $\gamma<\gamma_2$: it is
shown that they are infinitely divisible laws with a L\'{e}vy spectral function
which explodes when $x\to0$ as stable laws of characteristic exponent
$\alpha<2$. These results show that the quenched and annealed survival
probabilities correspond to a low- and high-temperature behavior of a
mean-field type phase transition mechanism.

$x''+x+\epsilon f(x,x')=0$. By performing a perturbative calculation based on
normal form theory we analytically obtain an $\O(\epsilon)$ approximation to
the Floquet multipliers that determine the stability of the synchronous
solution. The technique allows us to prove and generalize recent results
obtained using heuristic approaches, as well as reveal the structure of the
approximating equations. We illustrate the results in several examples, and
discuss extensions to the analysis of stability of multisynchronous states in
networks with complex architectures.

used to extract secret messages masked by chaos in secure communication
schemes. Recently, a simple defensive mechanism was presented to enhance the
security of chaotic parameter modulation schemes against return-map attacks.
Two techniques are combined in the proposed defensive mechanism: multistep
parameter modulation and alternative driving of two different transmitter
variables. This paper re-studies the security of this proposed defensive
mechanism against return-map attacks, and points out that the security was much
over-estimated in the original publication for both ciphertext-only attack and
known/chosen-plaintext attacks. It is found that a deterministic relationship
exists between the shape of the return map and the modulated parameter, and
that such a relationship can be used to dramatically enhance return-map attacks
thereby making them quite easy to break the defensive mechanism.

is reduced to a set of difference equations which give the Larmor radius and
phase of an ion on one cyclotron orbit in terms of these quantities a cyclotron
period earlier. From these difference equations an earlier result [Phys. Fluids

function expressed in wave-medium parameters and identifiable as the Planck

finite velocity of light $c$, $\eng=mc^2$ represents thereby the translational
kinetic energy of the wavetrain, $m=\hbarc\w/c^2$ being its inertial mass and
thereby the inertial mass of the particle. Based on the solutions we also write
down a set of semi-empirical equations for the particle's de Broglie wave
parameters. From the standpoint of overall modern experimental indications we
comment on the origin of mass implied by the solution.

are investigated by numerical simulations using a novel code that applies
semi-Lagrangian pseudospectral schemes. The diffusive character of the
turbulent transport of ideal impurities is demonstrated by relative-diffusion
analysis of the evolution of impurity puffs. Additional effects appear for
inertial impurities as a consequence of compressibility. First, the density of
inertial impurities is found to correlate with the vorticity of the electric
drift velocity, that is, impurities cluster in vortices of a precise
orientation determined by the charge of the impurity particles. Second, a
radial pinch scaling linearly with the mass--charge ratio of the impurities is
discovered. Theoretical explanation for these observations is obtained by
analysis of the model equations.

system requires an accurate model of the measurement interaction. Continuously
probing the collective spin of an Alkali atom cloud via its interaction with an
off-resonant optical probe is an important example of such a measurement where
realistic modeling at the quantum level is possible using standard techniques
from atomic physics. Typically, however, tutorial descriptions of this
technique have neglected the multilevel structure of realistic atoms for the
sake of simplification. In this paper we account for the full multilevel
structure of Alkali atoms and derive the irreducible form of the polarizability
Hamiltonian describing a typical dispersive quantum measurement. For a specific
set of parameters, we then show that semiclassical predictions of the theory
are consistent with our experimental observations of polarization scattering by
a polarized cloud of laser-cooled Cesium atoms. We also derive the
signal-to-noise ratio under a single measurement trial and use this to predict
the rate of spin-squeezing with multilevel Alkali atoms for arbitrary detuning
of the probe beam.
