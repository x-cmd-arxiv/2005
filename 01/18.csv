2003gd, which was discovered in M74 close to the end of its plateau phase. SN
2003gd is the first type II supernova to have a directly confirmed red
supergiant progenitor. We compare SN 2003gd with SN 1999em, a similar type II-P
supernova, and estimate an explosion date of 18th March 2003. We determine a
reddening towards the supernova of E(B-V) = 0.14+/-0.06, using three different
methods. We also calculate three new distances to M74 of 9.6+/-2.8 Mpc,
7.7+/-1.7 Mpc and 9.6+/-2.2 Mpc. The former was estimated using the
Standardised Candle Method (SCM), for type II supernovae, and the latter two
using the Brightest Supergiants Method (BSM). When combined with existing
kinematic and BSM distance estimates, we derive a mean value of 9.3+/-1.8 Mpc.
SN 2003gd was found to have a lower tail luminosity compared to other
``normal'' type II-P SNe bringing into question the nature of this supernova.
We present a discussion concluding that this is a ``normal'' type II-P
supernova which is consistent with the observed progenitor mass of 8(+4/-2) Mo.

massive black holes from primordial seeds, remnants of the first generation of
stars in a hierarchical structure formation scenario. Our model traces the
build-up of MBHs from an early epoch, and follows the merger history of dark
matter halos and their associated holes via Monte Carlo realizations of the
merger hierarchy from early times to the present time. The sequence of minor
and major mergers experienced by galactic halos in their hierarchical growth
affects the merger history of MBHs embedded in their nuclei. So, if the
formation route for the assembly of SMBHs dates back to the early universe, a
large number of BH interactions is inevitable. Binary black holes coalescence
timescales can be long enough for a third BH to fall in and interact with the
central binary. These BH triple interactions lead typically to the final
expulsion of one of the three bodies and to the recoil of the binary. Also,
asymmetric emission of gravitational waves in the last stages of the black hole
merging can give a recoil velocity to the centre of mass of the coalescing
binary. This scenario leads to the prediction of a population of intermediate
mass BHs (IMBHs) wandering in galaxy halos at the present epoch. We compute the
luminosity distribution produced by these IMBHs accreting from their
circumstellar medium. We find that in a Milky Way-sized galaxy they are unable
to account for sources with luminosities > 1e39 erg/s unless they carry a
baryonic remnant from which they are able to accrete for a long time. We also
find that, for typical spiral galaxies, the bright end of the point source
distribution correlates with the mass of the galaxy, and the most luminous
sources are expected to be found in the disk.

XMM-Newton, the temperature declines by around a factor of two in the central
150 kpc or so in radius, and the abundance increases from about one-fifth to
over one-half solar. The cooling time is less than 10 Gyr inside a radius of
130 kpc. EPIC fits to the central region are consistent with a cooling flow of
around 100 solar masses per year. Broad-band fits to the RGS spectra extracted
from the central 2 arcmin are also consistent with a cooling flow of the same
magnitude; with a preferred low-temperature cut-off of essentially zero. The
data appear to suggest (albeit at low significance levels below formal
detection limits) the presence of the important thermometer lines from Fe XVII
at 15, 17 Angstrom rest wavelength, characteristic of gas at temperatures ~ 0.3
keV. The measured flux in each line is converted to a mass deposition estimate
by comparison with a classical cooling flow model, and once again values at the

whilst lower than those of previous generations of X-ray observatories, are
consistent with those obtained from UV data for this object. This raises the

state. Two patterns of correlated X-ray-optical/nIR behavior were found. During
the hard state the optical/nIR and X-ray fluxes correlated well, with a nIR vs.
X-ray flux relation similar to the relation between X-ray and radio fluxes
found in previous studies of GX 339-4 and other black hole binaries. As GX
339-4 went through an intermediate state the optical/nIR fluxes decreased
rapidly and once it had entered the spectrally soft state, the optical/nIR
spectrum was much bluer and the ratio of X-ray to nIR flux was higher by a

nIR-changes preceded those in the X-rays by more than 2 weeks, indicating a
disk origin of the nIR. We present SEDs, including radio data, and discuss
possible sources for the optical/nIR emission. We conclude that in the hard

that in none of the X-ray states X-ray reprocessing is the dominant source of

halos which include the feedback from disk/bar onto the halo in order to test
the work by El-Zant & Shlosman (2002). The latter used the Liapunov exponents
to analyze the fate of bars in analytical asymmetric halos. We find: (1) The
bar growth is similar in all rigid axisymmetric and triaxial halos. (2) Bars in
live models vertically buckle and form a pseudobulge with a boxy/peanut shape.
(3) In live axisymmetric halos, the bar strength varies little during the
secular evolution. The bar pattern speed anticorrelates with the halo core
size. The bar strength is larger for smaller disk-to-halo mass ratios within
disk radii, the bar size correlates with the halo core sizes, and the bar
pattern speeds -- with the halo central mass concentration. Bars embedded in
live triaxial halos have a starkly different fate: they dissolve on ~1.5-5 Gyr
due to the onset of chaos over continuous zones, leaving behind a weak oval
distortion. The onset of chaos is related to the halo triaxiality, the fast
rotating bar and the halo cuspiness. Before the bar dissolves, the region
outside it develops strong spiral structures, especially in the live triaxial
halos. (4) More angular momentum is absorbed by the triaxial halos as compared
to the axisymmetric models and its exchange is mediated by resonances. (5)
Cuspy halos are more susceptible than flat-core halos to having their
prolateness washed out by the bar. We analyze these results in terms of the
stability of trajectories and development of chaos. We set constraints on the
triaxiality of DM halos by comparing our predictions to recent observations of
bars out to z~1.

un-associated eclipsing binaries. Such systems contaminate searches for
transiting planets, in particular in crowded fields where blends are common.
Spectroscopic follow-up observations on large aperture telescopes have been
used to reject these blends, but the results are not always conclusive. Our
approach exploits the fact that a blend with a eclipsing binary changes its
shape during eclipse. We analyze original imaging data from the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), which were used to discover planet
transit candidates. Adopting a technique developed in weak gravitational
lensing to carefully correct for the point spread function which varies both
with time and across the field, we demonstrate that ellipticities can be
measured with great accuracy using an ensemble of images. Applied to OGLE-TR-3
and OGLE-TR-56, two of the planetary transit candidates, we show that both
systems are blended with fainter stars, as are most other stars in the OGLE
fields. Moreover, while we do not detect shape change when TR-56 undergoes
transits, TR-3 exhibits a significant shape change during eclipses. We
therefore conclude that TR-3 is indeed a blend with an eclipsing binary, as has
been suggested from other lines of evidence. The probability that its shape
change is caused by residual systematics is found to be less than 0.6%. Our
technique incurs no follow-up cost and requires little human interaction. As
such it could become part of the data pipeline for any planetary transit search
to minimize contamination by blends. We briefly discuss its relevance for the
Kepler mission and for binary star detection.

framework of the nucleated instability hypothesis. We approximate the
protoplanet as a spherically symmetric, isothermal, self-gravitating classical
ideal gas envelope in equilibrium, around a rigid body of given mass and
density, with the gaseous envelope required to fill the Hill-sphere. Starting
only with a core of given mass and an envelope gas density at the core surface,
the equilibria are calculated without prescribing the total protoplanetary mass
or nebula density. The static critical core masses of the protoplanets for the
typical orbits of 1, 5.2, and 30 AU, around a parent star of 1 solar mass are
found to be 0.1524, 0.0948, and 0.0335 Earth masses, respectively, for standard
nebula conditions (Kusaka et al. 1970). These values are much lower than
currently admitted ones primarily because our model is isothermal and the
envelope is in thermal equilibrium with the nebula. For a given core, multiple
solutions (at least two) are found to fit into the same nebula. We extend the
concept of the static critical core mass to the local and global critical core
mass. We conclude that the 'global static critical core mass' marks the meeting

quantify cluster morphology using the power ratio method (Buote & Tsai 1995).
The power ratios are constructed from the moments of the X-ray surface
brightness and are related to a cluster's dynamical state. We find that, as
expected qualitatively from hierarchical models of structure formation,
high-redshift clusters have more substructure and are dynamically more active
than low-redshift clusters. Specifically, the clusters with z>0.5 have
significantly higher average third and fourth order power ratios than the lower
redshift clusters. Of the power ratios, $P_3/P_0$ is the most unambiguous
indicator of an asymmetric cluster structure, and the difference in $P_3/P_0$
between the two samples remains significant even when the effects of noise and
other systematics are considered. After correcting for noise, we apply a linear
fit to $P_3/P_0$ versus redshift and find that the slope is greater than zero
at better than 99% confidence. This observation of structure evolution
indicates that dynamical state may be an important systematic effect in cluster
studies seeking to constrain cosmology, and when calibrated against numerical
simulations, structure evolution will itself provide interesting bounds on

magnetic fields are subject to very fast growing plasma instabilities driven by
the anisotropy of the plasma pressure (viscous stress) with respect to the
local direction of the magnetic field. Such an anisotropy will naturally arise
in any weakly magnetized plasma that has low collisionality and is subject to
stirring. The magnetic field must be sufficiently weak for the instabilities to
occur, viz., beta>Re^{1/2}. The instabilities are captured by the extended MHD
model with Braginskii viscosity. However, their growth rates are proportional
to the wavenumber down to the ion gyroscale, so MHD equations with Braginskii
viscosity are not well posed and a fully kinetic treatment is necessary. The
instabilities can lead to magnetic fields in clusters being amplified from seed
strength of ~10^{-18} G to dynamically important strengths of ~10 microG on
cosmologically trivial time scales (~10^8 yr). The fields produced during the
amplification stage are at scales much smaller than observed. Predicting the
saturated field scale and structure will require a kinetic theory of magnetized
cluster turbulence.

exotic physical processes that are inaccessible to modern accelerators. Some of
these processes may be due to as-yet unknown physics at the grand unification

discuss the status of current and proposed neutrino telescope projects based on

radio-based and acoustic-based detectors should be sensitive to cosmic
neutrinos above 1 EeV originating through the so-called GZK process. A

several authors have proposed modifications of Newton's law of gravity at

expansion. Inspired by such suggestions, we attempt to constrain possible
deviations from Newtonian gravity by means of the clustering of SDSS (Sloan
Digital Sky Survey) galaxies. To be specific, we assume a simple modification
of Newton's law with an additional Yukawa-type term characterized by the
amplitude \alpha and the length scale \lambda. Adopting spatially-flat
universes dominated by cold dark matter and/or dark energy, we solve a linear
perturbation equation for the growth of density fluctuations. In particular, we
find an exact analytic solution for the Einstein -- de Sitter case. Following
the Peacock-Dodds prescription, we compute the nonlinear power spectra of mass
fluctuations, perform a statistical comparison with the SDSS galaxy data, and
derive constraints in the \alpha-\lambda plane; for instance, we obtain the
constraints of -0.5<\alpha <0.6 and -0.8<\alpha<0.9 (99.7% confidence level)

a fundamental input which, besides its own effect on the galaxy evolution,
defines the characteristic collapse time-scale or gas infall rate onto the

and compared these results with optical upper limits for a large sample of

which the upper limits are not compatible with their X-ray afterglow properties
within the context of any blast wave model. This sparse sample does not allow
us to conclusively determine the cause of this optical/near-IR deficit.
Extinction in the host galaxy is a likely cause, but high redshifts and
different afterglow mechanisms might also explain the deficit in some cases. We
note that the three bursts appear to have higher than average gamma-ray peak
fluxes. In a magnitude versus time diagram the bursts are separated from the
majority of bursts with a detected optical/near-IR afterglow. However, two GRBs
with an optical afterglow (one of which is highly reddened) also fall in this
region with dark bursts, making it likely that dark bursts are at the faint end
of the set of optically detected bursts, and therefore the dark bursts likely
form a continuum with the bursts with a detected optical afterglow. Our work
provides a useful diagnostic tool for follow-up observations for potentially
dark bursts; applied to the events detected with the Swift satellite, it will
significantly increase our sample of truly dark bursts and shed light upon

Aguerri, Balcells, & Peletier (2001, A&A, 367, 428) investigated this question
with N-body simulations of the accretion of dense, spheroidal satellites. Here,
we expand on that work by running N-body simulations of the accretion of
satellites that have realistic densities. Satellites are modelled as disk-bulge
structures with their own dark-matter halo. A realistic density scaling with
the primary galaxy is ensured by using the Tully-Fisher relation. Our merger
models show that most satellites disrupt before reaching the center. However, a
bulge-disk decomposition of the surface density profile after the accretion
shows an increase of both the B/D and the Sersic index n of the bulge. The
increase in the mass and concentration of the inner Sersic component is due to
inward piling up of disk material due to transient bars during the satellite
orbital decay. This research is described in Eliche-Moral, Balcells, Aguerri, &

Using spatially-resolved spectroscopy of discrete regions, hardness ratio and
temperature maps, we show that all three clusters display a complex temperature
structure. In the case of A1750, a double cluster, we argue that the observed
temperature structure is not only related to the ongoing merger but also to
previous merger events. A2065 seems an excellent example of a `compact merger',
i.e. when the centres of the two clusters have just started to interact,
producing a shock in the ICM. Using comparisons with numerical simulations and
complementary optical data, the highly complex temperature structure evident in
A3921 is interpreted as an off-axis merger between two unequal mass components.
These results illustrate the complex physics of merger events. The relaxation
time can be larger than the typical time between merger events, so that the
present day morphology of clusters depends not only on on-going interaction but
also on the more ancient formation history.

ground-based and HST F555W and F814W observations. Our investigation spans a
broad range in luminosity (-20.5>M_r>-23.0) and a wide FOV of 1.5x1.5 Mpc^2.
Since the A2218 and A2390 samples are very similar, we can combine them and
analyse a total of 96 E+S0 galaxies at z~0.2. We construct the Faber-Jackson
relation (FJR) for all E+S0s and detect a modest luminosity evolution. The
average offset from the local FJR in Gunn r-band is (DeltaM_r)=0.32+-0.22^m.
Less-massive galaxies show a trend for a larger evolution than more-massive
galaxies. HST/WFPC2 surface brightness profile fits were used to derive
structural parameters. For 34 E+S0 galaxies which enter the Fundamental Plane
(FP) we deduce a mild evolution in Gunn r with a zero-point offset of
0.10+-0.06, corresponding to 0.31+-0.18^m. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies
are uniformly distributed along the FP with a similar scatter of 0.1 dex. We
find little evidence for differences between the populations of ellipticals and
S0s. Lenticulars induce on average a larger evolution of 0.44+-0.18^m than
ellipticals with 0.02+-0.21^m. The M/L ratios at z=0.2 are offset by
(Deltalog(M/L_r))=-0.12+-0.06 dex compared to those of Coma. Our results can be
reconciled with a passive evolution of the stellar populations and a high

in the second partition, the basic bipartite Yule process assumes that as each
primary node is added to the network, it links to multiple secondary nodes, and
with probability, $\alpha$, each new link may connect to a newly appearing
secondary node. The number of links from a new primary node follows some

existing secondary nodes follow a preferential attachment rule. With

scattering properties, including medium effects, in terms of the singlet and
triplet scattering lengths and the range of the atom-atom potential and
provides a link between a microscopic description of Feshbach scattering and
more phenomenological approaches. It permits the calculation of medium effects
on the resonance coming from the occupation of closed channel states. The
examination of such effects are demonstrated to be of particular relevance to
an experimentally important Feshbach resonance for $^{40}$K atoms. We analyze a
recent rethermalization rate experiment on $^{40}$K and demonstrate that a
measurement of the temperature dependence of this rate can determine the
magnetic moment of the Feshbach molecule. Finally, the energy dependence of the
Feshbach interaction is shown to introduce a negative effective range inversely
proportional to the width of the resonance. Since our theory is based on a
microscopic multi-channel picture, it allows the explicit calculation of
corrections to commonly used approximations such as the neglect of the
effective range and the treatment of the Feshbach molecule as a point boson.

should be related to that of reference frame. Poincare' proposed to define the
simultaneity of two events by means of light signals following what is nowadays
known as the Einstein simultaneity convention. The need of a simultaneity
definition is present also in general relativity and in curved spacetimes in
order to provide the observers with a coordinate time.
  It is recognized that the old Einstein simultaneity convention is nothing but
a connection on a suitable trivial bundle that defines the reference frame.
Unfortunately, it has a non vanishing holonomy in curved and even in flat
spacetimes a fact that makes it almost useless. We point out the advantage of
local simultaneity conventions showing that they are represented by local
simultaneity connections. Among them there is one, uniquely determined by the
reference frame, which is particularly well-behaved globally.

cosmic rays are sensitive to QCD interactions at very small momentum fractions
x where nonlinear effects should become important. The leading partons from the
projectile acquire large random transverse momenta as they pass through the
strong field of the target nucleus, which breaks up their coherence. This leads
to a steeper x_F-distribution of leading hadrons as compared to low energy
collisions, which in turn reduces the position of the shower maximum Xmax. We
argue that high-energy hadronic interaction models should account for this
effect, caused by the approach to the black-body limit, which may shift fits of
the composition of the cosmic ray spectrum near the GZK cutoff towards lighter
elements. We further show that present data on Xmax(E) exclude that the rapid ~
1/x^0.3 growth of the saturation boundary (which is compatible with RHIC and
HERA data) persists up to GZK cutoff energies. Measurements of pA collisions at

for energies up to 1 GeV. At energies of the first resonance region and below,
precise values for the electromagnetic polarizabilities and

the underlying mechanism is a $t$-channel $\sigma$-meson exchange. A similar

  Standard Model","latex, 2 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  Recently, we have remarked that the main effect of Quantum Gravity(QG) will
be to modify the measure of integration of loop integrals in a renormalizable
Quantum Field Theory. In the Standard Model this approach leads to definite
predictions, depending on only one arbitrary parameter. In particular, we found
that the maximal attainable velocity for particles is not the speed of light,
but depends on the specific couplings of the particles within the Standard
Model. Also birrefringence occurs for charged leptons, but not for gauge
bosons. Our predictions could be tested in the next generation of neutrino
detectors such as NUBE. In this paper, we elaborate more on this proposal. In
particular, we extend the dimensional regularization prescription to include
Lorentz invariance violations(LIV) of the measure, preserving gauge invariance.
Then we comment on the consistency of our proposal.

dynamics of N M5-branes. The open membrane instanton interactions between the
M5-branes give rise to exponential potentials which are too steep for inflation
individually but lead to inflation when combined together. The resulting type
of inflation, known as assisted inflation, facilitates considerably the
requirement of having all moduli, except the inflaton, stabilized at the
beginning of inflation. During inflation the distances between the M5-branes,
which correspond to the inflatons, grow until they reach the size of the
S^1/Z_2 orbifold. At this stage the M5-branes will reheat the universe by
dissolving into the boundaries through small instanton transitions. Further
flux and non-perturbative contributions become important at this late stage,
bringing inflation to an end and stabilizing the moduli. We find that with
moderate values for N, one obtains both a sufficient amount of e-foldings and
the right size for the spectral index.

  A. For an operad $\oo$ in $\ab$, let $A$ be a simplicial $\oo$-algebra such
that $A_m$ is the $\oo$-subalgebra generated by $(\sum_{i = 0}^{m}
s_i(A_{m-1}))$, for every $n$, and let $\N A$ be the Moore complex of $A$. Then
\[ d (\N_m A) = \sum_{I} \gamma(\oo_{p} \otimes \bigcap_{i \in I_1}\ker d_i
\otimes ... \otimes \bigcap_{i \in I_{p}}\ker d_i) \] where the sum runs over
those partitions of $[m-1]$, $I = (I_1,...,I_p)$, $p \geq 1$, and $\gamma$ is
the action of $\oo$ on $A$.
  B. Let $G$ be a simplicial group with Moore complex $\N G$ in which the
normal subgroup of $G_n$ generated by the degenerate elements in dimension $n$
is the proper $G_n$. Then $d(\N_nG) = \prod_{I,J}[\bigcap_{i \in I}\ker d_i,
\bigcap_{j \in J}\ker d_j]$, for $I,J \subseteq [n-1]$ with $I \cup J = [n-1]$.

object.
  The former result completes and generalizes results from Ak\c{c}a and Arvasi,

to the problem is different from that of the cited works. We have first
succeeded with a proof for the case of algebras over an operad by introducing a
different description of the adjoint inverse of the normalization functor $\N:
\sab \to \ch$. For the case of simplicial groups, we have then adapted the
construction for the adjoint inverse used for algebras to get a simplicial
group $G \boxtimes \lb$ from the Moore complex of a simplicial group $G$. This
construction could be of interest in itself.

for supernovae dynamics and neutron star properties. The $only$ way to probe
such region of the isovector $EOS$ in terrestrial laboratories is through very
dissipative collisions of asymmetric (up to exotic) heavy ions from low to
relativistic energies. A general introduction to the topic is firstly
presented. We pass then to a detailed discussion on the $neck-fragmentation$

related isospin dynamics. From Stochastic Mean Field simulations the isospin
effects on all the phases of the reaction dynamics are thoroughly analysed,
from the fast nucleon emission to the mid-rapidity fragment formation up to the
dynamical fission of the $spectator$ residues. Simulations have been performed
with an increasing stiffness of the symmetry term of the $EOS$.
  Some differences have been noticed, especially for the fragment charge
asymmetry. New isospin effects have been revealed from the correlation of
fragment asymmetry with dynamical quantities at the freeze-out time. A series
of isospin sensitive observables to be further measured are finally listed.

to compute the energy loss rate for a non-relativistic particle moving through
a highly ionized plasma. No restriction is made on the charge, mass, or speed
of this particle. It is, however, assumed that the plasma is not strongly
coupled in the sense that the dimensionless plasma coupling parameter
g=e^2\kappa_D/ 4\pi T is small, where \kappa_D is the Debye wave number of the
plasma. To leading and next-to-leading order in this coupling, dE/dx is of the
generic form g^2 \ln[C g^2]. The precise numerical coefficient out in front of
the logarithm is well known. We compute the constant C under the logarithm
exactly for arbitrary particle speeds. Our exact results differ from
approximations given in the literature. The differences are in the range of 20%
for cases relevant to inertial confinement fusion experiments. The same method
is also employed to compute the rate of momentum loss for a projectile moving
in a plasma, and the rate at which two plasmas at different temperatures come
into thermal equilibrium. Again these calculations are done precisely to the
order given above. The loss rates of energy and momentum uniquely define a
Fokker-Planck equation that describes particle motion in the plasma. The
coefficients determined in this way are thus well-defined, contain no arbitrary
parameters or cutoffs, and are accurate to the order described. This
Fokker-Planck equation describes the longitudinal straggling and the transverse
diffusion of a beam of particles. It should be emphasized that our work does
not involve a model, but rather it is a precisely defined evaluation of the
leading terms in a well-defined perturbation theory.

monomer and multimer solute traps are obtained and possible structures for
these species are discussed. ""Dipole coagulation"" (stepwise growth of the
solute cluster around the cavity electron) predicted by Mozumder in 1972 is
observed. Acetonitrile monomer is shown to solvate the electron by its methyl
group, just like the alkane solvent does. The electron is dipole-bound to the
CN group; the latter points away from the cavity. The resulting negatively
charged species has a binding energy of 0.4 eV and absorbs in the infrared.
Molecules of straight-chain aliphatic alcohols solvate the excess electron by
their OH groups; at equilibrium, the predominant electron trap is a trimer or a
tetramer; the binding energy of this solute trap is ca. 0.8 eV. Trapping by
smaller clusters is opposed by the entropy which drives the equilibrium towards
the electron in a solvent trap. For alcohol monomers, the trapping does not
occur; a slow proton transfer reaction occurs instead. For acetonitrile
monomer, the trapping is favored energetically but the thermal detachment is
rapid (ca. 1 ns).

the reasons for this phenomena had been unveiled and shown to be attributed to
two antagonistic nucleation processes during the polymerization of the cell's
actin cytoskeleton : the (ordinary) spontaneous nucleation and the dendritic
nucleation processes. Whereas spontaneous nucleations generate actin filaments
growing in different directions and hence create motions in random directions,
dendritic nucleations provide a unidirectional growth. Since dendritic growth
exhibits stochastic fluctuations, spontaneous nucleation may eventually compete
or even dominate, which results in a reorientation of filament growth and hence
a new direction of cell motion. The event of reorientation takes place at
instants of vanishing polarity of the actin skeleton.

given by generalizing the thermodynamical evolutionary process leading to
equilibrium in Statistical Mechanics. And in this formulism, when quantum
objects instead of classical objects are used as the objects in the game, it's
naturally leads to the so-called Quantum Game Theory, but with a slight
difference in the definition of strategy state of players: the probability
distribution is replaced with a density matrix. Further more, both games of
correlated and independent players can be reached in this single framework,
while traditionally, they are treated separately by Non-cooperative Game Theory
and Coalitional Game Theory. Because of the density matrix is used as state of
players, besides classical correlated strategy, quantum entangled states can
also be used as strategies, which is an entanglement of strategies between
players, and it is different with the entanglement of objects' states as in the
so-called Quantum Game Theory. At last, in the form of density matrix, a class
of quantum games, where the payoff matrixes are commutative, can be reduced

known as ""locking"" and has previously been observed for other correlation
measures, such as the accessible information, entanglement cost and the
logarithmic negativity.

tool in quantum information theory.

find that the behavior of the capacitance is widely different depending on
whether the system is in the magnetic or charge polarized phases. In the
magnetic phase, the capacitance is dominated by the presence of the edge states
while the ribbon width is small. As the ribbon becomes wider, the capacitance
remains with large magnitudes as the system develops into metallic zigzag

corresponds to the semiconducting nanotubes and the system is in the charge
polarized phase also. The latter behavior could be understood by the presence
of an energy gap for charge excitations. In the BN (BCN) nanotubes and ribbons,
the electronic structure is always like of semiconductors. The calculated
