dark matter density spikes in the galactic halo as a possible source of
ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. We estimate the possible flux in a way that does
not depend on detailed assumptions about the density profiles of dark matter

annihilation cross sections below the unitarity bounds for superheavy dark
matter if the particles can form dense cores in dark matter substructure, and
it provides estimates for core sizes and densities. The ensuing clumpy source

using SHARC II at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. The spatial resolution
of the raw images (9 arcsec) has been enhanced by a factor of three using the
HiRes deconvolution procedure. We find that at this wavelength and signal to
noise ratio (~ 12), the observed morphology is that of a simple inclined ring
(i ~ 70 deg), with little or no other apparent structure; this is the first
observation that shows clearly the ring morphology of the disk. We have
combined our 350 micron data with Spitzer Space Telescope images at 24, 70, and
160 microns in order to estimate the 2-dimensional spatial variation of
relative column density (""tau map"") using our DISKFIT procedure. The tau map is
based on the following physical assumptions: (1) the wavelength variation of
opacity is the same throughout the disk, (2) the radial variation of dust
temperature is dictated by the energy balance of individual grains in the
stellar radiation field, and (3) the vertical scale height of the disk follows
a power-law radial variation. The results confirm the ring-like morphology, but
also show that the geometric center is displaced from the star by about 8 AU
and that the ring has an apocentric enhancement of approximately 14% in
integrated column density. If we interpret the displacement in terms of
elliptical orbital motion due to gravitational perturbation by an unseen
planet, then the implied forced eccentricity is ~ 0.06; dynamical modeling then
predicts an apocentric density enhancement consistent with that inferred from
the tau map.

clusters with cool cores and abundance peaks are likely associated with the
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) which dwell in cluster cores. The width of
the abundance peaks is however significantly broader than the BCG light
distribution, suggesting that some gas motions are transporting metals
originating from within the BCG. Assuming that this process can be treated as
diffusive and using the brightest X-ray cluster A426 (Perseus) as an example,
we estimate that a diffusion coefficient of the order of $2 10^{29} {\rm cm^2
s^{-1}}$ is needed to explain the width of the observed abundance profiles.
Much lower (higher) diffusion coefficients would result in too peaked (too
shallow) profiles. Such diffusion could be produced by stochastic gas motions
and our analysis provides constraints on the product of their characteristic
velocity and their spatial coherence scale. We speculate that the activity of
the supermassive black hole of the BCG is driving the stochastic gas motions in
cluster cores. When combined with the assumption that the dissipation of the
same motions is a key gas heating mechanism, one can estimate both the velocity
and the spatial scale of such a diffusive processes.

it includes all multipolar contributions to the force, and it can be used to
calculate multi-body as well as pairwise forces. We also present several
numerical examples, including host fluids with finite conductivities. The force
between spheres approaches the dipole-dipole limit, as expected, at large

accounts not only for Kondo correlations but also for the spin splitting and
spin accumulation out of equilibrium. We show that the Kondo resonances, split
by the applied bias voltage, may be spin polarized. A left-right asymmetry in
the coupling strength and/or spin polarization of the electrodes significantly
affects both the spin accumulation and the weight of the split Kondo resonances
out of equilibrium. The effects are observable in the nonlinear differential
conductance. We also discuss the influence of decoherence on the Kondo

geometrodynamics by extending the ADM phase space for canonical general
relativity to that consisting of York's mean exterior curvature time, conformal
three-metric and their momenta. Accordingly, an additional constraint is
introduced, called the conformal constraint. In terms of the new canonical
variables, a diffeomorphism constraint is derived from the original momentum
constraint. The Hamiltonian constraint then takes a new form. It turns out to
be the sum of an expression that previously appeared in the literature and
extra terms quadratic in the conformal constraint. The complete set of the
conformal, diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints are shown to be of first
class through the explicit construction of their Poisson brackets. The extended
algebra of constraints has as subalgebras the Dirac algebra for the

hole solutions with Skyrme hair. The spherically symmetric black hole skyrmion
with B=1 was the first discovered counter example of the no-hair conjecture for
black holes. Recently we found the B=2 axially symmetric black hole skyrmion.
In this system, the black hole at the center of the skyrmion absorbs the baryon
number partially, leaving fractional charge outside the horizon. Therefore the
baryon number is no longer conserved. We examine the B=1, 2 black hole
solutions in detail in this paper. The model has a natural extension to the
gauged version which can describe monopole black hole skyrmions. Callan and
Witten discussed the monopole catalysis of proton decay within the Skyrme
model. We apply the idea to the Einstein-Maxwell-Skyrme system and obtain
monopole black hole skyrmions. Remarkably there exist multi-black hole skyrmion
solutions in which the gravitational, electromagnetic, and strong forces
between the monopoles are all in balance. The solutions turn out to be stable

for deriving an effective current generating bremsstrahlung of arbitrary number

to two and more scatterers, is obtained. For the case of static color centers
an expression for energy loss induced by usual bremsstrahlung of lowest-order
with allowance for an effective temperature-induced gluon mass and finite mass
of the projectile (heavy quark), is derived. The detailed analysis of
contribution to radiation energy loss associated with existence of effective
three-gluon vertex induced by hot QCD medium, is performed. It is shown that in
general, the bremsstrahlung associated with this vertex have no sharp direction
(as in the case of usual bremsstrahlung) and therefore here, we can expect an
absence of suppression effect due to multiple scattering. For the case of two
color static scattering centers it was shown that the problem of calculation of
bremsstrahlung induced by four-gluon hard thermal loop (HTL) vertex correction
can be reduced to the problem of the calculation of bremsstrahlung induced by
three-gluon HTL correction. It was shown that for limiting value of soft gluon
occupation number $N_{\bf k}\sim 1/\alpha_s$ all higher processes of
bremsstrahlung of arbitrary number of soft gluons become of the same order in
