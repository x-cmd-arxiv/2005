line-of-sight. The changing delay in the propagation of photons produces an
apparent deceleration of the planet across the sky throughout the transit. This
persistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the
transit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly
symmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate
than egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such
as Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this
asymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and
planetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the
orbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}. Therefore, this effect constitutes a new
method for a purely dynamical determination of the mass of the star, which is
currently inferred indirectly with theoretical uncertainties based on spectral
modeling. Radial velocity data for the reflex motion of the star can then be
used to determine the planet's mass. Although orbital eccentricity could
introduce a larger asymmetry than the light propagation delay, the eccentricity
is expected to decay by tidal dissipation to negligible values for a close-in
planet with no perturbing third body. Future detection of the eclipse of a
planet's emission by its star could be used to measure the light propagation
delay across the orbital diameter, 46.7(R/7x10^{11}cm) seconds, and also
determine the stellar mass from the orbital period.

careful analysis of the spectral line shapes revealed a pattern of variations
consistent with the presence of another star whose motion produced the
asymmetries observed in the spectral lines of the brightest star. Detailed

rare nature of the sought-after signal. I developed a Bayesian transit
detection algorithm and tested it through Monte Carlo simulations. This led to
a number of improvements to the algorithm, resulting in a maximum likelihood
box-fitting approach that is simpler and, for detection purposes, more
effective. I also developed an empirical model of the intrinsic
micro-variability of the parent stars, which constitutes one of the main
performance limitations for space-based transit searches, and used this model
to optimise variability filters. These tools were used to identify optimal
regions of the stellar parameter space to be targeted by missions such as CoRoT

CoRoT blind transit detection exercise. Recently, the same tools have been used
to analyse ground-based data from the University of New South Wales planet

relations can be expressed as a ratio of the different energies that is a
function of redshift (for both the Amati and Ghirlanda relations) and beaming
fraction f_B (for the Ghirlanda relation). The most rigorous test, which allows
bursts to be at any redshift, corroborates Nakar & Piran's result--88% of the
BATSE bursts are inconsistent with the Amati relation--while only 1.6% of the
bursts are inconsistent with the Ghirlanda relation if f_B=1. Even when we
allow for a real dispersion in the Amati relation we find an inconsistency.
Modelling the redshift distribution results in an energy ratio distribution for
the Amati relation that is shifted by an order of magnitude relative to the
observed distribution; any sub-population satisfying the Amati relation can
comprise at most ~18% of our burst sample. A similar analysis of the Ghirlanda

indicate that these relations are an artifact of the selection effects of the

investigate the case where in addition to cold dark matter a light thermal
gravitino with fixed effective temperature contributes significantly to the
matter density. In that case the gravitino density is proportional to its mass,
and we find an upper limit m_{3/2} < 16 eV (2 sigma). This translates into a
bound on the scale of supersymmetry breaking, Lambda_{susy} < 260 TeV, for
models of supersymmetric gauge mediation in which the gravitino is the lightest
supersymmetric particle.

explained if the circumnuclear dust is distributed in discrete clumps. Our aim

models. Some of the clumpy models have a weak or even absent 10 micron feature,
but so do some of the smooth models. On the whole the SEDs of clumpy and smooth

at edge-on inclinations appears to be less deep in the clumpy models than in
the smooth models, and the average flux in the near-infrared regime is stronger
in the clumpy models. Moreover, at these inclinations the clumpy models have a
slightly wider SED. Whether these differences are unique enough to be used as a
diagnostic for clumpiness of AGN tori is not yet clear.

parameterized by the donor's specific entropy. This produces a range in the
relationships between system observables, such as orbital period, $\Porb$, and

$\Mdot$ can range over several orders of magnitude at fixed $\Porb$. We
determine the unique relation between $\Mdot$ and $M_2$ in the AM CVn systems
with known donor to accretor mass ratios, $q=M_2/M_1$. We use structural
arguments, as well as each system's photometric behavior, to place limits on
$\Mdot$ and $M_2$ in each. Most systems allow a factor of about 3 variation in
$\Mdot$, although V803 Cen, if the current estimates of its $q$ are accurate,
is an exception and must have $M_2 \approx 0.02 \msun$ and $\Mdot \approx

temperature, $T_c$, range and correlate $T_c$ with $M_2$. We examine how
variations in donor specific entropy across the white dwarf family

years. Each of the identical molecular units can contain as few as two and up
to several dozens of paramagnetic ions (spins). Although these materials appear
as macroscopic samples, i.e. crystals or powders, the intermolecular magnetic
interactions are utterly negligible as compared to the intramolecular
interactions. Therefore, measurements of their magnetic properties reflect
mainly ensemble properties of single molecules.
  Their magnetic features promise a variety of applications in physics,
magneto-chemistry, biology, biomedicine and material sciences as well as in
quantum computing.
  It appears that in the majority of these molecules the localized
single-particle magnetic moments couple antiferromagnetically and the spectrum
is rather well described by the Heisenberg model with isotropic nearest
neighbor interaction sometimes augmented by anisotropy terms. Thus, the
interest in the Heisenberg model, which is known already for a long time, but
used mostly for infinite one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems, was renewed
by the successful synthesis of magnetic molecules. Studying such spin arrays
focuses on qualitatively new physics caused by the finite size of the system.
  Theoretical inorganic chemistry itself provides several methods to understand
and describe molecular magnetism. In this contribution we would like to focus
on those subjects which are of general interest in the context of quantum
magnetism.

geometrical relations existing in a square lattice and the competition between
different types of doped hole ordering. The detailed agreement between the
calculated and experimental phase diagrams is the decisive factor favoring the
mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in which superconducting pairing arises
due to scattering processes with intermediate virtual bound states of

approximation by taking the Zeeman energy due to the magnetic field $B$ into
account. In the vicinity of the QCP, we find that the AFM correlation
perpendicular to $B$ is enhanced, whereas that parallel to $B$ is reduced. This
fact means that the finite magnetic field increases $T_N$, with the AFM order
perpendicular to $B$. The increment in $T_N$ can be understood in terms of the
reduction of both quantum and thermal fluctuations due to the magnetic field,
which is caused by the self-energy effect within the FLEX approximation. The
present study naturally explains the increment in $T_N$ in CeRhIn_5 under the

Total correctness can be separated into correctness, completeness and clean
termination; the latter includes non-floundering. Only clean termination
depends on the operational semantics, in particular on the selection rule. We
show how to deal with correctness and completeness in a declarative way,
treating programs only from the logical point of view. Specifications used in
this approach are interpretations (or theories). We point out that
specifications for correctness may differ from those for completeness, as
usually there are answers which are neither considered erroneous nor required
to be computed.
  We present proof methods for correctness and completeness for definite
programs and generalize them to normal programs. For normal programs we use the
3-valued completion semantics; this is a standard semantics corresponding to
negation as finite failure. The proof methods employ solely the classical
2-valued logic. We use a 2-valued characterization of the 3-valued completion
semantics which may be of separate interest. The presented methods are compared
with an approach based on operational semantics. We also employ the ideas of
this work to generalize a known method of proving termination of normal

provides a perturbative sum that converges toward the correct answer for
positive g^2. This alternate methods amounts to introducing a specific coupling
dependent field cut, that turns the coefficients into g-dependent quantities.
Generalizing to an arbitrary field cut, we obtain a regular power series with a
finite radius of convergence. At any order in the modified perturbative
procedure, and for a given coupling, it is possible to find at least one (and
sometimes two) values of the field cut that provide the exact answer. This
optimal field cut can be determined approximately using the strong coupling
expansion. This allows us to interpolate accurately between the weak and strong

sufficiently high energies implies the phase transition to the quark--gluon

observer moving with an acceleration $a$ experiences the influence of a thermal
bath with an effective temperature $T = a / 2\pi$, similar to the one present
in the vicinity of a black hole horizon. For electric charges moving in
external electromagnetic fields of realistic strength, the resulting
temperature appears too small to be detected. However for partons in strong
color fields the effect should be observable: in the Color Glass Condensate
picture, the strength of the color-electric field is $E \sim Q_s^2/g$ ($Q_s$ is
the saturation scale, and $g$ is the strong coupling), the typical acceleration
is $a \sim Q_s$, and the heat bath temperature is $T = Q_s / 2\pi \sim 200$
MeV. In nuclear collisions at sufficiently high energies the effect can induce
a rapid thermalization over the time period of $\tau \simeq 2\pi/Q_s \simeq 1\
{\rm fm}$ accompanied by phase transitions. We consider a specific example of
chiral symmetry restoration induced by a rapid deceleration of the colliding
nuclei. We argue that parton saturation in the initial nuclear wave functions
is a necessary pre--condition for the formation of quark--gluon plasma. We
discuss the implications of our ""black hole thermalization"" scenario for
various observables in relativistic heavy ion collisions.

or ${\rm Ai_1(x)}$, is presented. For the Airy function ${\rm Ai}(z)$, as an
example, the Stokes' phenomenon is considered as a consequence of discontinuous
behavior of steepest descent lines over the passes. When $z$ crosses the Stokes
ray, the steepest descent line over the higher pass abruptly changes the
direction of its asymptotic approach to the steepest descent line over the
lower pass to the direction of approach to the opposite end of this line.
Therefore, when the integration contour, drawn along the steepest descent
lines, goes over the higher pass, it begins or stops to go over the lower pass
while $z$ crosses the Stokes ray, and as a result the recessive series
(contribution from the lower pass) discontinuously appears or disappears in the
asymptotic representation of a function containing the dominant series.

local solvability of doubly characteristic second order differential operators.
For a large class of such operators, we show that local solvability at a given

of Hoermander's classical necessary condition for local solvability, the proof
is reduced to the following question, whose answer forms the core of the paper:
  Suppose that $Q_A$ and $Q_B$ are two real quadratic forms on a finite
dimensional symplectic vector space, and let $Q_C:=\{Q_A,Q_B\}$ be given by the
Poisson bracket of $Q_A$ and $Q_B.$ Then $Q_C$ is again a quadratic form, and
we may ask: When can we find a common zero of $Q_A$ and $Q_B$ at which $Q_C$
does not vanish?

comprehensive picture of what rules local solvability of invariant second order

radio frequency Paul ion traps. The electrodes reside in a single plane on a
substrate, and the pseudopotential minimum of the trap is located above the
substrate at a distance on order of the electrodes' lateral extent or
separation. This architecture provides the possibility to apply standard
microfabrication principles to the construction of multiplexed ion traps, which
may be of particular importance in light of recent proposals for large-scale
quantum computation based on individual trapped ions.

be modeled using a generalization of monads called arrows. We express the
resulting executable model of quantum computing in the programming language
Haskell using its special syntax for arrow computations. The embedding in
Haskell is however not perfect: a faithful model of quantum computing requires
type capabilities which are not directly expressible in Haskell.

A 72, 012310 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.012310",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss a deterministic model of detector coupled to a two-level system (a
qubit). The detector is a quasi-classical object whose dynamics is described by
the kicked rotator Hamiltonian. We show that in the regime of quantum chaos the
detector acts as a chaotic bath and induces decoherence of the qubit. We
discuss the dephasing and relaxation rates and demonstrate that several
features of Ohmic baths can be reproduced by our fully deterministic model.
Moreover, we show that, for strong enough qubit-detector coupling, the
dephasing rate is given by the rate of exponential instability of the
detector's dynamics, that is, by the Lyapunov exponent of classical motion.
Finally, we discuss the measurement in the regimes of strong and weak
qubit-detector coupling. For the case of strong coupling the detector performs
a measurement of the up/down state of the qubit. In the case of weak coupling,
due to chaos, the dynamical evolution of the detector is strongly sensitive to
the state of the qubit. However, in this case it is unclear how to extract a
signal from any measurement with a coarse-graining in the phase space on a size
much larger than the Planck cell.

controllable entangled states of two three-level atoms interacting with an
optical cavity and a laser beam. Losses due to atomic spontaneous transitions
and to cavity decay are efficiently suppressed by employing fractional
adiabatic passage and appropriately designed atom-field couplings. In this
scheme the two atoms traverse the cavity-mode and the laser beam in opposite
directions as opposed to other entanglement schemes in which the atoms are
required to have fixed locations inside a cavity. We also show that the
coherence of a traveling atom can be transferred to the other one without
populating the cavity-mode.

related through the coherent state representation to the exponential generating

combinatorial methodology which is applied to boson normal ordering and
