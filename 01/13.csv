composed of 1650 spectra computed with the latest improvements in stellar

hot (Teff >= 27500 K) and LTE line-blanketed models (Phoenix) for cool (3000 K
=< Teff =< 4500 K) stars. Because of the high spectral resolution of this
library, evolutionary synthesis models can be used to predict the strength of
numerous weak absorption lines, and the evolution of the profiles of the
strongest lines over a wide range of ages. The SSP results have been calculated
for ages 1 Myr to 17 Gyr using the stellar evolutionary provided by the Geneva
and Padova-tracks groups. For young stellar populations, our results have a
very detailed coverage of high-temperature stars with similar results for
Padova and Geneva isochrones. For intermediate and old stellar populations, our
results, once degraded to a lower resolution, are similar to the ones obtained
by other groups apart from limitations imposed by the stellar evolutionary
physics. The limitations and advantages of our library for the analysis of

observed at z ~ 0, consistent with recent work -- specifically, the growth in
the bulge-dominated galaxy fraction, f_E+SO, with increasing density proceeds
less rapidly at z ~ 1 than it does at z ~ 0. At z ~ 1 and density <= 500

fraction of this magnitude occurs at densities about 5 times smaller. The
evolution in the MDR is confined to densities >= 40 galaxies/Mpc^2 and appears
to be primarily due to a deficit of S0 galaxies and an excess of Spiral+Irr
galaxies relative to the local galaxy population. The Elliptical fraction -
density relation exhibits no significant evolution between z = 1 and z = 0. We

where the simulations with cooling have baryon fractions larger than the

smaller than universal. At larger radii (r >~ r_500) the cumulative baryon
fractions in simulations with cooling are close to, while those in the

simulations with dissipation are reduced by ~20-40% at r<0.3r_vir and ~10% at
larger radii compared to the adiabatic runs, because a fraction of gas is
converted into stars. There is an indication that gas fractions within

find that the total baryon fraction within the virial radius does not evolve

star formation rate are substantial. We calculate an `expected' star formation
rate using our nuclear spectra and apply the commonly-used aperture correction
method. The expected star formation rate overestimates the global value for
early type spirals, with large scatter for all Hubble types, particularly late

15% of the C in the IGM. The preferred scenario is that VMSs in low-mass halos
provided between 15% and 60% of the C in the regime of very high redshift

fluctuations on small scales exhibit an exponential reduction of high-redshift,
non-linear structures, including a reduction in the rate of gamma ray bursts
(GRBs). Here we quantify the constraints that the detection of distant GRBs
would place on structure formation models with reduced small-scale power. We
compute the number of GRBs that could be detectable by the Swift satellite at
high redshifts (z > 6), assuming that the GRBs trace the cosmic star formation
history, which itself traces the formation of non-linear structures. We
calibrate simple models of the intrinsic luminosity function of the bursts to
the number and flux distribution of GRBs observed by the Burst And Transient
Source Experiment (BATSE). We find that a discovery of high-z GRBs would imply
strong constraints on models with reduced small-scale power. For example, a
single GRB at z > 10, or 10 GRBs at z > 5, discovered by Swift during its
scheduled two-year mission, would rule out an exponential suppression of the
power spectrum on scales below R_c=0.09 Mpc (exemplified by warm dark matter
models with a particle mass of m_x=2 keV). Models with a less sharp suppression
of small-scale power, such as those with a red tilt or a running scalar index,
n_s, are more difficult to constrain, because they are more degenerate with an
increase in the power spectrum normalization, sigma_8, and with models in which
star-formation is allowed in low-mass minihalos. We find that a tilt of \delta
n_s ~ 0.1 is difficult to detect; however, an observed rate of 1 GRB/yr at z >
12 would yield an upper limit on the running of the spectral index, alpha =
d(n_s)/d(ln k) > -0.05.

an NFW dark halo, an exponential disk, a Hernquist bulge, and a central black
hole point mass to describe the galaxy potential. We constrain the parameters
of these functions by comparing to existing surface brightness, velocity
dispersion, and rotation curve measurements of M31. Our description provides a
good fit to the observations, and agrees well with more sophisticated modeling
of M31. While in many respects the parameter set is well constrained, there is
substantial uncertainty in the outer halo potential and a near-degeneracy
between the disk and halo components, producing a large, nearly two-dimensional
allowed region in parameter space. We limit the allowed region using
theoretical expectations for the halo concentration, baryonic content, and
stellar $M/L$ ratio, finding a smaller region where the parameters are
physically plausible. Our proposed mass model for M31 has $M_{bulge} = 3.2

model of M31's potential derived in the companion paper by Geehan et al.

position between the stream and the orbit of the progenitor; this significantly
affects the best-fitting orbits. The progenitor orbits we derive have orbital
apocenter $\sim 60 \kpc$ and pericenter $\sim 3 \kpc$, though these quantities
vary somewhat with the current orbital phase of the progenitor which is as yet
unknown. Our best combined fit to the stream and galaxy properties implies a
mass within 125 kpc of M31 of $(7.4 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{11} \Msun$. Based on
its length, width, luminosity, and velocity dispersion, we conclude that the
stream originates from a progenitor satellite with mass $M_s \sim 10^9 \Msun$,
and at most modest amounts of dark matter; the estimate of $M_s$ is again
correlated with the phase of the progenitor. M31 displays a large number of
faint features in its inner halo which may be progenitors or continuations of
the stream. While the orbital fits are not constrained enough for us to
conclusively identify the progenitor, we can identify several plausible
candidates, of which a feature in the planetary nebula distribution found by
Merrett et al. is the most plausible, and rule out several others. We make
predictions for the kinematic properties of the successful candidates. These
may aid in observational identification of the progenitor object, which would
greatly constrain the allowed models of the stream.

being an ULX is too low for IMBHs distributed in galactic haloes to account for
the observed number of ULXs. Here we show that the number of ULXs can be
explained by such halo IMBHs passing through a dense molecular cloud, if Pop
III star formation is very efficient as recently suggested by the excess of the
cosmic near-infrared background radiation that cannot be accounted for by
normal galaxy populations. We calculate the luminosity function of X-ray
sources in our scenario and find that it is consistent with observed data. Our
scenario can explain that ULXs are preferentially found at outskirts of large
gas concentrations in star forming regions. A few important physical effects
are pointed out and discussed, including gas dynamical friction, radiative
efficiency of accretion flow, and radiative feedback to ambient medium. ULXs
could last for ~10^{5-6} yr to emit a total energy of ~10^{53} erg, which is
sufficient to power the ionized expanding nebulae found by optical

characterized by a nonresonant term and is evaluated for slab and
two-dimensional turbulence geometry. The calculations presented here
demonstrate that fluctuating electric fields are a key quantity for
understanding quasilinear particle drift in slab geometry. It is shown that
particle drift does not exist in unpolarized and purely magnetic slab
fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to previous models, which are
restricted to slab geometry and the field line random walk limit. The
evaluation of the general transport parameter for two-dimensional turbulence
geometry, presented here for the first time for dynamical magnetic turbulence,
results in a drift coefficient valid for a magnetic power spectrum and
turbulence decay rate varying arbitrarily in wavenumber. For a two-component,
slab/two-dimensional turbulence model, numerical calculations are presented.
The new quasilinear drift, induced by the magnetic perturbations, is compared
with a standard drift expression related to the curvature and gradient of an
unperturbed heliospheric background magnetic field. The considerations
presented here offer a solid ground and natural explanation for the hitherto
puzzling observation that drift models often describe observations much better

binary systems, searching for ``invariant loops'': closed curves that change
shape periodically as a function of binary orbital phase as the test particles
in them move under the stars' gravity. Stable invariant loops play the same
role in this periodically-varying potential as stable periodic orbits do in
stationary potentials; in particular, when dissipation is weak, gas will most
likely follow the non-intersecting loops, while nearby particle orbits librate
around them. We use this method to set bounds on the sizes of disks around the
stars, and on the gap between those and the inner edge of a possible
circumbinary disk. Gas dynamics may impose further restrictions, but our study
sets upper bounds for the size of circumstellar disks, and a lower bound for
the inner radius of a circumbinary disk. We find that circumstellar disks are
sharply reduced as the binary's eccentricity grows. Disks change in size and
shape only marginally with the binary phase, with no strong preference to
increase or decrease at any particular phase. The circumstellar disks in
particular can be quite asymmetric. We compare our results with other numerical
and theoretical results and with observations of the $\alpha$ Centauri and
L1551 systems, finding very good agreement. The calculated changes in the
shapes and crowding of the circumstellar orbits can be used to predict how the

infrared L-band spectra of AGB stars (both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich) and

oxygen-rich stars, and acetylene (C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon-rich AGB
stars. The equivalent width of acetylene is found to be high even at low
metallicity. The high C2H2 abundance can be explained with a high
carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast,
the HCN equivalent width is low: fewer than half of the extra-galactic carbon
stars show the 3.5micron HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN
equivalent width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon
elemental abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
mass, and stars with high luminosity (i.e. high initial mass) could have a high
HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-galactic and Galactic
carbon stars. None of the oxygen-rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the equivalent
widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30angstrom for LMC
metallicity. Several possible explanations are discussed. The observations
imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach mass-loss rates as high as
their Galactic counterparts, because there are more carbon atoms available and
more carbonaceous dust can be formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO
suggests less dust and lower mass-loss rates in low-metallicity oxygen-rich

the IMF-dependent relation between stellar mass-to-light ratio, M/L, and color.
The model treats halo concentration, spin parameter, and disc mass fraction as
independent log-normal random variables. Our main conclusion is that the VL and
RL zero-points and the uncorrelated residuals can only be reproduced
simultaneously if adiabatic contraction is avoided. One or the other could be
fixed by appealing to unrealistic values for M/L, halo concentration c, and
spin parameter lambda, but not all together. The small VL scatter is naturally
determined by the predicted scatter in c and in M/L, quite independent of the
large scatter in lambda. However, the RL scatter, driven by the scatter in
lambda, can be as low as observed only if sigma_lambda simeq 0.25, about half
the value predicted for CDM haloes. This may indicate that discs form in a
special subset of haloes. The VL slope is reproduced once star formation occurs
only above a threshold surface density, and the RL slope implies that the disc
mass fraction is increasing with halo mass, consistent with feedback effects. A
model that incorporates the above ingredients provides a simultaneous fit to
all the observed features. In particular, the elimination of adiabatic
contraction allows 80% disc contribution to the observed rotation velocity of
bright discs at 2.2 disc scale lengths. The lack of halo contraction may
indicate that disc formation is not as smooth as typically envisioned, but
instead may involve clumpy, cold streams.

arise primarily in their inner narrow (emission) line regions (NLRs), based on
similarities in their locations, kinematics, and physical conditions. 1) Hubble
Space Telescope observations show that nearly all Seyfert galaxies have bright,
central knots of [O III] emission in their NLRs with radii of tens of parsecs.
These sizes are consistent with most previous estimates of the distances of UV
(and X-ray) absorbers from their central continuum sources, and a recently
obtained reliable distance of ~25 pc for a UV absorber in the Seyfert 1 galaxy
NGC 3783. 2) The nuclear emission-line knots in a sample of 10 Seyfert galaxies
have velocity widths of 300 - 1100 km/s (half-width at zero intensity), similar
to the radial velocities of most UV absorbers. The highest radial velocity for
a Seyfert UV absorber to date is only -2100 km/s, which is much lower than
typical broad-line region (BLR) velocities. There is also mounting evidence
that the NLR clouds are outflowing from the nucleus, like the UV absorbers. 3)
If our hypothesis is correct, then the NLR must have a component with a high
global covering factor (Cg) of the continuum source and BLR, to match that
found from previous surveys of UV absorbers (Cg = 0.5 - 1.0). Using STIS
spectra of NGC 4151, obtained when the continuum and BLR fluxes were low, we
find evidence for optically thin gas in its nuclear emission-line knot. We are
able to match the line ratios from this gas with photoionization models that
include a component with Cg ~ 1 and an ionization parameter and hydrogen column
density that are typical of UV absorbers.

reservoir of gas. The competition arises due to the relative attraction of
stars as a function of their mass and location in the cluster.
  The low relative motions of the stars and gas in young, gas dominated
clusters results in a tidal limit to the accretion whereas in the stellar
dominated cluster cores, the high relative velocities results in Bondi-Hoyle
accretion.
  The combination of these two accretion processes produces a two power-law IMF
with $\gamma \approx -1.5$, for low-mass stars which accrue their mass in the
gas dominated regime, and a steeper, $\gamma\approx -2.5$, IMF for higher-mass
stars that form in the core of a cluster. Simulations of the fragmentation and
formation of a stellar cluster show that the final stellar masses, and IMF, are
due to competitive accretion. Competitive accretion also naturally results in a
mass segregated cluster and in a direct correlation between the richness of a
cluster and the mass of the most massive star therein. The {\sl knee} where the

A were selected in a ~7'x7' field around the radio galaxy. Spectroscopy of 40
candidate emitters resulted in the discovery of 33 emission line galaxies of
which 31 are Ly-alpha emitters with redshifts similar to that of the radio
galaxy, while the remaining two galaxies turned out to be [OII] emitters. The
Ly-alpha profiles have widths (FWHM) in the range of 120-800 km/s, with a
median of 260 km/s. Where the signal-to-noise was large enough, the Ly-alpha
profiles were found to be asymmetric, with apparent absorption troughs blueward
of the profile peaks, indicative of absorption along the line of sight of an HI
mass of at least 2x10^2 - 5x10^4 M_sun. The properties of the Ly-alpha galaxies
(faint, blue and small) are consistent with young star forming galaxies which
are still nearly dust free. The volume density of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies in
the field around MRC 0316-257 is a factor of 3.3+0.5-0.4 larger compared with
the density of field Ly-alpha emitters at that redshift. The velocity
distribution of the spectroscopically confirmed emitters has a FWHM of 1510
km/s, which is substantially smaller than the width of the narrow-band filter
(FWHM ~ 3500 km/s). The peak of the velocity distribution is located within 200
km/s of the redshift of the radio galaxy. We conclude that the confirmed
Ly-alpha emitters are members of a protocluster of galaxies at z~3.13. The size
of the protocluster is larger than 3.3x3.3 Mpc^2. The mass of this structure is
estimated to be > 3-6x10^14 M_sun and could be the progenitor of a cluster of

result in producing a close binary system. Tidal and 3-body captures in dense

stellar mergers of such close binary systems due to interactions may play an

effective spin-orbital Hamiltonian and study its low energy sector by
constructing several exact-eigenstates in the limit of vanishing Hund's
coupling. We find that orbital degrees of freedom modulate the spin-exchange
energies, release the infinite spin-degeneracy of pyrochlore structure, and
drive the system to a non-magnetic spin-singlet manifold. The latter is a
collection of spin-singlet dimers and is, however, highly degenerate with
respect of dimer orientations. This ``orientational'' degeneracy is then lifted
by a magneto-elastic interaction that optimizes the previous energy gain by
distorting the bonds in suitable directions and leading to a tetragonal phase.
In this way a valence bond crystal state is formed, through the condensation of
dimers along helical chains running around the tetragonal c-axis, as actually
observed in MgTi$_2$O$_4$. The orbitally ordered pattern in the dimerized phase
is predicted to be of ferro-type along the helices and of antiferro-type
between them. Finally, through analytical considerations as well as numerical
ab-initio simulations, we predict a possible experimental tool for the
observation of such an orbital ordering, through resonant x-ray scattering.

near the kink and the step site and an equivalently large expansion near the
least under-coordinated surface atoms. The low coordination of the atoms on the
surface affects substantially the vibrational dynamics and thermodynamics of
this system. The local vibrational density of states show a deviation from the
bulk behavior that persist down to the 10th layer resulting in a substantial
contribution of the vibrational entropy to the excess free energy amounting to
about 90 meV per unit cell at 300K.

formalizing induction over well-founded sets and monotone and iterated

logic is strongly influenced by the well-founded semantics of logic
programming. Our main result concerns the modularity properties of inductive
definitions in ID-logic. Specifically, we formulate conditions under which a
simultaneous definition $\D$ of several relations is logically equivalent to a
conjunction of smaller definitions $\D_1 \land ... \land \D_n$ with disjoint
sets of defined predicates. The difficulty of the result comes from the fact
that predicates $P_i$ and $P_j$ defined in $\D_i$ and $\D_j$, respectively, may
be mutually connected by simultaneous induction. Since logic programming and
abductive logic programming under well-founded semantics are proper fragments
of our logic, our modularity results are applicable there as well.

stage on which dynamics takes place, but is a participant: The field equation
of general relativity connects matter dynamics to the curvature of spacetime.
Curvature is responsible for gravity, carrying us beyond the Newtonian
conception of gravity that had been in place for the previous two and a half
centuries. Much research in gravitation since then has explored and clarified
the consequences of this revolution; the notion of dynamical spacetime is now
firmly established in the toolkit of modern physics. Indeed, this notion is so
well established that we may now contemplate using spacetime as a tool for
other science. One aspect of dynamical spacetime -- its radiative character,
``gravitational radiation'' -- will inaugurate entirely new techniques for
observing violent astrophysical processes. Over the next one hundred years,
much of this subject's excitement will come from learning how to exploit
spacetime as a tool for astronomy. This article is intended as a tutorial in
the basics of gravitational radiation physics.

discontinuous for small inelasticity, does not coincide with what perturbative
QCD suggests at high energy, and only occurs because these authors take a value
for $\delta_\pi(4m^2_K)$ different from what experiment indicates. If one uses
the value for $\delta_\pi(4m^2_K)$ favoured by experiment, the ensuing phase
$\delta_S$ is continuous, agrees with perturbative QCD expectations, and

landscape of vacua, where only the dimensionful parameters--the vacuum energy
and Higgs masses--are finely ""scanned"" from one vacuum to another, while
dimensionless couplings are effectively fixed. This allows us to preserve
achievements of the usual unique-vacuum approach in relating dimensionless
couplings while also accounting for the success of the anthropic approach to
the cosmological constant problem. It can also explain the proximity of the
weak scale to the geometric mean of the Planck and vacuum energy scales. We
realize this idea with field theory landscapes consisting of $N$ fields and
$2^N$ vacua, where the fractional variation of couplings is smaller than
$1/\sqrt{N}$. These lead to a variety of low-energy theories including the
Standard Model, the MSSM, and Split SUSY. This picture suggests sharp new rules
for model-building, providing the first framework in which to simultaneously
address the cosmological constant problem together with the big and little
hierarchy problems. Requiring the existence of atoms can fix ratio of the QCD
scale to the weak scale, thereby providing a possible solution to the hierarchy
problem as well as related puzzles such as the $\mu$ and doublet-triplet
splitting problems. We also present new approaches to the hierarchy problem,
where the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass to exponentially small scales is
understood by even more basic environmental requirements such as vacuum
stability and the existence of baryons. These theories predict new physics at
the TeV scale, including a dark matter candidate. The simplest theory has
weak-scale ""Higgsinos"" as the only new particles charged under the Standard
Model, with gauge coupling unification near $10^{14}$ GeV.

transformations, which renders the Planck energy observer independent. This
gives a form of deformed or doubly special relativity (DSR), previously

temperature. This unexpected behaviour is associated to an anomalous behaviour
of the entropy which becomes larger for the polarized phase than for the
unpolarized one above a certain critical density. This fact is a consequence of
the dependence of the entropy on the effective mass of the neutrons with
different third spin component and a new constraint on the parameters of the
effective Skyrme force is derived in order to avoid such a behaviour.

weak scattering potentials, with that for a free particle. This is valid for
all values of the particle's momentum, including the case of however slow
particles. All three times are also considered for a resonant tunneling. In all
the cases the main feature to distinguish our concept from others is that the
average starting point of transmitted (reflected) particles does not coincide
with that of all particles. One has to stress here that there is no such an
experiment which would give coordinates of all the three points,
simultaneously. For measuring the position of the average starting point of
transmitted particles we propose an experimental scheme based on the Larmor
precession effect.

extends the earlier proposed dense coding scheme for continuous variables
[S.L.Braunstein and H.J.Kimble, Phys.Rev.A 61, 042302 (2000)] to an essentially
multimode in space and time optical quantum communication channel. This new
scheme allows, in particular, for parallel dense coding of non-stationary
optical images. Similar to some other quantum dense coding protocols, our
scheme exploits the possibility of sending a classical message through only one
of the two entangled spatially-multimode beams, using the other one as a
reference system. We evaluate the Shannon mutual information for our protocol
and find that it is superior to the standard quantum limit. Finally, we show
how to optimize the performance of our scheme as a function of the
spatio-temporal parameters of the multimode entangled light and of the input
images.
