  The book shows the sights of Absolute Parallelism (AP), and contains useful
information on the problem of singularities, compatibility theory, homotopy
groups (also relative and k-ad), topological quasi-charge groups and their
morphisms. AP is a single (frame) field theory proposed by Einstein some 80
years ago; it embraces symmetries of both Special and General Relativity.
  The compatibility theory, if applied to the cases when the frame matrix
degenerates, gives a covariant test on singularities of solutions. This gives a
single variant (missed in Einstein-Mayer's list of compatible equations), the
unique 5D equation (nothing, nor D, can be changed), which solutions are free
of emerging singularities. SO4-symmetrical nonstationary solutions give rise to
a cosmological model (relativistic surfing; anti-Milne model in FRW framework)
with a specific reduction of the extra-dimension.
  Topological classification of localized field configurations, combinatorics
of topological quasi-charges (quanta), is discussed in an attempt to imagine
the Standard Model (and quantum theory itself; and, perhaps, to make some
qualitative predictions, like the absence of spin zero elementary quanta).

$f_2(2240)$, $f_2(2300)$ fit well the $q\bar q$ trajectories in the

its large N planar limit. The effective Hamiltonian in the closed su(2)
subsector of the model is explicitly computed through a specially tailored
computer program to perform large scale distributed symbolic algebra and
generation of planar graphs. The number of graphs here was in the deep
billions.
  The outcome of our computation establishes the four-loop integrability of the
planar plane-wave matrix model. To elucidate the integrable structure we apply
the recent technology of the perturbative asymptotic Bethe Ansatz to our model.
The resulting S-matrix turns out to be structurally similar but nevertheless
distinct to the so far considered long-range spin-chain S-matrices of
Inozemtsev, Beisert-Dippel-Staudacher and Arutyunov-Frolov-Staudacher in the
AdS/CFT context.
  In particular our result displays a breakdown of BMN scaling at the four-loop
order. That is, while there exists an appropriate identification of the matrix
theory mass parameter with the coupling constant of the N=4 superconformal
Yang-Mills theory which yields an eigth order lattice derivative for well
seperated impurities (naively implying BMN scaling) the detailed impurity
contact interactions ruin this scaling property at the four-loop order.
  Moreover we study the issue of ``wrapping'' interactions, which show up for
the first time at this loop-order through a Konishi descendant length four
operator.

simple $k$-vectors supported in single points as limits of simplicial
$k$-chains in a Banach space (much like Dirac monopoles). This subtle
difference has powerful advantages that will be explored. Through these

upon the Cartan exterior calculus. An infinite array of approximating theories

continuum or for physics. Applications include three extensions of calculus:
calculus on fractals, bilayer calculus (soap bubbles) and discrete calculus.

$T$-Galois extension for some right finite projective left bialgebroid $T$ over
some algebra $R$ if and only if it is of left depth two and left balanced.
Exchanging left and right in this statement, we have also a characterization of

equals the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents, the exponential rates of
divergence of infinitesimal perturbations. Kinetic theory may be used to
calculate the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for dilute gases of many hard disks or
spheres in equilibrium at low number density $n$. The density expansion of
$h_{\mathrm{KS}}$ is $N \bar\nu A [\ln n + B + O(n)]$, where $\bar\nu$ is the
single-particle collision frequency. Previous calculations of $A$ were
succesful. Calculations of $B$, however, were unsatisfactory. In this paper, I
show how the probability distribution of the stretching factor can be
determined from a nonlinear differential equation by an iterative method. From
this the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy follows as the average of the logarithm of
the stretching factor per unit time. I calculate approximate values of $B$ and
compare these to results from existing simulations. The agreement is good.

perpendicular pumping. Considering the associated Landau-Lifshitz spin
evolution equation with Gilbert damping together with Maxwell equation for the

variable. We identify several new fixed points for suitable choice of external
field in a rotating frame of reference. In particular, we identify explicit
equatorial and related fixed points of the spin vector in the plane transverse
to the anisotropy axis when the pumping frequency coincides with the amplitude
of the static parallel field. We then study the linear stability of these novel
fixed points under homogeneous and spin wave perturbations and obtain a
generalized Suhl's instability criterion, giving the condition for exponential
growth of P-modes under spin wave perturbations. Two parameter phase diagrams
(in terms of amplitudes of static parallel and oscillatory perpendicular
magnetic fields) for stability are obtained, which differ qualitatively from
those for the conventional ferromagnetic resonance near thermal equilibrium and
are amenable to experimental tests.

reviewed. Their relation to the nature of electric control is discussed. We
reconfirm that the calculated double layer capacitance can be negative under
S-control - an artificial construct that requires uniform distribution of the
electrode surface charge density, S. It is shown that the combined relaxation
of the ionic and electronic contributions can result in C<0 even for the local
statistical ionic models with strictly positive diffuse layer capacitance. In
reality, however, only the total charge q (or the average surface charge
density S) can be experimentally fixed in isolated cell studies (q-control).
For those S where C becomes negative under S-control, the transition to
q-control (i.e. relaxing the lateral charge density distribution, fixing its
mean value to S) leads to instability of the uniform distribution and a
transition to a non-uniform phase. As an illustration, a ""membrane capacitor""
model is discussed. This exactly solvable model, allowing for both uniform and
inhomogeneous relaxation of the electrical double layer, helps to demonstrate
both the onset and some important features of the instability. Perspectives for
further development are discussed briefly.
