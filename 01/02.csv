mechanisms in the asteroid belt. We first derive a simple kinetic model of
chaotic diffusion and show how it gives rise to some simple correlations (but
not laws) between the removal time (the time for an asteroid to experience a
qualitative change of dynamical behavior and enter a wide chaotic zone) and the
Lyapunov time. The correlations are shown to arise in two different regimes,
characterized by exponential and power-law scalings. We also show how is the
so-called ""stable chaos"" (exponential regime) related to anomalous diffusion.
Finally, we check our results numerically and discuss their possible
applications in analyzing the motion of particular asteroids.

We work in a shearing-sheet-like approximation, where the vertical structure of
the disk is neglected, and develop equations for the evolution of a plane-wave
perturbation comoving with the shear flow (a shearing wave, or ``shwave''). We
calculate a complete solution set for compressive and incompressive
short-wavelength perturbations in both the stratified and unstratified
shearing-sheet models. We develop expressions for the late-time asymptotic
evolution of an individual shwave as well as for the expectation value of the
energy for an ensemble of shwaves that are initially distributed isotropically
in k-space. We find that: (i) incompressive, short-wavelength perturbations in
the unstratified shearing sheet exhibit transient growth and asymptotic decay,
but the energy of an ensemble of such shwaves is constant with time (consistent
with Afshordi, Mukhopadhyay & Narayan 2004); (ii) short-wavelength compressive
shwaves grow asymptotically in the unstratified shearing sheet, as does the
energy of an ensemble of such shwaves; (iii) incompressive shwaves in the
stratified shearing sheet have density and azimuthal velocity perturbations
\delta \Sigma,\delta v_y ~ t^{-Ri} (for |Ri| << 1), where Ri = N_x^2/(q
\Omega)^2 is the Richardson number, N_x^2 is the square of the radial
Brunt-Vaisala frequency and q\Omega is the effective shear rate; (iv) the
energy of an ensemble of incompressive shwaves in the stratified shearing sheet
behaves asymptotically as Ri t^{1-4Ri} for |Ri| << 1. For Keplerian disks with
modest radial gradients, |Ri| is expected to be << 1, and there will therefore
be weak growth in a single shwave for Ri < 0 and near-linear growth in the
energy of an ensemble of shwaves, independent of the sign of Ri.

model without solvent to the model that includes the solute-solvent
contribution. In particular we find for appropriate choices of parameters upper
critical points, lower critical points and even closed loops with both upper
and lower critical points, similar to one found before [Macromolecules, 36,
5845 (2003)]. In the general case of systems whose interactions are not

understand the phase diagram in the presence of solvent. We also present

3D ensemble of 5X5X4=100 nanomagnets, each with spin $S = 5$. We employed the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to solve for the magnetization $M(B)$ curves
for several values of the damping constant $\alpha$, the induction sweep rate,
the lattice constant $a$, the temperature $T$, and the magnetic anisotropy
field $H_A$. We find that the smaller the $\alpha$, the stronger the maximum
induction required to produce hysteresis. The shape of the hysteresis loops
also depends on the damping constant. We find further that the system
magnetizes and demagnetizes at decreasing magnetic field strengths with
decreasing sweep rates, resulting in smaller hysteresis loops. Variations of
$a$ within realistic values (1.5 nm - 2.5 nm) show that the dipolar interaction
plays an important role in the magnetic hysteresis by controlling the
relaxation process. The $T$ dependencies of $\alpha$ and of $M$ are presented
and discussed with regard to recent experimental data on nanomagnets. $H_A$
enhances the size of the hysteresis loops for external fields parallel to the
anisotropy axis, but decreases it for perpendicular external fields. Finally,
we reproduce and test an $M(B)$ curve for a 2D-system [M. Kayali and W. Saslow,
Phys. Rev. B {\bf 70}, 174404 (2004)]. We show that its hysteretic behavior is
only weakly dependent on the shape anisotropy field and the sweep rate, but
depends sensitively upon the dipolar interactions. Although in 3D systems,
dipole-dipole interactions generally diminish the hysteresis, in 2D systems,
they strongly enhance it. For both square 2D and rectangular 3D lattices with
${\bm B}||(\hat{\bm x}+\hat{\bm y})$, dipole-dipole interactions can cause
large jumps in the magnetization.

interesting models of complex systems. While the traditional two-dimensional
Sznajd model tends to a consensus state (pro or cons), the assignment of the
contrary to the dominant opinion to some of its cells during the system
evolution is known to provide stabilizing feedback implying the overall system
state to oscillate around null magnetization. The current article presents a
novel type of geographic complex network model whose connections follow an
associated feedbacked Sznajd model, i.e. the Sznajd dynamics is run over the
network edges. Only connections not exceeding a maximum Euclidean distance $D$
are considered, and any two nodes within such a distance are randomly selected
and, in case they are connected, all network nodes which are no further than
$D$ are connected to them. In case they are not connected, all nodes within
that distance are disconnected from them. Pairs of nodes are then randomly
selected and assigned to the contrary of the dominant connectivity. The
topology of the complex networks obtained by such a simple growth scheme, which
are typically characterized by patches of connected communities, is analyzed
both at global and individual levels in terms of a set of hierarchical
measurements introduced recently. A series of interesting properties are
identified and discussed comparatively to random and scale-free models with the
same number of nodes and similar connectivity.

Stiefel manifold of orthonormal $m$-frames in $R^n$ which generalizes the
$\lam$-cosine transform on the Grassmann manifold of $m$-dimensional linear
subspaces of $R^n$. We call it the composite cosine transform, by taking into
account that its kernel agrees with the composite power function of the cone of
positive definite symmetric matrices. Our aim is to describe the set of all
$\lam \in C^m$ for which $T^\lam$ is injective on the space of integrable
functions. We obtain the precise description of this set in some important
cases, in particular, for $\lam$-cosine transforms on Grassmann manifolds. The
main tools are the classical Fourier analysis of functions of matrix argument
and the relevant zeta integrals.

in near- and fully-resonant optically-dense Doppler-broadened medium are
studied. The feasibility of overcoming of the fundamental limitation on a
velocity-interval of resonantly coupled molecules imposed by the Doppler effect
is shown based on quantum coherence. This increases the efficiency of
nonlinear-optical processes in atomic and molecular gases that possess the most
narrow and strongest resonances. The possibility of all-optical switching of
the medium to opaque or, alternatively, to absolutely transparent, or even to
strongly-amplifying states is explored, which is controlled by a small
variation of two driving radiations. The required intensities of the control
fields are shown to be typical for cw lasers. These effects are associated with
four-wave mixing accompanied by Stokes gain and by their interference in fully-
and near-resonant optically-dense far-from-degenerate double-Lambda medium.
Optimum conditions for inversionless amplification of short-wavelength
radiation above the oscillation threshold at the expense of the
longer-wavelength control fields, as well as for Raman gain of the generated
idle infrared radiation, are investigated. The outcomes are illustrated with
numerical simulations applied to sodium dimer vapor. Similar schemes can be
realized in doped solids and in fiber optics.
