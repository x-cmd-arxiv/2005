of the X-ray cavities observed in some galaxy clusters, and the optically
deficient point-symmetric bubbles occurring in some planetary nebulae (PNe).
Point-symmetric PNe are thought to be shaped by stellar binary interactions;
namely, the presence of a companion to the PN's progenitor star is required. We
suggest that similar point-symmetric structures in the X-ray cavities of galaxy
clusters might be associated with the presence of massive binary black holes. A
systematic cataloguing of high-resolution images of the diffuse X-ray emission
at the core of galaxy clusters might contribute to individuate massive binary
black holes.

containing PSR B1259-63 and the Be star SS 2883, made around the time of the
2004 periastron. This is the fourth periastron to have been observed in detail.
As in previous observations, changes in the pulsar's dispersion and rotation
measures are detected over a period spanning 200 days. We show that the eclipse
of the pulsed emission lasts from 16 days prior to periastron to 15 days after
periastron and is consistent from one periastron to the next. We demonstrate
that the timing solution proposed by Wang et al. (2004) provides a good fit
through the 2004 periastron. The light curve of the transient unpulsed radio
emission is broadly similar from one periastron to the next. For this
periastron, however, the light curve is strongly peaked post-periastron with
rather little enhancement prior to periastron, in contrast to the 2000
periastron where the peak flux densities were more equal. These observations
remain consistent with the interpretation that the pulsar passes through the
dense circumstellar disk of the Be star just before and just after periastron.
The observed differences from one periastron to the next can be ascribed to
variations in the local disk density and magnetic field structure at the time
the pulsar enters the disk.

ground-based velocity observations of this star. We also examine the claims
that the MOST observations represent the best photometric precision so far
reported in the literature by about an order of magnitude and are the most
sensitive data set for asteroseismology available for any star other than the
Sun. These statements are not correct, with the most notable exceptions being
observations of oscillations in alpha Cen A that are far superior. We further
disagree that the hump of excess power seen repeatedly from velocity
observations of Procyon can be explained as an artefact caused by gaps in the
data. The MOST observations failed to reveal oscillations clearly because their
noise level is too high, possibly from scattered Earthlight in the instrument.
We did find an excess of strong peaks in the MOST amplitude spectrum that is
inconsistent with a simple noise source such as granulation, and may perhaps
indicate oscillations at roughly the expected level.

observation made two years earlier, show no evidence for significant changes in
the pulse profile of PSR J0737-3039A, the 22-ms pulsar. The limit on variations
of the profile 10% width is about 0.5 deg per year. These results imply an
angle delta between the pulsar spin axis and the orbit normal of <~ 60 deg,
consistent with recent evolutionary studies of the system. Although a wide
range of system parameters remain consistent with the data, the model proposed
by Jenet & Ransom (2004) can be ruled out. A non-zero ellipticity for the

so that a circular beam describes the data equally well within the

consistent with either an extension of the power law to smaller radii, or a
flattened (Bonner-Ebert like) density distribtion. We can further constrain the
optical depth along the short axis at 1300um to be ~ 5e-3, the central
luminosity to be L < 1e-3 solar luminosities, the long axis diameter D ~ 0.1

Gravity (LQG) is the underlying discrete structure. In the cosmological context
elucidated by Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), this is manifested by the
Hamiltonian constraint equation being a (partial) difference equation. One
obtains an effective Hamiltonian framework by making the continuum
approximation followed by a WKB approximation. In the large volume regime,
these lead to the usual classical Einstein equation which is independent of
both the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ as well as $\hbar$. In this work we
present an alternative derivation of the effective Hamiltonian by-passing the
continuum approximation step. As a result, the effective Hamiltonian is
obtained as a close form expression in $\gamma$. These corrections to the
Einstein equation can be thought of as corrections due to the underlying
discrete (spatial) geometry with $\gamma$ controlling the size of these
corrections. These corrections imply a bound on the rate of change of the
volume of the isotropic universe. In most cases these are perturbative in
nature but for cosmological constant dominated isotropic universe, there are
significant deviations.

correlation kernel at such a critical point in a double scaling limit. The

Painleve equation. This extends a result of Bleher and Its for the special case

  The two main tools we use are equilibrium measures and Riemann-Hilbert
problems. In our treatment of equilibrium measures we allow a negative density
near the critical point, which enables us to treat all cases simultaneously.
The asymptotic analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is done with the
Deift/Zhou steepest descent analysis. For the construction of a local

function of $\omega$ and $\omega^\prime$ away from the diagonal

the singular part of the scattering amplitude (for example, in the transversal

denominator. Such structure is typical for long-range scattering. We refer to
this phenomenon as to the long-range Aharonov-Bohm effect. On the contrary, for
$d=3$ scattering is essentially of short-range nature although, for example,
the magnetic potential $A^{(tr)}(x)$ such that ${\rm curl} A^{(tr)}(x)=B(x)$

precise, we show that, up to the diagonal Dirac function (times an explicit

requires a final step that is needed after using a theory of diffraction such
as the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchhoff. Introduced here, the final
step accounts for interference between adjacent apertures on a phase screen by
adaptively adjusting their phase and amplitude, yielding a hierarchy of energy
contributions to any desired window of signal travel time at the receiver. The
method allows one to check errors in ray theory at finite wavelengths. Acoustic
propagation at long distance in the oceanic waveguide (50-100 Hz, 0.05 s
resolution) has significant deviations from ray theory. The boundary condition
of zero pressure at the surface of the ocean appears to cause sound to travel
in a nearly horizontal trajectory for a much greater distance near the surface
than predicted by rays. The first Fresnel zone is an inappropriate scale to
characterize where transient sounds travel near a ray path as assumed by a
standard scattering theory. Instead, the Fresnel zone is too large by an order
of magnitude for cases investigated here. Regions where sounds travel can have
complicated structures defying a simple length scale. These results are
applicable to the physics of underwater sound, optics, radio communication,
radar, geophysics, and theories of wave-scattering.

the belief that the same top-down investigative approach that proved successful
in other biological problems (e.g. DNA sequencing) will be as effective when it
comes to inferring more complex intracellular processes. The results in this
paper address this fundamental issue in the specific context of transcription
regulatory networks. Although simple recurring regulatory motifs have been
identified in the past, due to the size and complexity of the connectivity
structure, the subdivision of such networks into larger, and possibly
inter-connected, regulatory modules is still under investigation. Specifically,
it is unclear whether functionally well-characterized transcriptional
sub-networks can be identified by solely analyzing the connectivity structure
of the overall network topology. In this paper, we show that transcriptional
regulatory networks can be systematically partitioned into communities whose
members are consistently functionally related. We applied the partitioning
method to the transcriptional regulatory networks of the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae; the resulting communities of gene and transcriptional regulators
can be associated to distinct functional units, such as amino acid metabolism,
cell cycle regulation, protein biosynthesis and localization, DNA replication
and maintenance, lipid catabolism, stress response and so on. Moreover, the
observation of inter-community connectivity patterns provides a valuable tool
for elucidating the inter-dependency between the discovered regulatory modules.

within an isolated, closed system composed of non-interacting identical
particles with energy levels e_i with i=1,2,...,N. The time-dependent
occupation probabilities p_i(t) are assumed to obey the nonlinear rate
equations tau dp_i/dt=-p_i ln p_i+ alpha(t)p_i-beta(t)e_ip_i where alpha(t) and
beta(t) are functionals of the p_i(t)'s that maintain invariant the mean energy
E=sum_i e_ip_i(t) and the normalization condition 1=sum_i p_i(t). The entropy
S(t)=-k sum_i p_i(t) ln p_i(t) is a non-decreasing function of time until the
initially nonzero occupation probabilities reach a Boltzmann-like canonical
distribution over the occupied energy eigenstates. Initially zero occupation
probabilities, instead, remain zero at all times. The solutions p_i(t) of the
rate equations are unique and well-defined for arbitrary initial conditions
p_i(0) and for all times. Existence and uniqueness both forward and backward in
time allows the reconstruction of the primordial lowest entropy state. The time
evolution is at all times along the local direction of steepest entropy ascent
