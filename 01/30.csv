  and Supernova Remnants' edited by C. Rakowski and S. Chatterjee. 11 pages,
  AdSpR emulate style",,"10.1016/j.asr.2005.01.097",,"astro-ph",,"  In this review I discuss the various gamma-ray emission lines that are
expected and have been observed from radioactive explosive nucleosynthesis
products. The most important gamma-ray lines result from the decay chains of
Ni-56, Ni-57, and Ti-44. Ni-56 is the prime explosive nucleosynthesis product
of Type Ia supernovae, but Ni-56 is also a product of core-collapse supernovae.
Gamma-ray line emission from its daughter product, Co-56, has been detected
from SN1987A. The early occurrence of this emission indicates that some
fraction of Ni-56, which is synthesized in the innermost supernova layers, must
have mixed with the outermost ejecta.
  Special attention is given to the gamma-ray line emission of the decay chain
of Ti-44, giving line emission at 68 keV, 78 keV, and 1157keV. Given its decay
time of 86 yr, one expects this line emission from young supernova remnants.
The Ti-44 production is very sensitive to the explosion properties This makes
Ti-44 an ideal tool to study the inner layers of the supernova explosion.
  The gamma-ray line emission from Ti-44 has so far only been detected from the
supernova remnant Cas A. I discuss these detections, which were made by COMPTEL
and BeppoSAX, which suggest a Ti-44 yield of (1.5+/-1.0)x10^{-4} Msun.
Moreover, I present some preliminary results of Cas A observations by INTEGRAL,
which has yielded a 3sigma detection of the 68 keV line with the ISGRI
instrument at a level consistent with the BeppoSAX results. A preliminary
analysis of the vailable INTEGRAL-SPI data indicates that narrow line emission
(Delta v < 1000 km/s) can be almost excluded at the 2sigma level. (Abridged)

maps represent local extinction enhancements and ignore any contribution from
the ISM or very large clouds. Data reduction was performed on a Beowulf-type
cluster (in approximately 120 hours). Such a cluster is ideal for this type of
work as areas of the sky can be independently processed in parallel. We studied
how extinction depends on wavelength in all of the high extinction regions
detected and within selected dark clouds. On average a power law opacity index
(\beta) of 1.0 to 1.8 in the NIR was deduced. The index however differed
significantly from region to region and even within individual dark clouds.
That said, generally it was found to be constant, or to increase, with
wavelength within a particular region.

a large fraction of the speed of sound in a Type Ia supernova. We present a
three-dimensional numerical simulation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable carbon
flame, following its evolution through the transition to turbulence. A low Mach
number hydrodynamics method is used, freeing us from the harsh timestep
restrictions imposed by sound waves. We fully resolve the thermal structure of
the flame and its reaction zone, eliminating the need for a flame model. A
single density is considered, $1.5\times 10^7 \gcc$, and half carbon\slash half
oxygen fuel--conditions under which the flame propagated in the flamelet regime
in our related two-dimensional study. We compare to a corresponding
two-dimensional simulation, and show that while fire-polishing keeps the small
features suppressed in two dimensions, turbulence wrinkles the flame on far
smaller scales in the three-dimensional case, suggesting that the transition to
the distributed burning regime occurs at higher densities in three dimensions.
Detailed turbulence diagnostics are provided. We show that the turbulence
follows a Kolmogorov spectrum and is highly anisotropic on the large scales,
with a much larger integral scale in the direction of gravity. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that it becomes more isotropic as it cascades down to small scales.
Based on the turbulent statistics and the flame properties of our simulation,
we compute the Gibson scale. We show the progress of the turbulent flame
through a classic combustion regime diagram, indicating that the flame just
enters the distributed burning regime near the end of our simulation.

We compare their properties from the infrared to the optical and examine
various correlations among the black hole mass, accretion rate, star formation
rate and optical and infrared luminosities. We find that the infrared excess in
IR QSOs is mostly in the far infrared, and their infrared spectral indices
suggest that the excess emission is from low temperature dust heated by
starbursts rather than AGNs. The infrared excess is therefore a useful
criterion to separate the relative contributions of starbursts and AGNs. We
further find a tight correlation between the star formation rate and the
accretion rate of central AGNs for IR QSOs. The ratio of the star formation
rate and the accretion rate is about several hundred for IR QSOs, but decreases
with the central black hole mass. This shows that the tight correlation between
the stellar mass and the central black hole mass is preserved in massive
starbursts during violent mergers. We suggest that the higher Eddington ratios
of NLS1s and IR QSOs imply that they are in the early stage of evolution toward
classical Seyfert 1's and QSOs, respectively.

Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in the mean-field approximation, we derive the
spectra both for the normal and color-flavor locked (CFL) superfluid phases at
zero temperature. In the normal phase, we obtain zero sound as a low-lying
collective mode in the particle-hole (vector) channel. In the CFL phase, when
the excitation energy, $\omega$, is smaller than the threshold given by twice
the pairing gap $\Delta$ ($\omega<2\Delta$), a phonon corresponding to
fluctuations in the U(1) phase of $\Delta$ appears as a sharp peak in the
particle-particle ($H$) channel. We reproduce the property known from low
energy effective theories that this mode propagates at a velocity of
$v_H=1/\sqrt{3}$ in the low momentum regime; the decay constant $f_H$ in the
NJL model is identical with the QCD result in the mean-field approximation. We
also find that as the momentum of the phonon increases, the excitation energy
goes up and asymptotically approaches $\omega=2\Delta$. Above the threshold for
pair excitations ($\omega>2\Delta$), zero sound manifests itself in the vector
channel. By locating the zero sound pole of the vector propagator in the
complex energy plane we investigate the attenuation and energy dispersion
relation of zero sound. In the long wavelength limit, the phonon mode has its
spectral weight in the $H$ channel alone, while the spectral function vanishes
in the vector channel. We finally extend our study to the case of nonzero
temperature.

between the Poisson sigma model on a manifold with a D-brane and the Poisson
sigma model on a supermanifold without branes (or, more properly, with a brane
which extends over the whole supermanifold).

  State University, April 1994",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Consider the scenario, in which human civilization undergoes periodic eras of
progression and regression, and consequently, changes in cosmological knowledge
are cyclic. There exist solutions of general theory of relativity, such as the
G\""{o}del universe, in which the cosmos is rotating. If the real universe is
indeed rotating, than this would be a reversion to rotating universe models,
used in ancient cosmological models. We argue that such reversions in physical
models would be inevitable in a space-time in which time is having $S^1$
(circular) topology.

"physics/0501153","Philippe Brunet","N. Le Grand, P. Brunet, L. Lebon and L. Limat","Propagative waves pattern in a falling liquid curtain","Submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  We have preformed experiments on a liquid curtain falling from a horizontal,
wetted, tube and lateraly constrained by two vertical wires. The fluid motion
nearly reduces to a free-fall, with a very low detachment velocity below the
tube. Thus, the curtain contains a large subsonic area, i.e. a domain where the
sinuous waves travel faster than the fluid. The upper boundary not being
constrained in the transverse direction, we have observed the appearance of an
up to now unreported instability when the flow rate is progressively reduced:
the top of the curtain enters a pendulum-like motion, coupled to a propagative
pattern of curtain undulations, structured as a chessboard. Measurements of the
phase velocity and frequency of this pattern are reported. Data are in
agreement with a simple dimensional argument suggesting that the wave velocity
is proportional to the surface tension divided by the mass flux of liquid per
unit length. This scaling is also that followed by the fluid velocity at the
transonic point, i.e. the point where the fluid velocity equals that of sinuous
waves. We finally discuss implications of these results on the global stability
of falling curtains.

in secure data rate and transmission distance because of the presence of
multi-photon events and loss in transmission line. Two-photon events in a
coherent state can be taken out by a two-photon interference scheme. We
investigate the security issue of utilizing this modified coherent state in
quantum cryptography. A 4 dB improvement in secure data rate or a nearly
two-fold increase in transmission distance over the coherent state are found.
With a recently proposed and improved encoding strategy, further improvement is
possible.

"quant-ph/0501176","Daowen Qiu","Daowen Qiu","Simulations of Quantum Turing Machines by Quantum Multi-Stack Machines","25 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  As was well known, in classical computation, Turing machines, circuits,
multi-stack machines, and multi-counter machines are equivalent, that is, they
can simulate each other in polynomial time. In quantum computation, Yao [11]
first proved that for any quantum Turing machines $M$, there exists quantum
Boolean circuit $(n,t)$-simulating $M$, where $n$ denotes the length of input
strings, and $t$ is the number of move steps before machine stopping. However,
the simulations of quantum Turing machines by quantum multi-stack machines and
quantum multi-counter machines have not been considered, and quantum
multi-stack machines have not been established, either. Though quantum counter
machines were dealt with by Kravtsev [6] and Yamasaki {\it et al.} [10], in
which the machines count with $0,\pm 1$ only, we sense that it is difficult to
simulate quantum Turing machines in terms of this fashion of quantum computing
devices, and we therefore prove that the quantum multi-counter machines allowed
to count with $0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm n$ for some $n>1$ can efficiently simulate
quantum Turing machines.
  Therefore, our mail goals are to establish quantum multi-stack machines and
quantum multi-counter machines with counts $0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm n$ and $n>1$,
and particularly to simulate quantum Turing machines by these quantum computing
devices.
