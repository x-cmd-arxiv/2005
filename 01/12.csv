Variable SDSS J210014.12+004446.0 (hereafter SDSS J2100). We obtained
photometry and spectroscopy in both outburst and quiescent states, providing
the first quiescent spectrum of this source. In both states, non-sinusoidal
photometric modulations are apparent, suggestive of superhumps, placing SDSS
J2100 in the SU UMa subclass of dwarf novae. However, the periods during
outburst and quiescence differ significantly, being 2.099 plus or minus 0.002
hr and 1.96 plus or minus 0.02 hr respectively. Our phase-resolved spectroscopy
during outburst yielded an estimate of about 2 hr for the orbital period,
consistent with the photometry. The presence of the shorter period modulation
at quiescence is unusual, but not unique. Another atypical feature is the
relative weakness of the Balmer emission lines in quiescence. Overall, we find
a close similarity between SDSS J2100 and the well-studied superhump
cataclysmic Variable V503 Cygni. By analogy, we suggest that the quiescent
modulation is due to a tilted accretion disk -- producing negative superhumps
-- and the modulation in outburst is due to positive superhumps from the
precession of an elliptical disk.

from a nu_2 = (3/2) nu_1 relation. To check whether, although not following the
the 3/2 relation, the QPO frequencies cluster around a region where nu_2/nu_1 ~
3/2, we re-analyzed the Sco X-1 data that were used to report that ratio and
show that, because the distribution of ratios of linearly correlated
measurements is intrinsically biased, although the significance of the
clustering around nu_2/nu_1 ~ 3/2 previously reported in the case of Sco X-1 is
formally correct, it does not provide any useful information about a possible
underlying resonance mechanism in this source. Using the same data, we then
show that the (unbiased) distribution of QPO frequencies is consistent with a
uniform distribution at a 2.4 sigma level. To investigate this further, we
analyzed a larger data set of Sco X-1 and four other sources, 4U 1608-52, 4U
1636-53, 4U 1728-34 and 4U 1820-30. We find that for all five sources the
distribution of the kHz QPO frequencies is not uniform and has multiple peaks,
which have no analogy in the distribution of points in the spectral color-color
diagrams of these sources. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple random walk of
the QPO frequencies can reproduce qualitatively the observed distributions in
frequency and frequency ratio. This result weakens the support for resonance
models of kHz QPOs in neutron stars.

the halo. This exchange determines the strength of the bar, the decrease of its
pattern speed, as well as its morphology. If the galaxy has also a gaseous
component and/or a companion or satellite, then these also take part in the
angular momentum exchange. During the evolution a bar structure forms in the
inner parts of the halo as well. This bar is shorter and fatter than the disc
bar and stays so all through the simulation, although its length grows
considerably with time. Viewed edge-on, the bar in the disc component acquires
a boxy or peanut shape. I describe the families of periodic orbits that explain
such structures and review the observations showing that boxy/peanut `bulges'

calculations of small patches of disk are used. Modes with wavelengths shorter
than the gas pressure scale height grow faster than the orbital frequency in
the surface layers. The fastest growth rate observed is five times the orbital
frequency and occurs on nearly-vertical magnetic fields. The spectrum of linear
modes agrees with a WKB analysis indicating still faster growth at unresolved
scales, with a maximum proportional to the gravity and inversely proportional
to the gas sound speed. Disturbances reaching non-linear amplitudes steepen
into trains of shocks similar to a 1-D periodic non-linear analytic solution.
Variations in propagation speed result in merging of adjacent fronts, and over
time the shock spacing and amplitude increase. Growth is limited by the
strength of the field, and the structure is disrupted when the ram pressure
exceeds the magnetic pressure. The largest horizontal density variations are
similar to the ratio of magnetic to gas pressure, and in our calculations are
more than 100. Under the conditions considered, radiation diffuses through the
inhomogeneneous flow 5x faster than through the initial hydrostatic
equilibrium, and the net cooling rate is several times greater than in a
similar calculation without magnetic fields showing the effects of convection.

apply this test to the galaxy-galaxy lensing analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky

signal to noise and has the additional advantage of spectroscopic redshifts for
lenses. This allows one to perform meaningful geometric tests of systematics
for different subsamples of galaxies at different mean redshifts, such as
brighter galaxies, fainter galaxies and high-redshift luminous red galaxies,

objects between SDSS and the DEEP2 and 2SLAQ spectroscopic surveys to establish
accurate calibration of photometric redshifts and to determine the redshift
distributions for SDSS. We use these redshift results to compute the projected
surface density contrast DeltaSigma around 259 609 spectroscopic galaxies in

consistency of the results at the 10 per cent level (1-sigma). We also use the

causing the gradual orbital decay of stellar trajectories, while setting some
stars on highly elliptic orbits. We evolve model orbits that undergo repetitive
transitions across the disc over the period of ~10^7 years. We assume that the
disc mass is small compared to the central black hole, and its gravitational
field comparatively weak, yet non-zero, and we set the present values of
orbital parameters of the model star consistent with those reported for the S2
star in Sagittarius A*. We show how a model trajectory decays and circularizes,
but at some point the mean eccentricity is substantially increased by Kozai's
resonance. In consequence the orbital decay of highly eccentric orbits is
accelerated. A combination of an axially symmetric gravitational field and
dissipative environment can provide a mechanism explaining the origin of stars
on highly eccentric orbits tightly bound to the central black hole. In the
context of other S-stars, we can conclude that an acceptable mass of the disc
(i.e., M_d<=1 percent of the black hole mass) is compatible with their
surprisingly young age and small pericentre distances, provided these stars

face-on surface brightness and contains seven spirals with either a boxy- or
peanut-shaped bulge. Dynamical models of the stellar discs are constructed
using the disc structure from $I$-band surface photometry and rotation curves
observed in the gas. The differences in the line-of-sight stellar kinematics
between the models and absorption line spectroscopy are minimized using a
least-squares approach. The modeling constrains the disc surface density and
stellar radial velocity dispersion at a fiducial radius through the free
parameter $\sqrt{M/L}$ $(\sigma_{\rm z}/\sigma_{\rm R})^{-1}$, where
$\sigma_{\rm z}/\sigma_{\rm R}$ is the ratio of vertical and radial velocity
dispersion and $M/L$ the disc mass-to-light ratio. For thirteen spirals a
transparent model provides a good match to the mean line-of-sight stellar
velocity dispersion. Models that include a realistic radiative transfer
prescription confirm that the effect of dust on the observable stellar
kinematics is small at the observed slit positions. We discuss possible sources
of systematic error and conclude that most of these are likely to be small. The
exception is the neglect of the dark halo gravity, which has probably caused an
overestimate of the surface density in the case of low surface brightness

to identify the most important contributors to the UV continuous opacity: H,
H$^{-}$, C I, and Si II. Our analysis also assumes that Vega is spherically
symmetric and its atmosphere is well described with the plane parallel
approximation. Comparing observations and computed fluxes we have been able to
discriminate between two different flux scales that have been proposed, the
IUE-INES and the HST scales, favoring the latter. The effective temperature and
angular diameter derived from the analysis of observed optical and near-UV
spectra are in very good agreement with previous determinations based on
different techniques. The silicon abundance is poorly constrained by the UV
observations of the continuum and strong lines, but the situation is more
favorable for carbon and the abundances inferred from the UV continuum and
optical absorption lines are in good agreement. Some spectral intervals in the
UV spectrum of Vega that the calculations do not reproduce well are likely
affected by deviations from LTE, but we conclude that our understanding of UV
atmospheric opacities is fairly complete for early A-type stars.

persistent LMXBs in the 1e-8 - 1e-1 Hz frequency range, aiming to detect
features in their power density spectra (PDS) associated with the viscous time
scale of the accretion disk tvisc. As this is the longest intrinsic time scale
of the disk, the power density of its Mdot variations is expected to be
independent on the frequency at f<1/tvisc. Indeed, in the PDS of 11 sources out
of 12 we found very low frequency break, below which the spectra are nearly
flat. At higher frequencies they approximately follow the Pnu ~ nu^{-1.3} law.
  The break frequency correlates very well with the binary orbital frequency in
a broad range of binary periods Porb ~ 12 min - 33.5 days, in accord with
theoretical expectations for the viscous time scale of the disk. However, the
value of fbreak/forb is at least by an order of magnitude larger than predicted
by the standard disk theory. This suggests that a significant fraction of the
accretion Mdot occurs through the optically thin and hot coronal flow with the
aspect ratio of H/R>0.1 The predicted parameters of this flow, T ~ 1e4-1e6 K
and Ne ~ 1e12-1e15 cm^-3, are in qualitative agreement with recent Chandra and
XMM-Newton observations of complex absorption/emission features in the spectra

that the level of accuracy of the reconstruction of the nonlinear displacement

particular, it captures in a nontrivial way the nonlinear contribution from
gravitational instability, well beyond the Zel'dovich approximation. This is
also confirmed by our analyses of the non-Gaussian samples. Applying the
spherical collapse model to the probability distribution function of the
divergence of the displacement field, we also show that from a
well-reconstructed displacement field, such as that given by MAK, it is
possible to accurately disentangle dynamical contributions induced by
gravitational clustering from possible initial non-Gaussianities, allowing one
to efficiently test the non-Gaussian nature of the primordial fluctuations. In
addition, a simple application of MAK using the Zel'dovich approximation allows
one to also recover accurately the present-day peculiar velocity field on

aim of this work to demonstrate the usefulness of universal scaling functions
for the analysis of non-equilibrium phase transitions. In order to limit the
coverage of this article, we focus on a particular class of non-equilibrium
critical phenomena, the so-called absorbing phase transitions. These phase
transitions arise from a competition of opposing processes, usually creation
and annihilation processes. The transition point separates an active phase and
an absorbing phase in which the dynamics is frozen. A systematic analysis of
universal scaling functions of absorbing phase transitions is presented,
including static, dynamical, and finite-size scaling measurements. As a result
a picture gallery of universal scaling functions is presented which allows to

a self dual (or anti-self dual) teleparallel gravity in which, due to the fact
that it does not contribute to the interaction of fermions with gravitation,

statistically significant enhancements in the \eta(1440) mass region. These
enhancements have large transverse momentum which rules them out as being due
to pseudoscalar resonances but is consistent with the production of
axial-vector mesons. We use tagged two-photon events to study the properties of
the observed enhancements and associate them with the production of f_1(1285)

two standard deviations with the first observation of this resonance in

the allowed couplings of charged hypermultiplets in the lowest dimensional reps
of the gauge groups SU(5), SO(10) and E(6). Our results are within the
classification of homogeneous quaternionic scalar manifolds. In the minimal
coupling of a generation of bulk matter hypermultiplets, supergravity requires
the field content of an SO(10) scenario. In the minimal coupling of $n$ bulk
generations of matter and higgs hypermultiplets, supergravity requires the
field content of an E(6) scenario.
  We also discuss the coupling of tensors and non-compact gaugings in 5D
YMESGTs, which can serve as alternative ways to obtain four-dimensional Higgs
sectors. Charged tensor couplings seem to be difficult to work with
phenomenologically since a U(1) gauge factor is always required when they are
present, and it is not clear if tensors can be put in unified multiplets with
other fields, if this is desired. This seems to imply that tensor coulpings in
GUT scenarios may be better suited in higher dimensional settings. The
non-compact gaugings discussed here are simple, and offer a novel unification
scenario in which the supergravity and vector multiplets are connected by gauge
transformations.

discussion is in the spirit of a ""bottom-up"" approach, M-theory is taken as a

there are two different prescriptions. They are given by the exact process
where the gluons couple via top-quark loops to the Higgs boson and by the

latter case the coupling of the gluons to the Higgs boson is described by an
effective Lagrangian. Both prescriptions have been used for the $2 \to 2$ body
reactions to make predictions for Higgs boson production at hadron colliders.
In next-to-leading order only the effective Lagrangian approach has been used
to compute the single particle inclusive distributions. The exact computation
of the latter has not been done yet because the n-dimensional extensions of $2

still missing. To remedy this we replace wherever possible the Born cross
sections in the asymptotic top-quark mass limit by their exact analogues. These
cross sections appear in the soft and virtual gluon contributions to the
next-to-leading order distributions. This approximation is inspired by the fact
that soft-plus-virtual gluons constitute the bulk of the higher order
correction. Deviations from the asymptotic top-quark mass limit are discussed.

cohomology of open strings with both ends on the same GC brane. In mathematical
terms, we determine spaces of endomorphisms in the category of GC branes. We
find that the BRST cohomology can be expressed as the cohomology of a Lie
algebroid canonically associated to any GC brane. In the special case of
B-branes, this leads to an apparently new way to compute Ext groups of
holomorphic line bundles supported on complex submanifolds: while the usual
method leads to a spectral sequence converging to the Ext, our approach
expresses the Ext group as the cohomology of a certain differential acting on
the space of smooth sections of a graded vector bundle on the submanifold. In
the case of coisotropic A-branes, our computation confirms a proposal of D.

of the homogeneous component of the inflaton field and the resulting process of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in the simplest models of new inflation usually
occurs almost instantly: for the new inflation on the GUT scale it takes only
about 5 oscillations of the field distribution. The decay of the homogeneous
inflaton field is so efficient because of a combined effect of tachyonic
preheating and parametric resonance. At that stage, the homogeneous oscillating
inflaton field decays into a collection of waves of the inflaton field, with a
typical wavelength of the order of the inverse inflaton mass. This stage
usually is followed by a long stage of decay of the inflaton field into other
particles, which can be described by the perturbative approach to reheating
after inflation. The resulting reheating temperature typically is rather low.

support is a 2-plane containing the ray. Throwing the particle with a given
initial impulsion defines a projective trajectory. It is a curve in the space
of rays S(V), together with an impulsion attached to each ray. In the simplest
example where the force is identically zero, the curve is a straight line and
the impulsion a constant bivector. A striking feature of projective dynamics
appears: the trajectories are not parameterized.
  Among the projective force fields corresponding to a central force, the one
defining the Kepler problem is simpler than those corresponding to other
homogeneities. Here the thrown ray describes a quadratic cone whose section by
a hyperplane corresponds to a Keplerian conic. An original point of view on the
hidden symmetries of the Kepler problem emerges, and clarifies some remarks due
to Halphen and Appell. We also get the unexpected conclusion that there exists
a notion of divergence-free field of projective forces if and only if dim V=4.

exist prediction methods for secondary structure and contact number from amino

regression-based method to predict RWCO from amino acid sequence, and analyze
the regression parameters to identify the properties that correlates with the
RWCO. The present method achieves the significant correlation of 0.59 between
the native and predicted RWCOs on average. An unusual feature of the RWCO
prediction is the remarkably large optimal half window size of 26 residues. The
regression parameters for the central and near-central residues of the local

hidden subgroup problem. Specifically, we show that the hidden subgroup problem
over the symmetric group cannot be efficiently solved by strong Fourier
sampling, even if one may perform an arbitrary POVM on the coset state. Our

"quant-ph/0501057","Sophie Laplante","Sophie Laplante, Troy Lee, Mario Szegedy","The quantum adversary method and classical formula size lower bounds","Appears in Conference on Computational Complexity 2005",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We introduce two new complexity measures for Boolean functions, or more
generally for functions of the form f:S->T. We call these measures sumPI and
maxPI. The quantity sumPI has been emerging through a line of research on
quantum query complexity lower bounds via the so-called quantum adversary
method [Amb02, Amb03, BSS03, Zha04, LM04], culminating in [SS04] with the
realization that these many different formulations are in fact equivalent.
Given that sumPI turns out to be such a robust invariant of a function, we
begin to investigate this quantity in its own right and see that it also has
applications to classical complexity theory.
  As a surprising application we show that sumPI^2(f) is a lower bound on the
formula size, and even, up to a constant multiplicative factor, the
probabilistic formula size of f. We show that several formula size lower bounds
in the literature, specifically Khrapchenko and its extensions [Khr71, Kou93],
including a key lemma of [Has98], are in fact special cases of our method.
  The second quantity we introduce, maxPI(f), is always at least as large as
sumPI(f), and is derived from sumPI in such a way that maxPI^2(f) remains a
lower bound on formula size. While sumPI(f) is always a lower bound on the
quantum query complexity of f, this is not the case in general for maxPI(f). A
strong advantage of sumPI(f) is that it has both primal and dual
characterizations, and thus it is relatively easy to give both upper and lower
bounds on the sumPI complexity of functions. To demonstrate this, we look at a
few concrete examples, for three functions: recursive majority of three, a
function defined by Ambainis, and the collision problem.

  exchange of information between its parts","6 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.71.042109",,"quant-ph",,"  We study an influence of the continuous measurement in a composite quantum
system C on the evolution of the states of its parts. It is shown that the
character of the evolution (decoherence or recoherence) depends on the type of
the measured quantity and on the initial state of the system. A number of
conditions under which the states of the subsystems of C decohere during the
measuring process are established. We propose a model of the composite system
and specify the observable the measurement of which may result in the
recoherence of the state of one of the subsystems of C. In the framework of
this model we find the optimal regime for the exchange of information between
the parts of C during the measurement. The main characteristics of such a
process are computed. We propose a scheme of detection of the recoherence under
the measurement in a concrete physical experiment.

Kelvin range can be created by laser excitation of an ultra-cold laser cooled
atomic cloud. The dynamical behavior of the electrons is similar to the one
described by conventional models of stars clusters dynamics. The single mass
component, the spherical symmetry and no stars evolution are here accurate
assumptions. The analog of binary stars formations in the cluster case is
three-body recombination in Rydberg atoms in the plasma case with the same
Heggie's law: soft binaries get softer and hard binaries get harder. We
demonstrate that the evolution of such an ultracold plasma is dominated by
Fokker-Planck kinetics equations formally identical to the ones controlling the
evolution of a stars cluster. The Virial theorem leads to a link between the
plasma temperature and the ions and electrons numbers. The Fokker-Planck
equation is approximate using gaseous and fluid models. We found that the
electrons are in a Kramers-Michie-King's type quasi-equilibrium distribution as
stars in clusters. Knowing the electron distribution and using forced fast
electron extraction we are able to determine the plasma temperature knowing the
trapping potential depth.

minimal, i.e. involve a single additional probe qubit, and optimal, i.e.
provide the maximum information adding the minimum amount of noise. Information
gain and state disturbance are quantified by fidelities which, for our schemes,
saturate the ultimate bound imposed by quantum mechanics for randomly
distributed signals. Special classes of signals are also investigated, in order
to improve the information-disturbance trade-off. Extension to higher
dimensional signals (qudits) is straightforward.
