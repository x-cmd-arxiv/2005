determine molecular abundances as functions of position in pre- and
protostellar cores. The data require a ""drop"" abundance profile with radius,
with high abundances in the outermost regions probed by low excitation 3 mm
lines, and much lower abundances at intermediate zones probed by higher
frequency lines. The results are illustrated by detailed analysis of CO and
HCO+ lines for a subset of objects. We propose a scenario in which the
molecules are frozen out in a region of the envelope where the temperature is
low enough (<= 40 K) to prevent immediate desorption, but where the density is
high enough (> 10^4-10^5 cm^{-3}) that the freeze-out timescales are shorter
than the lifetime of the core. The size of the freeze-out zone is thereby a
record of the thermal and dynamical evolution of the cores. Fits to CO data for
a sample of 16 objects indicate that the size of the freeze-out zone decreases
significantly between Class 0 and I objects, explaining the variations in, for
example, CO abundances with envelope masses. However, the corresponding
timescales are 10^{5+/-0.5} years, with no significant difference between Class
0 and I objects. These timescales suggest that the dense pre-stellar phase with
heavy depletions lasts only a short time, of order 10^5 yr, in agreement with
recent chemical-dynamical models.

the Palomar 5 meter telescope. On two nights, we observed quasi-periodic
infrared flares from GRS 1915+105, each accompanied by a set of fast
oscillations in the X-ray light curve (indicating an interaction between the
jet and accretion disk). In contrast to similar observations in 1997, we find
that the duration of each X-ray cycle matches the duration of its accompanying
infrared flare, and we observed one instance in which an isolated X-ray
oscillation occurred at the same time as a faint infrared ""subflare"" (of
duration ~ 150 seconds) superimposed on one of the main flares. From these
data, we are able to conclude that each X-ray oscillation had an associated
faint infrared flare and that these flares blend together to form, and entirely
comprise, the ~ 30 minute events we observed. Part of the infrared emission in
1997 also appears to be due to superimposed small flares, but it was
overshadowed by infrared-bright ejections associated with the appearance of a
sharp ""trigger"" spike in each X-ray cycle that were not present in 2002. We
also study the evolution of the X-ray spectrum and find significant differences
in the high energy power law component, which was strongly variable in 1997 but
not in 2002. Taken together, these observations reveal the diversity of ways in
which the accretion disk and jet in black hole systems are capable of
interacting and solidify the importance of the trigger spike for large
ejections to occur on ~ 30 minute timescales in GRS 1915+105.

NGC 1569 (Galliano et al., 2003), synthesizing both the global stellar
radiation field and the dust emission, with further constraints provided by the
photoionisation of the gas. Our study shows that low-metallicity galaxies have
very different dust properties compared to the Galaxy.
  Our main results are: (i) a paucity of PAHs which are likely destroyed by the
hard penetrating radiation field, (ii) a very small (3-4 nm) average size of
grains, consistent with the fragmentation and erosion of dust particles by the
numerous shocks, (iii) a significant millimetre excess in the dust spectral
energy distribution which can be explained by the presence of ubiquitous very
cold dust (T=5-9 K) accounting for 40 to 80 % of the total dust mass, probably
distributed in small clumps. We derive a range of gas-to-dust mass ratios
between 300 and 2000, larger than the Galactic values and dust-to-metals ratios
of 1/30 to 1/2. The modeled dust size distributions are used to synthesize an

resemble that observed in some regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The 2175

to have near-infrared 2MASS photometry ($JHK_s$ $\pm$ 0.3 mag. or better),
yielding dereddened magnitudes and allowing further investigation by comparison

slightly the configuration dependence of the reduced 3-point function Q3 ~
xi_3/xi_2^2. On smaller scales (< 10 Mpc/h), Q3 develops a characteristic
U-shape anisotropy between elongated and open triangles due to the effects of
velocity dispersion. We show that this shape is quite universal, very weakly
dependent on scale, initial spectral index or cosmological parameters and
should be detectable in current galaxy surveys even if affected by shot-noise
or galaxy bias. We present a detailed method for obtaining constraints on
galaxy bias parameters from measurements of Q3 in current galaxy redshift
surveys, based on the eigenmode analysis similar to the one developed for the
bispectrum. We show that our method recovers the bias parameters introduced
into mock galaxies by a HOD prescription and is also able to handle potential
systematics in the case when a smaller number than ideal of mock catalogs is
used to estimate the covariance matrix. We find that current redshift surveys

particle hydrodynamics simulations of massive discs. These new simulations show
a much more complex temporal evolution with respect to the less massive case.
Whereas in the low disc mass case a self-regulated, marginally stable state
(characterized by an approximately constant radial profile of the stability
parameter $Q$) is easily established, in the high disc mass case we observe the
development of an initial transient and subsequent settling down in a
self-regulated state in some simulations, or a series or recurrent spiral
episodes, with low azimuthal wave number $m$, in others. Accretion in this last
case can therefore be a highly variable process. On the other hand, we find
that the secular evolution of the disc is relatively slow. In fact, the
time-average of the stress induced by self-gravity results in accretion
time-scales much longer than the dynamical timescale, in contrast with previous
isothermal simulations of massive accretion discs. We have also compared the
resulting stress tensor with the expectations based on a local theory of
transport, finding no significant evidence for global wave energy transport.

in polarization across the broad Halpha line, which are observed in a

rotating line-emitting disc surrounded by a co-planar scattering region (the
equatorial scattering region). The predicted polarization properties are:
averaged over wavelength, the position angle of polarization is aligned with
the projected disc rotation axis and hence also with the radio source axis;
(ii) the polarization PA rotates across the line profile, reaching equal but
opposite (relative to the continuum PA) rotations in the blue and red wings;
(iii) the degree of polarization peaks in the line wings and passes through a
minimum in the line core. We identify 11 objects which exhibit these features
to different degrees. In order to reproduce the large amplitude PA rotations
observed in some cases, the scattering region must closely surround the
emission disc and the latter must itself be a relatively narrow annulus --
presumably the Halpha-emitting zone of a larger accretion disc. Asymmetries in
the polarization spectra may be attributable to several possible causes,
including bulk radial infall in the equatorial scattering region, or
contamination by polar scattered light. The broad Halpha lines do not, in
general, exhibit double-peaked profiles, suggesting that a second

and vertical gravity is not applied to the gas. Using a two-fluid approach,
small dust grains of various sizes (with friction times up to $\varOmega_0
\tau_{\rm f}=0.02$) are allowed to move under the influence of friction with
the turbulent gas. We measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of the dust
grains by applying an external sinusoidal force field acting in the vertical
direction on the dust component only. This concentrates the dust around the
mid-plane of the disc, and an equilibrium distribution of the dust density is
achieved when the vertical settling is counteracted by the turbulent diffusion
away from the mid-plane. Comparing with analytical expressions for the
equilibrium concentration we deduce the vertical turbulent diffusion
coefficient. The vertical diffusion coefficient is found to be lower than the
turbulent viscosity and to have an associated vertical diffusion Prandtl number
of about 1.5. A similar radial force field also allows us to measure the radial
turbulent diffusion coefficient. We find a radial diffusion Prandtl number of
about 0.85 and also find that the radial turbulent diffusion coefficient is

formed simultaneously. Under the opposite assumption -- namely that star
formation occurred randomly -- we estimate that HC lifetime is less than
$\sim$1/3 of that of UCHII regions on the basis of the source number ratio
between them.

physical phenomena that accompany the presence of large scale fields, such as
those claimed in the literature. I show that a single star cannot supply the
energy and angular momentum if the magnetic fields have the large coherent
structure required to shape the circumstellar wind. Therefore, the structure of
non-spherical planetary nebulae cannot be attributed to dynamically important
large scale magnetic fields. I conclude that the observed magnetic fields

can have a secondary role in the shaping of the PN. The primary role, I argue,
rests with the presence of a companion.

associated with the \UCHII s. In this paper, we show that the carbon RLs
provide important, complementary information on the kinematics and physical
properties of the ambient medium near \UCHII s. Non-LTE models for the carbon
line forming region are developed, assuming that the PDRs surround the \UCHII
s, and we constrained the model parameters by multi-frequency RL data. Modeling
shows that carbon RL emission near 8.5 GHz is dominated by stimulated emission
and hence we preferentially observe the PDR material that is in front of the
\UCHII continuum. We find that the relative motion between ionized gas and the
associated PDR is about half that estimated earlier, and has an RMS velocity
difference of 3.3 \kms. Our models also give estimates for the PDR density and
pressure. We found that the neutral density of PDRs is typically $>$ 5 $\times$

pycnonuclear burning of matter accreted on a neutron star in a soft X-ray
transient (SXT, a compact binary containing a neutron star and a low-mass
companion). The energy released in this burning, while the matter sinks into
the stellar crust under the weight of newly accreted material, is sufficient to
warm up the star and initiate neutrino emission in its core. The surface
thermal radiation of the star in quiescent states becomes dependent of poorly
known equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear matter in the stellar core, which
gives a method to explore this EOS. Four qualitatively different model EOSs are
tested against observations of SXTs. They imply different levels of the

years, especially due to its long-lived meta-equilibrium states, which exhibit
a series of anomalies, such as, breakdown of ergodicity, anomalous diffusion,
aging, and non-Maxwell velocity distributions. The most widely investigated
meta-equilibrium states of the HMF arise from special (fully magnetized)
initial conditions that evolve to a spatially homogeneous state with well
defined macroscopic characteristics and whose lifetime increases with the
system size, eventually reaching equilibrium. These meta-equilibrium states
have been observed for specific energies close below the critical value 0.75,
corresponding to a ferromagnetic phase transition, and disappear below a
certain energy close to 0.68. In the thermodynamic limit, the $\mu$-space
dynamics is governed by a Vlasov equation. For finite systems this is an
approximation to the exact dynamics. However, it provides an explanation, for
instance, for the violent initial relaxation and for the disappearance of the
homogeneous states at energies below 0.68.

their degree of disorder. Recent coherent x-ray speckle experiments on magnetic
films have measured the loss of correlation between configurations at opposite
fields and at the same field, upon repeated field cycling. We perform finite
temperature numerical simulations on these systems that provide a comprehensive
explanation for the experimental results. The simulations demonstrate, in
accordance with experiments, that the memory of configurations increases with
film disorder. We find that non-trivial microscopic differences exist between
the zero field spin configuration obtained by starting from a large positive
field and the zero field configuration starting at a large negative field. This
seemingly paradoxical beahvior is due to the nature of the vector spin dynamics
and is also seen in the experiments. For low disorder, there is an instability
which causes the spontaneous growth of line-like domains at a critical field,
also in accord with experiments. It is this unstable growth, which is highly
sensitive to thermal noise, that is responsible for the small correlation
between patterns under repeated cycling. The domain patterns, hysteresis loops,
and memory properties of our simulated systems match remarkably well with the
real experimental systems.

the spatial structure of this phase in the presence of an inhomogeneous

recipe for creating a structure with any desired number of shells, and explore
the stability of the structure under typical experimental conditions. The
stability analysis gives some constraints on how successfully these states can
be employed for quantum information experiments. The experimental probe we

sidebands in photoluminescence (PL): the multi-phonon components in the GS
produce the Stokes lines and the zero-phonon components in the excited states
produce the anti-Stokes lines. By introducing the mixing of the LO mode and
environal phonon modes, the exciton will also couple with the latter, and the
resultant polaron states result in another set of phonon sidebands. This set
has a zero-phonon line higher and wider than that of the first set due to the
tremendous number of the environal modes. The energy spacing between the

the strong coupling of excitons and LO phonons leads to not only traditional
Stokes lines (SLs) but also up to second-order anti-Stokes lines (ASLs) besides
the zero-phonon line (ZPL). The SLs and ASLs are found to be not mirror
symmetric with respect to the ZPL, strongly suggesting that they are from
different coupling states of exciton and phonons. It is more interesting that a
new group of peaks, including a ZPL and several SLs, are observed. The
observations can be explained with a newly developed theory in which this group
is attributed to the ground excitonic polaron state and the other group is from
the excited polaron states with LO phonon components partially decaying into
environal phonon modes. Besides these spectral features showing the
quasiparticle properties of exciton-phonon coupling system, the first-order SL
is found to exhibit characteristic Fano lineshape, caused by quantum
interference between the LO components of excitonic polarons and the environal

declaratively representing and solving hard problems. Many NP-complete problems
can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise
and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical ""guess and check""
nature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial
size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the
problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond
NP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial
hierarchy. While these problems also have a clear ""guess and check"" structure,
finding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a
non-obvious task, in particular if the ""check"" itself is a coNP-complete
problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and
check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check
program. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free
(extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended)
disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer
sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence,
and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a
designated answer set of the transformed program. Our transformations
facilitate the integration of separate ""guess"" and ""check"" programs, which are
often easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program.
Our results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in ASP, and extend
methods and techniques for a declarative ""guess and check"" problem solving
paradigm through ASP.

multitude of areas of physics, ranging from the Kondo effect in condensed
matter theory to tachyon condensation in string theory. Invoking a
correspondence between CFT on 1+1 dimensional manifolds with boundaries and
Chern-Simons gauge theory on 2+1 dimensional Z_2 orbifolds, we show that the
1+1 dimensional conformal boundary scattering problem can be reformulated as an
Aharonov-Bohm effect experienced by chiral edge states moving on a 1+1
dimensional boundary of the corresponding 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons system.
The secretly topological origin of this physics leads to a new and simple
derivation of the scattering of a massless scalar field on the line interacting

identification of boundaries of Mandelbrot sets with discriminant varieties in

(integrability) respectively. To understand and exploit this relation one needs
first to develop the theory of discrete dynamics as a solid branch of algebraic
geometry, which so far did not pay enough attention to iterated maps. The basic
object to study in this context is Julia sheaf over the universal Mandelbrot
set. The base has a charateristic combinatorial structure, which can be
revealed by resultant analysis and represented by a basic graph. Sections
(Julia sets) are contractions of a unit disc, related to the action of Abelian
$\bb{Z}$ group on the unit circle. Their singularities (bifurcations) are
located at the points of the universal discriminant variety.

invariants appearing in the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian, and the
fusion coefficients for the WZW conformal field theories associated to
\hat{su}(\ell) are shown to be k-Littlewood Richardson coefficients. From this,
Mark Shimozono conjectured that the k-Schur functions form the Schubert basis
for the homology of the loop Grassmannian, whereas k-Schur coproducts
correspond to the integral cohomology of the loop Grassmannian. We introduce
dual k-Schur functions defined on weights of k-tableaux that, given Shimozono's
conjecture, form the Schubert basis for the cohomology of the loop
Grassmannian. We derive several properties of these functions that extend those
of skew Schur functions.

configurations calculated from the quantum description, rather than the more
usual approach of fitting to a wide range of empirical data. The scheme is
illustrated in detail for a model system, silica nanorod that has the proper
stiochiometric ratio of Si:O as observed in real silica. The potential is
chosen to be pairwise additive, with the same pair potential functional form as
familiar phenomenological TTAM potential. Here, the parameters are determined
using a genetic algorithm with force data obtained directly from a quantum
calculation. The resulting potential gives excellent agreement with properties
of the reference quantum calculations both for structure (bond lengths, bond
angles) and elasticity (Young's modulus). The proposed method for constructing
the classical potential is carried out for two different choices for the

an expression for the stationary probability density of the membrane voltage;
in the second paper this expression was modified to cover a larger parameter

made in the derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density.

on QED in linear, causal media. Both ground-state and excited atoms are
considered. Whereas the Casimir-Polder force acting on a ground-state atom can
conveniently be derived from a perturbative calculation of the atom-field

components that can only be fully understood by a dynamical treatment based on
the body-assisted vacuum Lorentz force. The results show that the

shifting of atomic transitions - an effect that is not accounted for within
lowest-order perturbation theory. The theory is used to study the

failure signal or only one does. In the latter case, if the states share the
same Schmidt basis, the states can be discriminated with the same failure
probability as would be obtained if the two qubits were measured together. This
scheme is sufficiently simple that it can be generalized to multipartite qubit
and qudit states. Applications to quantum secret sharing are discussed.
Finally, we present an optical scheme to experimenatlly realize the protocol in
the case of two qubits.
