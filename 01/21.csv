(VLT/FORS) optical spectra of the normal type Ia supernova, SN 2001el. The
high-resolution spectra were obtained at -9 and -2 days to allow the detection
of narrow hydrogen and/or helium emission lines from the circumstellar medium
of the SN. No such lines were detected, and we therefore use photoionisation
models to derive upper limits of 9x10^-6 Msun/yr and 5x10^-5 Msun/yr for the
mass loss rate from the progenitor system assuming velocities of 10 km/s and 50
km/s, respectively, for a wind extending to outside at least a few x 10^15 cm
away from the SN explosion site. These limits exclude a symbiotic star in the
upper mass loss rate regime from being the progenitor of SN 2001el. The low
resolution spectrum was obtained in the nebular phase of the SN, 400 days after
the maximum light, to search for any hydrogen rich gas originating from the SN
progenitor system. However, we see no signs of Balmer lines in our spectrum.
Therefore, we model the late time spectra to derive an upper limit of ~0.03
Msun for solar abundance material present at velocities lower than 1000 km/s
within the SN explosion site. According to simulations of Marietta et al.
(2000) this is less than the expected mass lost by a subgiant, red giant or
main sequence secondary star at a small binary separation as a result of the SN
explosion. Finally, we discuss the origin of high velocity Ca II lines. We see
both the CaII IR triplet and the H&K lines in the -9 days spectrum at a very
high velocity of up to 34000 km/s. The spectrum also shows a flat-bottomed Si
II `6150 A' feature similar to the one previously observed in SN 1990N at -14
days. We compare these spectral features to those observed in SNe 1984A and
1990N at even higher velocities.

blackbody photons produced in the thermal mound. These photons diffuse through
the infalling gas and eventually escape out the walls of the column, forming
the observed X-ray spectrum. We show that the resulting column-integrated,

Specifically, in the PG quasar sample the equivalent width of the narrow [O
III] 5007 line has a range of >300, while the broad Hb line, for example, has a
range of 10 only. The strength of [O III] 5007 is modulated by the covering
factor, CF, of the narrow line region (NLR) gas, its density n_e, and
ionization parameter U. To explore which of these factors produces the observed
large range in [O III] 5007 strength, we measure the strength of the matching
narrow Hb and [O III] 4363 lines, detected in 40 out of the 87 z<0.5 PG quasars
in the Boroson & Green sample. The photoionization code CLOUDY is then used to
infer CF, n_e, and U in each object, assuming a single uniform emitting zone.
We find that the range of CF (~0.02-0.2) contributes about twice as much as the
range in both n_e and U towards modulating the strength of the [O III] 5007
line. The CF is inversely correlated with luminosity, but it is not correlated
with L_Edd as previously speculated. The single zone [O III] 5007 emitting
region is rather compact, having R=40L_44^0.45 pc. These emission lines can
also be fit with an extreme two zone model, where [O III] 4363 is mostly
emitted by a dense (n_e=10^7) inner zone at R=L_44^0.5 pc, and [O III] 5007 by
a low density (n_e=10^3) extended outer zone at R=750L_44^0.34 pc. Such an
extended [O III] 5007 emission should be well resolved by HST imaging of
luminous AGN. Further constraints on the radial gas distribution in the NLR can
be obtained from the spectral shape of the IR continuum emitted by the

believed to be essential components of galaxies, and their evolutionary states

not go much beyond this; galaxies such as NGC 5128 (an AGN and recent merger)
can further develop this knowledge. However, NGC 5128 and galaxies like it
contain large amounts of dust which hamper optical spectroscopy, making
near-infrared measurements an attractive alternative. We find a BH mass of

eventually follow the trend for quiescent galaxies, this result suggests that
its BH assembled first before its host component. NGC 5128 thus provides an

mass of clusters in the merger sample is on average ~43% larger than the mass
of the two progenitors (m_1 + m_2), whereas in the steady accretion mode sample
a smaller increase of ~25% is found. The separation vector connecting the two
most massive progenitor halos at z=0.5 is strongly correlated with the
orientation of the cluster at z=0. The angular momentum of the clusters in the
recent major merger sample tends to be parallel to orbital angular momentum of
the two progenitors, whereas the angular momentum of the steady accretion mode
sample is mainly determined by the angular momentum of the most massive
progenitor. The long range correlations for the major and the minor principal
axes of cluster pairs extend to distances of ~100 Mpc/h. Weak angular momentum
correlations are found for distances < 20 Mpc/h. Within these ranges the major
axes tend to be aligned with the connecting line of the cluster pairs whereas
minor axes and angular momenta tend to be perpendicular to this line. A
separate analysis of the two sub-samples reveals that the long range
correlations are independent of the mass accretion mode. Thus orientation and
angular momentum of galaxy clusters is mainly determined by the accretion along
the filaments independently of the particular accretion mode.

this model, material produced by an off-center deflagration (which itself fails
to produce the explosion) forms a metal-rich atmosphere above the white dwarf
surface. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this atmosphere is
compressed and accelerated during the subsequent interaction with the supernova
ejecta. This leads ultimately to the formation of a high-velocity pancake of
metal-rich material that is geometrically detached from the bulk of the ejecta.
When observed at the epochs near maximum light, this absorbing pancake produces
a highly blueshifted and polarized calcium IR triplet absorption feature
similar to that observed in several Type~Ia supernovae. We discuss the
orientation effects present in our model and contrast them to those expected in
other supernova explosion models. We propose that a large sample of

boundary, the so-called zero torque boundary condition, has been employed by
models of black hole disks for many years. However, recent theoretical and
observational work suggests that magnetic forces may appreciably torque the
inner disk. This raises the question of the effect that a time-changing
magnetic torque may have on the evolution of such a disk. In particular, we
explore the suggestion that the ``Deep Minimum State'' of the Seyfert galaxy
MCG--6-30-15 can be identified as a sporadic inner disk torquing event. This
suggestion is motivated by detailed analyses of changes in the profile of the
broad fluorescence iron line in XMM-Newton spectra. We find that the response
of such a disk to a torquing event has two phases; an initial damming of the
accretion flow together with a partial draining of the disk interior to the
torque location, followed by a replenishment of the inner disk as the system
achieves a new (torqued) steady-state. If the Deep Minimum State of
MCG--6-30-15 is indeed due to a sporadic torquing event, we show that the
fraction of the dissipated energy going into X-rays must be smaller in the
torqued state. We propose one such scenario in which Compton cooling of the
disk corona by ``returning radiation'' accompanying a central-torquing event
suppresses the 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux coming from all but the innermost regions
of the disk.

upper frequency is fitted by a rotating hotspot near the inner edge of the

the lower frequency is fitted by another rotating hotspot somewhere away from
the inner edge of the disc, which arises from the screw instability of the
magnetic field on the disc. It turns out that the 3:2 frequency ratio of HFQPOs

to the ion-bombardment by an ion supported accretion flow (here ISAF, or
optically thin ADAF). As first suggested by Spruit & Deufel (2002), this
evaporation takes place in two stages: ion bombardment of the cool disk
(Shakura-Sunyaev disk: SSD) produces an intermediate-temperature layer on top
of the disk (`warm layer') which constitutes an independent accretion flow on
both sides of the SSD. As this warm material accretes inward of the inner
radius of the SSD, it becomes thermally unstable by lack of cooling of photons,
and evaporates into the ISAF, thereby feeding the latter. Angular momentum
conservation forces a certain fraction of the ISAF material to move outward,
where it can bombard the SSD with its hot ions. The flow geometry is derived by
computing stationary solutions of the continuity- and angular momentum
equations for the three components (ISAF, warm flow and SSD). The overall
radiative output is dominated by hard X-rays. They are produced mostly from the
warm component, rather than the ISAF. The expected time dependence and
stability of the flow, not computed here, is discussed briefly.

introduction with rapid population growth once introduction does succeed. To
analyze this phenomenon, we note that invaders often cluster spatially when
rare, and consequently an introduced exotic's population dynamics should depend
on locally structured interactions. Ecological theory for spatially structured
invasion relies on deterministic approximations, and determinism does not
address the observed uncertainty of the exotic-introduction process. We take a
new approach to the population dynamics of invasion and, by extension, to the
general question of invasibility in any spatial ecology. We apply the physical
theory for nucleation of spatial systems to a lattice-based model of
competition between plant species, a resident and an invader, and the analysis
reaches conclusions that differ qualitatively from the standard ecological
theories. Nucleation theory distinguishes between dynamics of single-cluster
and multi-cluster invasion. Low introduction rates and small system size
produce single-cluster dynamics, where success or failure of introduction is
inherently stochastic. Single-cluster invasion occurs only if the cluster
reaches a critical size, typically preceded by a number of failed attempts. For
this case, we identify the functional form of the probability distribution of
time elapsing until invasion succeeds. Although multi-cluster invasion for
sufficiently large systems exhibits spatial averaging and almost-deterministic
dynamics of the global densities, an analytical approximation from nucleation
theory, known as Avrami's law, describes our simulation results far better than
standard ecological approximations.

considering only the ring-like structure of the Cherenkov image, gives an
unsatisfactory resolution for 1GeV electron and muon, with a mean vertex
position error, delta r, of 5-10 m and a mean directional error, delta theta,
of about 6-20 degrees. In contrast, a geometrical reconstruction procedure
utilizing the full image and using a detailed approximation of the event
angular distribution works much better: for a 1 GeV electron, delta r is about
2 m and delta theta is about 3 degrees; for a 1GeV muon, delta r is about 3 m
and delta theta is about 5 degrees. At 5 GeV, the corresponding values are
about 1.4 m and about 2 degree for electron and are about 2.9m and about 4.3
degrees for muon. The numerical values depend on a single PMT contribution
threshold. The values quoted above are the minima with respect to this

  Oct 3-9, 2004",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been measured to 0.5 ppm in a
series of precision experiments at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient
Synchrotron. The individual results for each sign: a(mu+)= 11 659 204(7)(5)
E-10 and a(mu-) = 11 659 214(8)(3) E-10 are consistent with each other, so that
we can write the average anomaly as a(mu)(exp) = 11 659 208(6) E-10 (0.5 ppm).
A discrepancy between the measured value and the Standard Model (Delta a(mu))
is a signal for new physics. Assuming that such a discrepancy is due to
contributions from supersymmetric particles provides a framework which can be
used to constrain the mass of the dark matter particles, assumed to be the
lightest neutral supersymmetric particles. The deviation from the standard
model has varied between 1.5 sigma and 3 sigma significance, dominated by
uncertainties in the hadronic contribution to the standard model calculation.
Currently the standard model prediction is calculated to 0.6 ppm precision and
Delta a(mu) = 23.5 (9.0) E-10, representing a 2.6 sigma deviation. We expect
that the error on a(mu)(SM) will be reduced by a factor of two within the next
decade. To fully utilize this improvement, a new g-2 run is proposed for the
near future. If the mean Delta a(mu) remains the same, this would result in
close to a 6 sigma discrepancy. In this case, we would expect to see SUSY
particles at the LHC and use the g-2 results to measure tan beta. If, instead,
the Standard Model is confirmed to this precision, gauginos must have masses
higher than ~ 500 GeV/c2 and simple SUSY dark matter models will be severely
constrained.

color dipole picture, valid in the limit where the number of colors is large,

amplitudes and dipole densities, which amount to neglecting the non-locality of
the two-gluon exchanges. In this Letter, we relax the latter approximations,
and thus restore the correct structure of the `triple-pomeron vertex' which
describes the splitting of one BFKL pomeron into two within the terms
responsible for fluctuations. The ensuing triple-pomeron vertex coincides with
the one previously derived by Braun and Vacca within perturbative QCD. The

phenomenology that escaped theorists' attention so far. Good diquarks, i.e. the
$0^{+}$ states of two quarks, are argued to have a two-component structure with
one of the components peaking at distances several times shorter than a typical
hadron size (a short-range core). This can play a role in solving two old
puzzles of the 't Hooft 1/N expansion: strong quark mass dependence of the
vacuum energy density and strong violations of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI)
rule in the quark-antiquark $0^\pm$ channels. In both cases empiric data defy
't Hooft's 1/N suppression. If good diquarks play a role at an intermediate
energy scale they ruin 't Hoofts planarity because of their mixed-flavor
composition. This new scale associated with the good diquarks may be related to
a numerically large scale discovered in [V. Novikov, M. Shifman, A. Vainshtein
and V. Zakharov, Nucl. Phys. B 191, 301 (1981)] in a number of phenomena mostly
related to vacuum quantum numbers and $0^\pm$ glueball channels. If SU(3)$_{\rm
color}$ of bona fide QCD is replaced by SU(2)$_{\rm color}$, diquarks become
well-defined gauge invariant objects. Moreover, there is an exact symmetry
relating them to pions. In this limit predictions regarding good diquarks are
iron-clad. If passage from SU(2)$_{\rm color}$ to SU(3)$_{\rm color}$ does not
lead to dramatic disturbances, these predictions remain qualitatively valid in
bona fide QCD.

massive dispersion relation of the waves can be appreciated, and the Coulomb
force can be used to communicate faster than the speed of light. In fact,
electrical signals are transmitted instantly, but take a time ~ 1/m to build up

set in and continue until they are dispersed by the arrival of the

formulated by the second quantized formulation. This formulation exhibits a
hidden local gauge symmetry related to the arbitrariness of the phase choice of
the complete orthonormal basis set. By using this second quantized formulation,
which does not assume adiabatic approximation, a convenient exact formula for
the geometric terms including off-diagonal geometric terms is derived. The
analysis of geometric phases is then reduced to a simple diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian, and it is analyzed both in the operator and path integral
formulations. If one diagonalizes the geometric terms in the infinitesimal
neighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial (and thus
no monopole singularity) for arbitrarily large but finite time interval $T$.
The integrability of Schr\""{o}dinger equation and the appearance of the
seemingly non-integrable phases are thus consistent. The topological proof of
the Longuet-Higgins' phase-change rule, for example, fails in the practical
Born-Oppenheimer approximation where a large but finite ratio of two time
scales is involved and $T$ is identified with the period of the slower system.
The difference and similarity between the geometric phases associated with
level crossing and the exact topological object such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase
become clear in the present formulation. A crucial difference between the
quantum anomaly and the geometric phases is also noted.

equations of motion and currents are found to be also valid on the quantized

the presence of supergravity, as compared with well-studied effective
supersymmetric theories containing at most two derivatives (including nonlinear
Kahler sigma-models). As a result, when deriving their canonically normalized
component actions, it becomes impractical and cumbersome to follow the
traditional approach of (i) reducing to components; and then (ii) applying a
field-dependent Weyl and local chiral transformation. It proves to be more
efficient to follow the Kugo-Uehara scheme which consists of (i) extending the
superfield theory to a super-Weyl invariant system; and then (ii) applying a
plain component reduction along with imposing a suitable super-Weyl gauge
condition. Here we implement this scheme to derive the bosonic action of
self-dual supersymmetric electrodynamics coupled to the dilaton-axion chiral
multiplet and a Kahler sigma-model. In the fermionic sector, the action
contains higher derivative terms. In the globally supersymmetric case, a
nonlinear field redefinition is explicitly constructed which eliminates all the
higher derivative terms and brings the fermionic action to a one-parameter
deformation of the Akulov-Volkov action for the Goldstino. The Akulov-Volkov

  differential forms on jet space. Accepted in Acta Applicandae Mathematicae","Acta Appl. Math. 89 (2005), 1-52",,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  New nonlocal symmetries and conservation laws are derived for Maxwell's
equations using a covariant system of joint vector potentials for the
electromagnetic tensor field and its dual. A key property of this system, as
well as of this class of new symmetries and conservation laws, is their
invariance under the duality transformation that exchanges the electromagnetic
field with its dual. The nonlocal symmetries of Maxwell's equations come from
an explicit classification of all symmetries of a certain geometric form
admitted by the joint potential system in Lorentz gauge. In addition to scaling
and duality-rotation symmetries, and the well-known Poincare and dilation
symmetries which involve homothetic Killing vectors, the classification yields
new geometric symmetries involving Killing-Yano tensors related to
rotations/boosts and inversions. The nonlocal conservation laws of Maxwell's
equations are constructed from these geometric symmetries by applying a formula
that uses the joint potentials and directly generates conserved currents from
any (local or nonlocal) symmetries of Maxwell's equations. This formula is
shown to arise through a series of mappings that relate, respectively,
symmetries/adjoint-symmetries of the joint potential system and
adjoint-symmetries/symmetries of Maxwell's equations. The mappings are derived
as by-products of the study of cohomology of closed 1-forms and 2-forms locally
constructed from the electromagnetic field and its derivatives to some finite
order for all solutions of Maxwell's equations. The only nontrivial cohomology
is shown to consist of the electromagnetic field (2-form) itself as well as its
dual (2-form), and this 2-form cohomology is killed by the introduction of
corresponding potentials.

thermodynamic limit such that the particle density converges to a finite value,
the boson/fermion processes are obtained. This argument is a realization of the

introducing a larger class of ""admissible"" trees with possibly doubly-occupied

extension of the cutting procedure allowing for the presence on the maps of
special non-sectile edges. The admissible trees are characterized by simple

different term orders. It is based on the polyhedral geometry of the Groebner
fan and involves tracking a line between cones representing the initial and
target term order. An important parameter is explicit numerical perturbation of
this line. This usually involves both time and space demanding arithmetic of
integers much larger than the input numbers. In this paper we show how the
explicit line may be replaced by a formal line using Robbiano's
characterization of group orders on Q^n. This gives rise to the generic
Groebner walk involving only Groebner basis conversion over facets and
computations with marked polynomials. The proposed technique is closely related
to the lexicographic (symbolic) perturbation method used in optimization and
computational geometry. We report on computations with toric ideals, where a
version of our algorithm in certain cases computes test sets for hard integer
knapsack problems significantly faster than the Buchberger algorithm.

Geminate recombination dynamics of hydrated electrons generated by 200 nm
photoexcitation of aqueous anions (I-, Br-, OH-, HS-, CNS-, CO32-, SO32-, and
Fe(CN)64-) have been studied. Prompt quantum yields for the formation of
solvated, thermalized electrons and quantum yields for free electrons were
determined. Pump-probe kinetics for 200 nm photoexcitation were compared with
kinetics obtained at lower photoexcitation energy (225 nm or 242 nm) for the
same anions, where possible. Free diffusion and mean force potential models of
geminate recombination dynamics were used to analyze these kinetics. These
analyses suggest that for polyatomic anions (including all polyvalent anions
studied) the initial electron distribution has a broad component, even at
relatively low photoexcitation energy. There seem to be no well-defined
threshold energy below which the broadening of the distribution does not occur,
as is the case for halide anions. Direct ionization to the conduction band of
water is the most likely photoprocess broadening the electron distribution. Our
study suggests that halide anions are in the class of their own; electron
photodetachment from polyatomic, especially polyvalent, anions follows a
different set of rules.

fluorescence, which, for a two-level system, has a well-known characteristic

transitions among laser-dressed states which are the energy eigenstates of a

recently shown, the quasi-energies of the laser-dressed states receive
radiative corrections which are nontrivially different from the results which
one would expect from an investigation of the coupling of the bare states to
the vacuum modes. In this article, we briefly review the basic elements

  title. Transferred to PRA","Phys. Rev. A 77, 032114 (2008)","10.1103/PhysRevA.77.032114",,"quant-ph",,"  Superselection rules (SSRs) limit the mechanical and quantum processing
resources represented by quantum states. However SSRs can be violated using
reference systems to break the underlying symmetry. We show that there is a
duality between the ability of a system to do mechanical work and to act as a
reference system. Further, for a bipartite system in a globally symmetric pure
state, we find a triality between the system's ability to do local mechanical
work, its ability to do ``logical work'' due to its accessible entanglement,
and its ability to act as a shared reference system.
