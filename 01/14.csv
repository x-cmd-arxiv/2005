conducted with two spectrographs: Coralie mounted on the 1.2-m Swiss telescope
at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile) and Elodie based on the 1.93-m
telescope at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (France). In total, 1239
spectra were collected over 13 nights. The power spectrum of the high precision
velocity time series clearly presents several identifiable peaks between 0.4
and 1.0 mHz showing regularity with a large and small separations of Delta_nu =
39.9 uHz and delta_nu02 = 3.95 uHz respectively. Twenty-two individual
frequencies have been identified. Detailed models based on these measurements
and non-asteroseismic observables were computed using the Geneva evolution code
including shellular rotation and atomic diffusion. By combining these
seismological data with non-asteroseismic observations, we determine the
following global parameters for eta Boo: a mass of 1.57 +- 0.07 M_sol, an age
t=2.67 +- 0.10 Gyr and an initial metallicity Z/X_i=0.0391 +- 0.0070. We also
show that the mass of eta Boo is very sensitive to the choice of the observed
metallicity, while the age of eta Boo depends on the input physics used.
Indeed, a higher metallicity favours a higher mass, while non-rotating models
without overshooting predict a smaller age.

Eridani. More than 600 hours of differential photoelectric uvyV photometry were
obtained with 11 telescopes during 148 clear nights. The frequency analysis of

sinusoidal components, eight of which correspond to independent pulsation
frequencies between 5 - 8 c/d. Some of these are arranged in multiplets, which
suggests rotational m-mode splitting of nonradial pulsation modes as the cause.
If so, the rotation period of the star must be between 30 - 60 d. One of the
signals in the light curves of Nu Eri has a very low frequency of 0.432 c/d. It
can be a high-order combination frequency or, more likely, an independent
pulsation mode. In the latter case Nu Eri would be both a Beta Cephei star and
a slowly pulsating B (SPB) star. The photometric amplitudes of the individual
pulsation modes of Nu Eri appear to have increased by about 20 per cent over
the last 40 years. So do the amplitudes of the dominant combination frequencies
of the star. Among the latter, we only could identify sum frequencies with
certainty, not difference frequencies, which suggests that neither light-curve
distortion in its simplest form nor resonant mode coupling are their single
cause. One of our comparison stars, Mu Eridani, turned out to be variable with
a dominant time scale of 1.62 d. We believe that it is either an SPB star just
leaving its instability strip or that its variations are of rotational origin.

small perturbations; such vortices cannot maintain vertical alignment over more

the formation of 3D vortices that are centered not in the midplane, but at one

vorticity; anticyclonic regions of vorticity roll-up and coalesce into new

flattening q=0.9), consistent with recent constraints from the Sagittarius

the spectrum exactly in the same way the boundary layer of a neutron star does.
The CENBOL is produced due to standing or oscillating shock waves and these
shocks accelerate electrons very efficiently and produce a power-law
distribution. The accelerated particles in turn emit synchrotron radiation in
presence of the magnetic field. We study the spectral properties of an
accretion disk as a function of the shock strength, compression ratio, flow
accretion rate and flow geometry. In the absence of a satisfactory description
of magnetic fields inside the advective disk, we consider the presence of only
stochastic fields and use the ratio of the field energy density to the
gravitational energy density to be a parameter. Not surprisingly, stronger
fields produce stronger humps due to synchrotron radiation. We not only include
`conventional' synchrotron emission and Comptonization due to Maxwell-Bolzmann
electrons in the gas, we also compute these effects due to power-law electrons.
For strong shocks, a bump is produced at a frequency just above the synchrotron
self-absorption frequency at $\nu_{bump} \sim \nu_{inj} [1+{4/3}\frac{R-1}
{R}\frac{1}{x_s^{1/2}}]^{x_s^{1/2}}$, where, $\nu_{inj}$ is the frequency of
the dominant photons from the pre-shock flow, $R$ is the compression ratio of
the shock located at $x_s$. For strong shocks, a bump at a higher frequency
appears predominantly due to the power-law electrons formed at the shock front.

statistical physics. Only a small proportion of the variables that characterize
a system at the microscopic scale can be controlled, for both practical and
theoretical reasons, and a probabilistic description involving the observers is
required. The criterion of maximum von Neumann entropy is then used for making
reasonable inferences. It means that no spurious information is introduced
besides the known data. Its outcomes can be given a direct justification based
on the principle of indifference of Laplace. We introduce the concept of
relevant entropy associated with some set of relevant variables; it
characterizes the information that is missing at the microscopic level when
only these variables are known. For equilibrium problems, the relevant
variables are the conserved ones, and the Second Law is recovered as a second
step of the inference process. For non-equilibrium problems, the increase of
the relevant entropy expresses an irretrievable loss of information from the
relevant variables towards the irrelevant ones. Two examples illustrate the
flexibility of the choice of relevant variables and the multiplicity of the
associated entropies: the thermodynamic entropy (satisfying the Clausius-Duhem
inequality) and the Boltzmann entropy (satisfying the H-theorem). The
identification of entropy with missing information is also supported by the
paradox of Maxwell's demon. Spin-echo experiments show that irreversibility
itself is not an absolute concept: use of hidden information may overcome the
arrow of time.

kind of noise has been measured: the electrical noise and the mechanical noise.
  For both materials we have observed that the electric noise is characterized
by a strong intermittency, which induces a large violation of the Fluctuation
Dissipation Theorem (FDT) during the aging time, and may persist for several
hours at low frequency. The statistics of these intermittent signals and their
dependance on the quench speed for the polymer or on sample concentration for

still intermittent whereas for the gel the violation of FDT, if it exists, is
extremely small.

the presence of a secondary, space-dependent stochastic force, particularly in

self-consistently through an additional uniform (mean-field) friction [Shepherd
and Hernandez, J. Chem. Phys., 115, 2430-2438 (2001).] An alternative approach
to ensure that equipartition is satisfied relies on the use of a
space-dependent friction while ignoring nonlocal correlations. The approach is
evaluated with respect to its ability to maintain constant temperature for two
simple one-dimensional, stochastic potentials of mean force wherein the
friction can be evaluated explicitly when there is no memory in the barriers.
The use of a space-dependent friction is capable of providing qualitatively
similar results to those obtained previously, but in extreme cases, deviations
from equipartition may be observed due to the neglect of the memory effects

the structure of large carbon clusters produced in a supersonic expansion by a
pulsed microplasma source. The absence of a significant thermal annealing
during the cluster growth causes the formation of disordered structures where
sp2 and sp hybridizations coexist for particles larger than roughly 90 atoms.
Among different structures we recognize sp2 closed networks encaging sp chains.
This ""nutshell"" configuration can prevent the fragmentation of sp species upon
deposition of the clusters thus allowing the formation of nanostructured films
containing carbynoid species, as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Atomistic
simulations confirm that the observed Raman spectra are the signature of the
sp/sp2 hybridization characteristic of the isolated clusters and surviving in
the film and provide information about the structure of the sp chains.
Endohedral sp chains in sp2 cages represent a novel way in which carbon
nanostructures may be organized with potential interesting functional
properties.

Zircaloy corrosion layer may provide more insight to understand the behavior of

constrained system on a symplectic manifold. The constraints determining an
arbitrary constraint surface are in general defined only locally and can be
components of a section of a non-trivial vector bundle over the phase-space
manifold. The covariance of the construction with respect to the change of the
constraint basis is provided by introducing a connection in the ``constraint
bundle'', which becomes a key ingredient of the conversion procedure for the
non-scalar constraints. Unlike in the case of scalar second-class constraints,
no Abelian conversion is possible in general. Within the BRST framework, a
systematic procedure is worked out for converting non-scalar second-class
constraints into non-Abelian first-class ones. The BRST-extended system is
quantized, yielding an explicitly covariant quantization of the original
system. An important feature of second-class systems with non-scalar
constraints is that the appropriately generalized Dirac bracket satisfies the
Jacobi identity only on the constraint surface. At the quantum level, this
results in a weakly associative star-product on the phase space.

programs for relativistic physical fields seems to be an urgent task. The
parameter may take on the values over all the real range; at $g=0$ the space is
reduced to become an ordinary pseudoeuclidean one. In the present work, the
formulation of theory for relativistic physical fields in such a space is
initiated. A general method to solve respective scalar, electromagnetic, and
spinor field equations is proposed basing on the conformal flatness. At any
value of the parameter, the expansion of the relativistic fields with respect
to non-plane waves appeared is found, which proposes a base upon which the
fields can be quantized in context of the Finsleroid-relativistic approach.
Remarkably, the regulators can naturally be proposed to overcome divergences in
relativistic field integrals. The respective key and basic concepts involved
are presented. For short, the abbreviations FMF, FMT, and FHF will be used for
the Finsleroid-relativistic metric function, the associated metric tensor, and

representation theory, probability theory, and random matrix theory using this
simple diffusion particle system. Each vicious walk of $N$ walkers is
represented by an $N$-tuple of nonintersecting lattice paths on the
spatio-temporal plane. There is established a simple bijection between
nonintersecting lattice paths and semistandard Young tableaux. Based on this
bijection and some knowledge of symmetric polynomials called the Schur
functions, we can give a determinantal expression to the partition function of
vicious walks, which is regarded as a special case of the Karlin-McGregor
formula in the probability theory (or the Lindstr\""om-Gessel-Viennot formula in
the enumerative combinatorics). Due to a basic property of Schur function, we
can take the diffusion scaling limit of the vicious walks and define a
noncolliding system of Brownian particles. This diffusion process solves the
stochastic differential equations with the drift terms acting as the repulsive
two-body forces proportional to the inverse of distances between particles, and
thus it is identified with Dyson's Brownian motion model. In other words, the
obtained noncolliding system of Brownian particles is equivalent in
distribution with the eigenvalue process of a Hermitian matrix-valued process.

produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy
densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment
of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by
constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most
probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many
of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in
the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic
framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish
unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The
theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes,
invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as

questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should

chiral dynamics. The s- and p-wave $\pi-N$ interactions are used for the
pion-nucleon residual interactions. We show that the complex energy shifts are
around [(10-20)+i(2-7)]keV for 1s states in Sn, which should be taken into

Titan and Earth were similar in many respects 4 billion years ago, the
approximate time when life originated on Earth. Life may have originated on
Titan during its warmer early history and then developed adaptation strategies
to cope with the increasingly cold conditions. If organisms originated and
persisted, metabolic strategies could exist that would provide sufficient
energy for life to persist, even today. Metabolic reactions might include the
catalytic hydrogenation of photochemically produced acetylene, or involve the
recombination of radicals created in the atmosphere by UV radiation. Metabolic
activity may even contribute to the apparent youth, smoothness, and high

The valence electrons of the Na cluster are described by time-dependent
density-functional theory at the level of the local-density approximation
(LDA). Particular attention is paid to the semi-classical picture in terms of
Vlasov-LDA. The Na ions and Argon atoms are handled as classical particles
whereby the Ar atoms carry two degrees of freedom, position and dipole
polarization. The interaction between Na ions and electrons is mediated through
local pseudo-potentials. The coupling to the Ar atoms is described by
(long-range) polarization potentials and (short-range) repulsive cores. The
ingredients are taken from elsewhere developed standards. A final fine-tuning
is performed using the NaAr molecule as benchmark. The model is then applied to
embedded systems Na8ArN. By close comparison with quantum-mechanical results,
we explore the capability of the Vlasov-LDA to describe such embedded clusters.
We show that one can obtain a reasonable description by appropriate adjustments
in the fine-tuning phase of the model.

for electron transport in the vicinity of valence-conduction bands of
poly(G)-poly(C) and poly(A)-poly(T) DNA. The SSTB parameters are derived from
{\it first principles} and are used to model charge transport through finite
length DNA. We investigate the rigor of reducing the full DNA Hamiltonian to
SSTB model to represent charge transport in the vicinity of valence-conduction
band. While the transmission coefficient spectrum is preserved, its position
shifts in energy. Thymine is poorly represented and its peak height is
substantially reduced. This is attributed to the abstraction of the HOMO-LUMO
coupling to other eigen-states in the nearest neighbor DNA bases, and can be
corrected within $2^{nd}$ order time independent perturbation theory.
Inter-strand charge transport has also been analyzed and it is found that
hopping to the nearest neighbor in the complementary strand is the most
important process except in the valence band of poly(G)-poly(C), where hopping
to the second nearest neighbor between $3'-$ends is the most dominant process.
As a result, transport between $3'-$ends and $5'-$ends in the vicinity of
valence band of poly{G}-poly{C} is asymmetric.

rings of magnets is described. Lattices being explored include scaling sector
cyclotrons with edge focusing and strong focusing, fixed field alternating
gradient (FFAG) rings. Ionization cooling is provided by high pressure hydrogen
gas which removes both transverse and longitudinal momentum. Lost longitudinal
momentum is replaced using radio frequency (RF) cavities, giving a net
transverse emittance reduction. The longer path length in the hydrogen of
higher momentum muons decreases longitudinal emittance at the expense of
transverse emittance. Thus emittance exchange allows these rings to cool in all
six dimensions and not just transversely. Alternatively, if the RF is located
after the ring, it may be possible to cool the muons by stopping them as they
spiral adiabatically into a central swarm. As momentum goes to zero, the
momentum spread goes to zero. The resulting cooled muons can lead to an intense
muon beam which could be a source for neutrino factories or muon colliders.

nodes. The links are described by a real symmetric array r(i,j), i,j=1,...,N.
In a social group, nodes represent group members and links represent relations
between them, positive (friendly) or negative (hostile). At the balanced state,
r(i,j)r(j,k)r(k,i)>0 for all the triads (i,j,k). As follows from the structure
theorem of Cartwright and Harary, at this state the group is divided into two
subgroups, with friendly internal relations and hostile relations between the
subgroups. Here the system dynamics is proposed to be determined by a set of
differential equations. The form of equations guarantees that once HB is
reached, it persists. Also, for N=3 the dynamics reproduces properly the
tendency of the system to the balanced state. The equations are solved
numerically. Initially, r(i,j) are random numbers distributed around zero with
a symmetric uniform distribution of unit width. Calculations up to N=500 show
that HB is always reached. Time to get the balanced state varies with the
system size N as N^{-1/2}. The spectrum of relations, initially narrow, gets
very wide near HB. This means that the relations are strongly polarized. In our
calculations, the relations are limited to a given range around zero. With this
limitation, our results can be helpful in an interpretation of somestatistical
data.

nucleotide substitutions along the human lineage. The study is based on the
analysis of a large amount of repetitive elements deposited into the human
genome since the mammalian radiation, yielding a number of results that would
have been difficult to obtain using the more conventional comparative method of
analysis. This analysis revealed substantial and consistent variability of
rates of substitution, with the variability ranging up to 2-fold among
different regions. The rates of substitutions of C or G nucleotides with A or T
nucleotides vary much more sharply than the reverse rates suggesting that much
of that variation is due to differences in mutation rates rather than in the
probabilities of fixation of C/G vs. A/T nucleotides across the genome. For all
types of substitution we observe substantially more hotspots than coldspots,
with hotspots showing substantial clustering over tens of Mbp's. Our analysis
revealed that GC-content of surrounding sequences is the best predictor of the
rates of substitution. The pattern of substitution appears very different near
telomeres compared to the rest of the genome and cannot be explained by the
genome-wide correlations of the substitution rates with GC content or exon
density. The telomere pattern of substitution is consistent with natural
selection or biased gene conversion acting to increase the GC-content of the
sequences that are within 10-15 Mbp away from the telomere.

correction in spiking neurons were investigated. Stationary discharges -- phase
locked, quasiperiodic, or chaotic -- were induced in a simulated neuron by
presenting pacemaker presynaptic spike trains across a model of a prototypical
inhibitory synapse. Reduced timing precision was modeled by jittering
presynaptic spike times. Aftereffects of errors -- in this communication,
missed presynaptic spikes -- were determined by comparing postsynaptic spike
times between simulations identical except for the presence or absence of
errors. Results show that the effects of an error vary greatly depending on the
ongoing dynamical behavior. In the case of phase lockings, a high degree of
presynaptic spike timing precision can provide significantly faster error
recovery. For non-locked behaviors, isolated missed spikes can have little or
no discernible aftereffects (or even serve to paradoxically reduce uncertainty
in postsynaptic spike timing), regardless of presynaptic imprecision. This
suggests two possible categories of error correction: high-precision locking
with rapid recovery and low-precision non-locked with error immunity.
