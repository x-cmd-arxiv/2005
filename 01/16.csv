abundances for stars cooler than Teff ~ 11,000 K and largely anomalous
abundances for hotter stars: large He depletions, and overabundances of Fe, Ti,
Cr, P and Mn. The abundances of Mg, Si and Ca are roughly normal, in the hot

to the onset of diffusion and to radiation pressure in the stable atmospheres
of hot horizontal branch stars.

SNe 1999br, 1999ev, 2000ew and 2001B are recovered in late time imaging and an
estimate of the progenitor location on the pre-explosion imaging, with
sub-pixel accuracy, has been made. Only the progenitor of the type II-P SN
1999ev has been recovered, on pre-explosion F555W imaging, at a $4.8\sigma$
significance level. Assuming a red supergiant progenitor, the pre-explosion
observation is consistent with $M_{ZAMS}=15-18M_{\odot}$. The progenitors of
the other five SNe were below the $3\sigma$ detection threshold of the
pre-explosion observations. The detection thresholds were translated to mass
limits for the progenitors by comparison with stellar evolution models.
Pre-explosion observations of the peculiarly faint SN 1999br limit the mass of
a red supergiant progenitor to $M_{ZAMS} < 12M_{\odot}$. Analysis has been
extended, from previous studies, to include possible detections of
high-$\mathrm{T_{eff}}$, high-mass stars by conducting synthetic photometry of
model Wolf-Rayet star spectra. The mass limits for the type II-P SNe 1999an and
1999br are consistent with the previously determined mass limits for this type
of SN. The detection limits for the progenitors of the type Ibc SNe (2000ds,
2000ew and 2001B) do not permit differentiation between high-mass WR
progenitors or low mass progenitors in binaries.

by fluorescence microscopy, is in the micrometer range, varying between 2 and 8
microns. The observed stripe-like patterns are stabilized due to dipole-dipole
interactions between terminal -CF3 groups. These interactions are particularly
strong as compared with non-fluorinated lipids due to the low dielectric
constant of the surrounding media (air). These long-range dipolar interactions
tend to elongate the domains, in contrast to the line tension that tends to
minimize the length of the domain boundary. This behavior should be compared
with that of the lipid monolayer having alkyl chains, and which form spherical
micro-domains (bubbles) at the gas-liquid coexistence. The measured stripe
periodicity agrees quantitatively with a theoretical model. Moreover, the
reduction in line tension by adding traces (0.1 mol fraction) of cholesterol
results, as expected, in a decrease in the domain periodicity.

Formulas in it represent interactive computational problems, and ""truth"" is
understood as algorithmic solvability. Interactive computational problems, in
turn, are defined as a certain sort games between a machine and its
environment, with logical operators standing for operations on such games.
Within the ambitious program of finding axiomatizations for incrementally rich
fragments of this semantically introduced logic, the earlier article ""From
truth to computability I"" proved soundness and completeness for system CL3,
whose language has the so called parallel connectives (including negation),
choice connectives, choice quantifiers, and blind quantifiers. The present
paper extends that result to the significantly more expressive system CL4 with
the same collection of logical operators. What makes CL4 expressive is the
presence of two sorts of atoms in its language: elementary atoms, representing
elementary computational problems (i.e. predicates, i.e. problems of zero
degree of interactivity), and general atoms, representing arbitrary
computational problems. CL4 conservatively extends CL3, with the latter being
nothing but the general-atom-free fragment of the former. Removing the blind
(classical) group of quantifiers from the language of CL4 is shown to yield a
decidable logic despite the fact that the latter is still first-order. A

shows that the norm groups $N(R/E)$ and $N(R_{\rm ab}/E)$ are equal in each of
the following two special cases: (i) $E$ is primarily quasilocal and $R$ is an
intermediate field of a finite Galois extension $M/E$ with a nilpotent Galois
group; (ii) $E$ is quasilocal and the natural Brauer group homomorphism Br$(E)
\to $ Br$(L)$ is surjective, for every finite extension $L$ of $E$. It is also
used for describing the norm groups of formally real quasilocal fields, and of
Henselian discrete valued fields whose finite extensions are strictly PQL. The
paper proves that the condition on $G(M/E)$ in (i) cannot be weakened, and the
surjectivity of the homomorphism Br$(E) \to $ Br$(L)$ is essential for the
validity of (ii).

E 70, 041902 (2004)","10.1103/PhysRevE.70.041902",,"q-bio.PE",,"  In this paper we introduce a class of stochastic population models based on
""patch dynamics"". The size of the patch may be varied, and this allows one to
quantify the departures of these stochastic models from various mean field
theories, which are generally valid as the patch size becomes very large. These
models may be used to formulate a broad range of biological processes in both
spatial and non-spatial contexts. Here, we concentrate on two-species
competition. We present both a mathematical analysis of the patch model, in
which we derive the precise form of the competition mean field equations (and
their first order corrections in the non-spatial case), and simulation results.
These mean field equations differ, in some important ways, from those which are
normally written down on phenomenological grounds. Our general conclusion is
that mean field theory is more robust for spatial models than for a single
isolated patch. This is due to the dilution of stochastic effects in a spatial
setting resulting from repeated rescue events mediated by inter-patch
diffusion. However, discrete effects due to modest patch sizes lead to striking
deviations from mean field theory even in a spatial setting.

The deterministic analogue of our model, recovered when the number of
individuals is infinitely large, is the Volterra system (with density-dependent
prey reproduction) which is well-known to fail to predict cycles. This
difference in behavior can be traced to a resonant amplification of demographic
fluctuations which disappears only when the number of individuals is strictly
infinite. Our results indicate that additional biological mechanisms, such as
predator satiation, may not be necessary to explain observed predator-prey
cycles in real (finite) populations.

in the light of the new theory of quantum perfect correlations.
