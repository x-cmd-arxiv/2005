the end of the cosmic dark ages and the reionization epoch, but it will only be
as good as our ability to accurately model and remove astrophysical foreground
contamination. Previous treatments of this problem have focused on the angular
structure of the signal and foregrounds and what can be achieved with limited
spectral resolution (bandwidths in the 1 MHz range). In this paper we introduce
and evaluate a ``blind'' method to extract the multifrequency 21cm signal by
taking advantage of the smooth frequency structure of the Galactic and
extragalactic foregrounds. We find that 21 cm tomography is typically limited
by foregrounds on scales $k\ll 1h/$Mpc and limited by noise on scales $k\gg
1h/$Mpc, provided that the experimental bandwidth can be made substantially
smaller than 0.1 MHz. Our results show that this approach is quite promising
even for scenarios with rather extreme contamination from point sources and
diffuse Galactic emission, which bodes well for upcoming experiments such as
LOFAR, MWA, PAST, and SKA.

traverse w = -1, although a pair of scalars with w > -1 and w < -1 will work. A

Contrary to expectations, such a crossing model does not instantaneously
resemble a cosmological constant at the moment w = -1 since the density and

nine-year time series of models fit to the X-ray spectrum of NGC4258. Over the

detectably, except for a ~40% drop between two ASCA epochs separated by 3 years
and a ~60% rise between two XMM epochs separated by just 5 months. In contrast,
factor of 2-3 changes are seen in absorbed flux on the timescale of years.
These are uncorrelated with changes in absorbing column and indicative of
central engine variability. The most rapid change in luminosity (5-10 keV) that
we detect is ~30% over 19 days. The warped disk, a known source of H2O maser
emission in NGC4258, is believed to cross the line of sight to the central
engine. We propose that the variations in absorbing column arise from
inhomogeneities sweeping across the line of sight in the rotating disk at the
radius where the disk crosses the line of sight. We estimate that the
inhomogeneities are ~10^15 cm in size at the crossing radius of 0.29 pc,
slightly smaller than the expected scale height of the disk. This result thus
provides strong evidence that the warped accretion disk is the absorber. This
is the first direct confirmation that obscuration in type-2 AGN may, in some
cases, arise in thin, warped accretion disks, rather than in geometrically
thick tori. We do not detect Fe Kalpha line emission in any of our XMM spectra.

During such an event, the planet's flux can be magnified by a factor of ~100 or

its orbit relative to the caustic. If the source star is inside the

infrared colors of most EGPs are phase-dependent, tending to be reddest at
crescent phases in $V-R$ and $R-I$. Assuming circular orbits, we find that at
optical wavelengths most EGPs are 3 to 4 times brighter near full phase than
near greatest elongation for highly-inclined (i.e., close to edge-on) orbits.
Furthermore, we show that the planet/star flux ratios depend strongly on the
Keplerian elements of the orbit, particularly inclination and eccentricity.
Given a sufficiently eccentric orbit, an EGP's atmosphere may make periodic
transitions from cloudy to cloud-free, an effect that may be reflected in the
shape and magnitude of the planet's light curve. Such elliptical orbits also
introduce an offset between the time of the planet's light curve maximum and
the time of full planetary phase, and for some sets of orbital parameters, this
light curve maximum can be a steeply increasing function of eccentricity. We

strong absorption likely coming from the host galaxy, alongside absorption in
HI, SiIV and CIV with blueshifts of up to 2900 km/s from the explosion centre
which we assume originates close to the progenitor. We find no significant
variability of these spectral features. We investigate the origin of the
outflowing material and evaluate various possible progenitor models. The most
plausible explanation is that these result in the fossil stellar wind of a
highly evolved Wolf-Rayet star. However, ionization from the burst itself
prevents the existence of HI, SiIV and CIV close to the afterglow surface where
the fast stellar wind should dominate, and large amounts of blueshifted
hydrogen are not expected in a Wolf-Rayet star wind. We propose that the
Wolf-Rayet star wind is enriched by a hydrogen-rich companion, and that the GRB
has a structured jet geometry in which the gamma rays emerge in a small opening

scenario is able to explain both the spectral line features and the irregular

galaxy NGC 5548. We detect broadened emission lines of O VII and C VI in the

continuously variable, with a 30 % increase in luminosity in the second half of
the observation. No variability in the warm absorber was detected between the
spectra from the first 170 ks and the second part of the observation. The
velocity structure of the X-ray absorber is consistent with the velocity
structure measured simultaneously in the ultraviolet spectra. We find that the
highest velocity outflow component, at -1040 km/s, becomes increasingly
important for higher ionization parameters. This velocity component spans at
least three orders of magnitude in ionization parameter, producing both highly
ionized X-ray absorption lines (Mg XII, Si XIV) as well as UV absorption lines.
A similar conclusion is very probable for the other four velocity components.
Based upon our observations, we argue that the warm absorber probably does not
manifest itself in the form of photoionized clumps in pressure equilibrium with
a surrounding wind. Instead, a model with a continuous distribution of column
density versus ionization parameter gives an excellent fit to our data. From
the shape of this distribution and the assumption that the mass loss through
the wind should be smaller than the accretion rate onto the black hole, we
derive upper limits to the solid angle as small as 10^{-4} sr. From this we
argue that the outflow occurs in density-stratified streamers. The density
stratification across the stream then produces the wide range of ionization
parameter observed in this source. Abridged.

from sub-gap states, and 2 k_F from the continuum. The results are based
independently on a self-consistent slave-boson mean field theory for the t-J

The shape of the edge-state band, as well as the particular frequency

The shape of the net dc voltage as a function of the excitation amplitude
indicates that our vortex ratchet behaves in a way very different from standard

that neutrinos have mass and mix. These experiments have yielded valuable
information on the mixing angles and on the mass differences of the three
eigenstates but cannot determine the scale of the neutrino mass, which is fixed
by the lightest neutrino mass eigenvalue. This can only be directly determined
by kinematic measurementsor by the observation and measurement of the
neutrinoless double-beta decay (NDBD) half-life. The CUORE experiment is
designed with a sensitivity capable of probing the range indicated by
oscillation experiments. It consists of an array of 988, 750 g, TeO2 bolometers
operating at 8 to 10 mK and arranged in a cylindrical geometry of 19 towers
hanging on the bottom of the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator. Each
tower consists of 13 4-detector modules for a total of 52 bolometers. One such
tower has been successfully constructed and is now operated in the Gran Sasso
Laboratory as a test experiment, and also as an independent NDBD experiment
called CUORICINO. In fact, the 3 year half-life sensitivity of CUORICINO for
NDBD decay of 130Te is 6.1E24 years. Thus far the CUORICINO data demonstrate
the technical feasibility of the expanded CUORE array while showing what and
where the sources of background are and how to reduce them. A background
reduction to 0.01 counts/keV/kg/y in the NDBD energy region is therefore
possible. This would allow the full CUORE array to achieve a 5-year sensitivity
of the order of 30 meV on the effective neutrino mass. Another order of
magnitude reduction (corresponding to a sensitivity of about 15 meV) will
present a real challenge, but is also possible. The CUORE experiment will be
installed in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Assergi, Italy.

Higgs boson is contained in the Goldstones from this breaking. All of the
interactions on the IR brane preserve the global symmetries that protect the
Higgs mass, but a radiative potential is generated through loops that stretch
to the UV brane where there are explicit SU(5) violating boundary conditions.
Like the original littlest Higgs, this model exhibits collective breaking in
that two interactions must be turned on in order to generate a Higgs potential.
In AdS space, however, collective breaking does not appear in coupling
constants directly but rather in the choice of UV brane boundary conditions. We

sensitive to the octant of $\theta_{23}$ and to the type of the neutrino mass

resolve the so-called $\theta_{23}$- and sign($\Delta m^2_{31}$)-parameter
degeneracies in LBL data. As a consequence it becomes possible to distinguish
the normal from the inverted neutrino mass ordering at $2\sigma$ CL from a
combined LBL+ATM analysis if $\sin^2 2\theta_{13} \gtrsim 0.02$. The potential
to identify the true values of $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ and the CP-phase

Saturation occurs through black hole production on the IR brane, which is in
QCD production of a nonlinear pion field soliton of a Born-Infeld action in the
hadron collision, that decays into free pions.

Polchinski-Strassler. Black hole production in AdS was responsible for power
law behaviour of the total QCD cross section. Using the simplest
self-consistent gravity dual assumption, that cut-off $AdS_5$ is supplemented
by a 5d space $X_5$ of effective ``average'' size much larger than the scale of
$AdS_5$, we find an energy behaviour just before the saturation of the
Froissart bound that is $\sigma_{tot} \sim s^{1/n}= s^{1/11}\simeq s^{0.0909}$.
It comes from the solution of the Laplacean on $AdS_{d+1}\times X_{\bar{d}}$
behaving like $1/r^n=1/r^{2(d-1)+\bar{d}}= 1/r^{11}$. We argue that this should
be present in real QCD as well, as string corrections to the dual scattering
are small, and should onset at about $N_c^2 M_{1, glueball}\sim 10 GeV$.
Experimentally, one found the ``soft Pomeron'' behaviour, $\sigma_{tot}\sim
s^{0.093(2)}$, that onsets at about $ 9 GeV$, that was later argued to be
replaced by the unitarized Froissart + reaction-dependent constant behaviour.
We argue that the soft Pomeron and the dual behaviour represent the same
physics, creation of an effective field theory ``soliton''-like structure
(=black hole), that then decays, and so they have to be taken seriously. We
thus have an experimental prediction of string theory, literally counting the
extra dimensions.

to present a non-technical introduction to derived categories of sheaves on
varieties, including some important results like:
  -- the description of the derived category of P^n;
  -- Serre duality;
  -- the Bondal-Orlov result about derived categories of varieties with ample
or antiample canonical class;
  -- the Mukai-Bondal-Orlov-Bridgeland criterion for equivalence;
  -- equivalences for K3 surfaces and abelian varieties;
  -- invariance of Hochschild homology and cohomology under derived
equivalence.

this model we assign independently to each edge the value zero with probability
$p$ and the value one with probability $1-p$. We denote by $T({\bf 0}, v)$ the
passage time from the origin to $v$ for $v\in {\bf R}^d$ and $$B(t)=\{v\in {\bf
R}^d: T({\bf 0}, v)\leq t\}{and} G(t)=\{v\in {\bf R}^d: ET({\bf 0}, v)\leq
t\}.$$ It is well known that if $p < p_c$, there exists a compact shape
$B_d\subset {\bf R}^d$ such that for all $\epsilon >0$ $$t B_d(1-\epsilon)
\subset {B(t)} \subset tB_d(1+\epsilon){and} G(t)(1-{\epsilon}) \subset {B(t)}
\subset G(t)(1+{\epsilon}) {eventually w.p.1.}$$ We denote the fluctuations of
$B(t)$ from $tB_d$ and $G(t)$ by &&F(B(t), tB_d)=\inf \{l:tB_d(1-{l\over
t})\subset B(t)\subset tB_d(1+{l\over t})\} && F(B(t),
G(t))=\inf\{l:G(t)(1-{l\over t})\subset B(t)\subset G(t)(1+{l\over t})\}.
  The means of the fluctuations $E[F(B(t), tB_d]$ and $E[F(B(t), G(t))]$ have
been conjectured ranging from divergence to non-divergence for large $d\geq 2$
by physicists. In this paper, we show that for all $d\geq 2$ with a high
probability, the fluctuations $F(B(t), G(t))$ and $F(B(t), tB_d)$ diverge with
a rate of at least $C \log t$ for some constant $C$.
  The proof of this argument depends on the linearity between the number of
pivotal edges of all minimizing paths and the paths themselves. This linearity
is also independently interesting.

group actions on a symplectic manifold, namely, foliation reduction, introduced
by Cartan, Marsden-Weinstein reduction, and optimal reduction, introduced by
the authors. When the action is free, proper, and admits a momentum map these
three approaches coincide. The goal of this paper is to study the general case
of a symplectic action that does not admit a momentum map and one needs to use
its natural generalization, a cylinder valued momentum map introduced by
Condevaux, Dazord, and Molino. In this case it will be shown that the three
reduced spaces mentioned above do not coincide, in general. More specifically,
the Marsden-Weinstein reduced spaces are not symplectic but Poisson and their
symplectic leaves are given by the optimal reduced spaces. Foliation reduction
produces a symplectic reduced space whose Poisson quotient by a certain Lie
group associated to the group of symmetries of the problem equals the
Marsden-Weinstein reduced space. We illustrate these constructions with
concrete examples, special emphasis being given to the reduction of a magnetic
cotangent bundle of a Lie group in the situation when the magnetic term ensures
the non-existence of the momentum map for the lifted action. The precise
relation of the cylinder valued momentum map with group valued momentum maps
for Abelian Lie groups is also given.

an horizontal plane using the Contact Dynamics method are presented. The final
shape of the deposit seems to depend only on the aspect ratio $a$ of the
columns; these results are in good agreement with previous experimental work.
In particular, the renormalised runout distance shows a power law dependence on
the aspect ratio $a$, which is incompatible with a simple friction model. The
dynamics of the collapse is shown to be mostly controlled by the free fall of
the column. The energy dissipation at the base of the column can be described
simply by a coefficient of restitution. Hence the energy available for the
sideways flow is proportional to the initial potential energy $E_0$. The
dissipation process within the flow is well approximated by basal friction,
contrary to the behaviour of the runout distance. The mass ejected sideways is
showned to play a determining role in the spreading process. As $a$ increases,
the same fraction of initial potential energy $E_0$ drives more mass against
friction. This additional dissipation give a possible explanation for power-law
dependence of the runout distance on $a$. Beyond the frictional properties of
the material, we show that the flow characteristics strongly depend on the
early dynamics of the collapse. We propose a new scaling for the runout
distance that matches the data well, is compatible with a friction model, and
provide a qualitative explanation to the column collapse phenomenology.

treatment guidelines applied in Brazil. However, the model does not intend to
fit the data with any acceptable degree of accuracy since uncertainties on the

limits on the practical implications of our model from which only orders of
magnitude and some qualitative effects can be deduced. So, this paper intends
to provide a conceptual and mechanistic understanding of the possible long term
effects of treatment on the dynamics of HIV transmission.
  According to the model, the effect of the treatment depends on the level of
sexual activity of the subpopulations considered, being more pronounced on the
subpopulations with the highest sexual activity levels. Also, inefficient
treatment can be prejudicial depending on the level of sexual activity and on
the capacity to provide adequate treatment coverages to the population

estimate what the state originally was. Simultaneously, the measurement has a
destructive effect on a measured quantum state which is reflected by the
decrease of the output fidelity. We show for any $d$-level system that quantum
non-demolition (QND) measurement controlled by a suitably prepared ancilla is a
measurement in which the decrease of the output fidelity is minimal. The ratio
between the estimation fidelity and the output fidelity can be continuously
controlled by the preparation of the ancilla. Different measurement strategies
on the ancilla are also discussed. Finally, we propose a feasible scheme of
such a measurement for atomic and optical 2-level systems based on basic
controlled-NOT gate.

Heisenberg chains. Both the bilinear chain and the bilinear-biquadratic chain
are considered. Due to the SU(2) symmetry, the negativity can be determined by
two correlators, which greatly facilitate the study of entanglement properties.
Analytical results of negativity are obtained in the bilinear model up to four
spins and the two-spin bilinear-biquadratic model, and numerical results of
negativity are presented. We determine the threshold temperature before which
the thermal state is doomed to be entangled.
