should appear as dwarf galaxies if their star formation is not suppressed
significantly. We here investigate to which extent the cosmological
UV-background photo-evaporates baryons out of halos of dwarf galaxies, and
thereby limits their cooling and star formation rates. Assuming a Haardt &
Madau UV-background with reionisation at redshift z=6, our samples of simulated
galaxies show that halos with masses below a characteristic mass of M_c(z=0) =
6.5 x 10^9 h^{-1} M_sun are baryon-poor, but in general not completely empty,
because baryons that are in the condensed cold phase or are already locked up
in stars resist evaporation. In halos with mass M < M_c, we find that
photo-heating suppresses further cooling of gas. The redshift and UV-background
dependent characteristic mass M_c(z) can be understood from the equilibrium
temperature between heating and cooling at a characteristic overdensity of
\delta ~ 1000. If a halo is massive enough to compress gas to this density
despite the presence of the UV background, gas is free to `enter' the condensed
phase and cooling continues in the halo, otherwise it stalls. By analysing the
mass accretion histories of dwarf galaxies in voids, we show that they can
build up a significant amount of condensed mass at early times before the epoch
of reionisation. Later on, the amount of mass in this phase remains roughly
constant, but the masses of the dark matter halos continue to increase.

overflowing its Roche Lobe and accreting onto the compact primary, probably a
black hole. This picture predicts an orbital period of $\sim10$ days for
different black hole mass, which can be tested by future observations.

temperature (both M3+/-0.5). Based on kinematics, signatures of accretion, and
location on an H-R diagram, we conclude that St 34 is a classical T Tauri star
belonging to the Taurus-Auriga T Association. Surprisingly, however, neither
component of the binary shows LiI 6708 A, absorption, the most universally
accepted criterion for establishing stellar youth. In this uniquely known
instance, the accretion disk appears to have survived longer than the lithium
depletion timescale. We speculate that the long-lived accretion disk is a
consequence of the sub-AU separation companion tidally inhibiting, though not
preventing, circumstellar accretion. Comparisons with pre-main sequence
evolutionary models imply, for each component of St 34, a mass of 0.37+/-0.08
Msun and an isochronal age of 8+/-3 Myr, which is much younger than the
predicted lithium depletion timescale of ~ 25 Myr. Although a distance 38%
closer than that of Taurus-Auriga or a hotter temperature scale could reconcile
this discrepancy at 21-25 Myr, similar discrepancies in other systems and the
implications of an extremely old accreting Taurus-Auriga member suggest instead
a possible problem with evolutionary models. Regardless, the older age implied
by St 34's depleted lithium abundance is the first compelling evidence for a
substantial age spread in this region. Additionally, since St 34's coeval
co-members with early M spectral types would likewise fail the lithium test for
youth, current membership lists may be incomplete.

current SFR in the Cartwheel. The revised value is 18 Msun/yr, which is a
factor of 4 lower than the value reported previously, but is in good agreement

stress the necessity to do fits of this type carefully, and in particular to
include the contribution from heavy flavours to the inclusive structure

produce dipole cross-sections growing quite strongly at small x, while DGLAP
based fits have valence-like, or even negative, small-x gluons as inputs.
However, I also find that the gluon distributions obtained from the dipole fits
are much too small to match onto the conventional DGLAP gluons at high Q^2,

for this discrepancy is found to be the large approximations made in converting

designed only for asymptotically small x. The shortcomings in this step affect
the accuracy of the extracted dipole cross-sections in terms of size and shape,

regularized two-loop self-energy integrals. A convenient basis for these
functions is given by the integrals obtained at the end of O.V. Tarasov's
recurrence relation algorithm. The program computes the values of all of these
basis functions, for arbitrary input masses and external momentum. When
analytical expressions in terms of polylogarithms are available, they are used.
Otherwise, the evaluation proceeds by a Runge-Kutta integration of the coupled
first-order differential equations for the basis integrals, using the external
momentum invariant as the independent variable. The starting point of the
integration is provided by known analytic expressions at (or near) zero
external momentum. The code is written in C, and may be linked from C, C++, or

polygonal Markov fields with V-shaped nodes. The first of these dynamics is
based on the dynamic construction of consistent polygonal fields, as presented
in the original articles by Arak (1982) and Arak and Surgailis (1989, 1991),

second dynamics leads to a graphical construction in the spirit of Fernandez,

finite window from the infinite-volume limit. This algorithm seems difficult to
implement, yet its value lies in that it allows for theoretical analysis of
thermodynamic limit behaviour of length-interacting polygonal fields. The
results thus obtained include the uniqueness and exponential $\alpha$-mixing of

subquotient of the maximal pro-p abelian unramified completely split at p
extension of a certain pro-p Kummer extension of a cyclotomic field that
contains all p-power roots of unity. The third is the quotient of an Eisenstein
ideal in an ordinary Hecke algebra of Hida by the square of the Eisenstein
ideal and the element given by the pth Hecke operator minus one. For the
relationship between the latter two objects, we employ the work of Ohta, in
which he considered a certain Galois action on an inverse limit of cohomology
groups to reestablish the Main Conjecture (for p at least 5) in the spirit of
the Mazur-Wiles proof. For the relationship between the former two objects, we
construct an analogue to the global reciprocity map for extensions with
restricted ramification. These relationships, and a computation in the Hecke
algebra, allow us to prove an earlier conjecture of McCallum and the author on
the surjectivity of a pairing formed from the cup product for p < 1000. We give
one other application, determining the structure of Selmer groups of the

approximately obtained from a universal set by a simple scaling. In an
oscillator mean-field approach, V_{low k} reproduces satisfactorily many
features of the single-particle and single-hole spectra on closed-shell nuclei,
in particular through remarkably good splittings between spin-orbit partners on
top of harmonic oscillator closures. The main deficiencies of pure two-nucleon
interactions are associated with binding energies and with the failure to
ensure magicity for the extruder-intruder closures. Here, calculations
including three-nucleon interactions are most needed. V_{low k} makes it
possible to define directly a meaningful unperturbed monopole Hamiltonian, for
which the inclusion of three-nucleon forces is tractable.

PRIMUS linear accelerator. The flattening filter has a radius smaller than the
primary collimator one, creating inhomogeneities that affect large fields in
areas far from the collimator axis, and asymmetric fields with large offset.
Profiles and absolute dose have been measured in fields with two jaws at
maximal position (20 cm) and the other two at maximal overtravel (10 cm.),
corresponding to 10 x 10 fields with extreme offset. Profiles have a remarkable
gradient decreasing towards the beam edge, making these fields unsuitable for
treatments. Results show that the design of the primary collimator and
flattening filter assembly has direct consequences in homogeneity. This can
have clinical consequences for treatments involving fields that include these
inhomogeneous areas. Comparisons with the treatment planning system (Philips
Pinnacle) calculations, that computes under the hypotheses of a uniformly
flattened beam, result in severe discrepancies.

reaction occurs at a sharp front which separates reactants from less dense

new buoyancy which fuels an accelerating plume head. When the head has grown to
a critical size, it detaches from the upwelling conduit, forming an
accelerating, buoyant vortex ring. This vortex is analogous to a rising smoke
ring. A second-generation head then develops at the point of

larger than the $\pi$-gate operational time. Therefore, this indicates that,
during the decoherence time, it is possible to perform some thousands of
