  NGC 4258","Rewritten to highlight main result; remarks added to elucidate common
  misconception regarding the impact of gravitational redshift on a maser
  line's gain and saturation; 6 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  NGC 4258 is well known for its 22 GHz water maser features that appear to
reside in a thin Keplerian disk orbiting at R_0=0.13 pc. The influence of
gravitational redshift on the level of maser saturation and the line strength
and width of systemic water maser emission is studied. The effective
gravitational velocity shift along the gain path through the disk amounts to
about twice the thermal velocity width of H2O molecules at 500 K for a masing
ring of thickness 0.2R_0. This GR induced frequency shift has a sign opposite
to the shift caused by the projected velocity difference vector of Keplerian
motion on the blue side of the systemic maser emission and has the same sign on
the red systemic side. Consequently, the negative optical depth that a line
photon sees as it traverses the masing disk along a path of minimal Keplerian
velocity gradient is larger on the blue side. Note that one is not concerned
here with an overall shift in the maser spectrum caused by the fact that the
masing ring as a whole is located in the black hole's potential well, i.e., it
is the change in the gravitational potential along the gain path that matters.
It is found, for a Schwarzschild metric, that saturation is enhanced
(suppressed) for systemic blue-shifted (red-shifted) maser features by
gravitational redshift of line photons. Approaching peak flux systemic features
are, on average, brighter, due to saturation, and wider (~2 km/s), due to
rebroadening, than their receding counterparts (~1 km/s). The effects are
consistent with observations that span several years, i.e., over periods longer
than needed for disk material to move through the systemic emission region.
Further confirmation of this effect can follow by combining all available
systemic 22 GHz data over the past two decades (abridged).

drops continuously from 80 kpc towards the centre, and is locally single phase.
We measure a metallicity profile which declines outwards with a value 0.8 Z_sun
in the centre, dropping to 0.35 Z_sun at larger radius, which we interpret as a
superposition of cluster gas and a dense interstellar medium (ISM) in the
central galaxy. Although the temperature profile suggests that conduction is
not efficient, the ISM and intra-cluster medium seem not to have mixed. The
entropy profile declines continuously towards the centre, in agreement with
recent results on groups and clusters. The radio source appears to have had
some effect in terms of gas heating, as seen in the small scale (~10 kpc)
entropy core, and the asymmetric hard emission on the same scale.

most primitive of all chondrite types and must have preserved solar nebula
records largely unchanged. We have analyzed the oxygen and magnesium isotopes
in a range of the CR constituents of different formation temperatures and ages,
including refractory inclusions and chondrules of various types. The results
provide new constraints on the time variation of the oxygen isotopic
composition of the inner (<5 AU) solar nebula - the region where refractory
inclusions and chondrules most likely formed. A chronology based on the decay
of short-lived 26Al (t1/2 ~ 0.73 Ma) indicates that the inner solar nebula gas
was 16O-rich when refractory inclusions formed, but less than 0.8 Ma later, gas
in the inner solar nebula became 16O-poor and this state persisted at least
until CR chondrules formed ~1-2 Myr later. We suggest that the inner solar
nebula became 16O-poor because meter-size icy bodies, which were enriched in
17,18O due to isotopic self-shielding during the ultraviolet photo dissociation
of CO in the protosolar molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk, agglomerated
outside the snowline, drifted rapidly towards the Sun, and evaporated at the
snowline. This led to significant enrichment in 16O-depleted water, which then
spread through the inner solar system. Astronomical studies of the spatial
and/or temporal variations of water abundance in protoplanetary disks may
clarify these processes.

a mean period that is consistent with its metallicity, the mean period of the

diffuse background in which the observed flux is dominated by a ~ 10^6 K
thermal plasma located in a 100-300 pc diameter bubble surrounding the Sun, but
has significant contributions from a very patchy Galactic halo. Halo emission
provides about 11% of the total observed flux and is responsible for half of
the H I anticorrelation. The remainder of the anticorrelation is presumably
produced by displacement of disk H I by the varying extent of the local hot
bubble (LHB). The ROSAT R1 and R2 bands used for this work had the unique
spatial resolution and statistical precision required for separating the halo
and local components, but provide little spectral information. Some consistency
checks had been made with older observations at lower X-ray energies, but we
have made a careful investigation of the extent to which the model is supported
by existing sounding rocket data in the Be (73-111 eV) and B bands (115-188 eV)
where the sensitivities to the model are qualitatively different from the ROSAT
bands. We conclude that the two-component model is well supported by the
low-energy data. We find that these combined observations of the local
component may be consistent with single-temperature thermal emission models in
collisional ionization equilibrium if depleted abundances are assumed. However,
different model implementations give significantly different results, offering
little support for the conclusion that the astrophysical situation is so
simple.

If the spectral dips of a large enough sample of HII regions are well resolved
in frequency space, the distribution of line depth and equivalent width in

morphologies of early-to-mid Hubble-types, and many show transformations
between their rest-frame UV-optical morphologies. Galaxies at z=2.3 have
compact and irregular morphologies with no clearly evident Hubble-sequence
candidates. The mean galaxy size grows from z=2.3 to 1 by 40%, and the density
of galaxies larger than 3 kpc increases by 7 times. At z=1, the size-luminosity
distribution is broadly consistent with that of local galaxies, with passive
evolution. However, galaxies at z=2.3 are smaller than the large present-day
galaxies, and must continue to grow in size and stellar mass. We have measured
the galaxies' UV-optical ICD, which quantifies differences in morphology and
the relative amount of on-going star-formation. The mean and scatter in
galaxies' total colors and ICD increase from z=2.3 to 1. At z=1 many galaxies
with large ICD are spirals, with a few irregular systems. Few z=2.3 galaxies
have high ICD, and those that do are actively merging. We interpret this as
evidence for the presence of older and more diverse stellar populations at z=1
that are not generally present at z>2. We conclude that the star-formation
histories of galaxies at z>2 are dominated by discrete, recurrent bursts, which
quickly homogenize the galaxies' stellar content, and are possibly associated
with mergers. The increase in the stellar-population diversification by z<1.4
implies that merger-induced starbursts occur less frequently than at higher
redshifts, and more quiescent star-forming modes dominate. This transition
coincides with the emergence of Hubble-sequence galaxies. [Abridged]

to study the thermal emission from isolated neutron stars. Detailed XMM and
Chandra observations revealed a number of features in the X-ray pulse profile,
like asymmetry, energy dependence, and possible evolution of the pulse profile
over a time scale of months or years. Here we show that these characteristics
may be explained by a patchy surface temperature distribution, which is
expected if the magnetic field has a complex structure in which higher order
multipoles contribute together with the dipole. We reconsider these effects
from a theoretical point of view, and discuss their implications to the
observational properties of thermally emitting neutron stars.

harder than the primary electron background and degrades due to synchrotron and

The fit is better than can be obtained with homogeneous injection and is
attributed to a minimum age threshold. Annihilating neutralinos can provide a
fair fit to the data if they have a mass just above 1/2 the mass of the $Z^o$

dimensionality dependent) matrix K containing certain correlations of the
transfer matrices. We first of all examine the assumptions made in the
derivation if the generalized DMPK and find that to a good approximation they
remain valid in 3D. We then evaluate the matrix K numerically for various
strength of the disorder and various system sizes. In the strong disorder limit
we find that K can be described by a simple model which, for a cubic system,
depends on a single parameter. We use this phenomenological model to
analytically evaluate the full distribution P(g) for Anderson insulators in 3D.

Afterwards, the evolution of the polarizability is measured. If such an
experiment is performed in the Terahertz-range it might provide valuable
information about the low-frequency dynamics in disordered systems. We treat
these dynamics in terms of a Brownian oscillator model and calculate the Kerr
effect response. It is shown that frequency-selective behaviour can be
expected. In the interesting case of underdamped vibrational motion we find
that the frequency-dependence of the phonon-damping can be determined from the

the properties of the physical singularities where the Kretschmann curvature
scalar is equal to the planckian value. Using a homogeneous approximation we
analyse the properties of the spacetime near a spacelike singularity in

pressureless dust and matter with ultrarelativistic isotropic pressure. We also

Evolution of the shape of the reconnected strings provides an upper bound on

reconnection of the D-strings is not classical but probabilistic. We show that

the VP scheme. The resultant truncated expressions (we call Gaussian smearing
formulae) consist mainly of Gaussian transforms of the local-field function,
the model-potential function and their derivatives, and so can be used to skip
calculations on path integrals in a concrete theory. As an application, the VP
expansion series of the VEV of a local exponential field in the sine- and
sinh-Gordon field theories is truncated and derived up to second order
equivalently by directly performing the VP scheme, by finishing ordinary
integrations in the Gaussian smearing formulae, and by borrowing Feynman
diagrammatic technique, respectively. Furthermore, the one-order VP results of
the VEV in the two-dimensional sine- and sinh-Gordon field theories are
numerically calculated and compared with the exact results conjectured by
Lukyanov, Zamolodchikov $et al.$, or with the one-order perturbative results

consider three asymptotic regimes of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\tau$ for
which the effective evolution of observables on the small system becomes
continuous over suitable macroscopic time scales $T$ and whose generator can be
computed: the weak coupling limit regime $\lambda\ra 0$, $\tau=1$, the regime
$\tau\ra 0$, $\lambda^2\tau \ra 0$ and the critical case $\lambda^2\tau=1$,
$\tau\ra 0$. The first two regimes are perturbative in nature and the effective
generators they determine is such that a non-trivial invariant sub-algebra of
observables naturally emerges. The third asymptotic regime goes beyond the
perturbative regime and provides an effective dynamics governed by a general
Lindblad generator naturally constructed from the interaction Hamiltonian.
Conversely, this result shows that one can attach to any Lindblad generator a
repeated quantum interactions model whose asymptotic effective evolution is
generated by this Lindblad operator.

physics through APNC observables. The addition of an isoscalar-isovector
coupling constant to the effective Lagrangian generates a wide range of values
for the neutron skin of heavy nuclei without compromising the success of the
model in reproducing well constrained nuclear observables. Earlier studies have
suggested that the use of isotopic ratios of APNC observables may eliminate
their sensitivity to atomic structure. This leaves nuclear structure
uncertainties as the main impediment for identifying physics beyond the
standard model. We establish that uncertainties in the neutron skin of heavy
nuclei are at present too large to measure isotopic ratios to better than the
0.1% accuracy required to test the standard model. However, we argue that such
uncertainties will be significantly reduced by the upcoming measurement of the
neutron radius in 208Pb at the Jefferson Laboratory.

to the system consisting of a discrete set of point-like vortices interacting
in plane by a short range potential. A field-theoretical formalism is developed
for describing the continuous version of this system. The action functional can
be written in the Bogomolnyi form (emphasizing the role of Self-Duality of the
asymptotic states) but the minimum energy is no more topological and the
asymptotic structures appear to be non-stationary, which is a major difference
with respect to traditional topological vortex solutions. Versions of this

complexity, typically characterized by strongly nonlinear evolution dynamics.
The systems under investigation have many degrees of freedom - which makes them
complicated - and feature nonlinear interactions of several different
components taking place on a vast range of time-space scales - which makes them
complex. Such systems evolve under the action of macroscopic driving (typically
the solar heating) and modulating (e.g. the Earth's rotation and gravitation)
agents. The most comprehensive example is the entire climatic system. The
description of the macroscopic dynamics of environmental systems is based on
the systematic use of dominant balances derived on a phenomenological basis in
order to specialize the dynamical equations. Such balances are suitable classes
of approximate solutions of the evolution equations which represent a
reasonably good approximation to the actual observed fields when sufficiently
large spatial or temporal averages are considered. Actually, different balances
have to be considered depending on the time and space scales we are focusing
our interest on. Such an approach reflects the fundamentally
heuristic-inductive nature of the scientific research in environmental
sciences, where the traditional reductionistic scientific attitude is not
always effective. In order to exemplify this procedure, we consider the very
relevant case of the motion of the fluids that permit the existence of life on
the Earth, air and water: the so-called geophysical fluids.
