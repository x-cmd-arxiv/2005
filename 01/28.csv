fluctuations depend on the unknown nature of dark matter, the determination of
which is one of the biggest challenges in present-day science. Here we report
supercomputer simulations of the concordance cosmological model, which assumes
neutralino dark matter (at present the preferred candidate), and find that the

gamma-rays (from particle-particle annihilation).

mass companion. By combining new speckle observations with old and new radial
velocity measurements we find that the orbit is highly eccentric with

$0.9\pm0.1 {\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.5\pm0.1 {\rm M}_\odot$, for the primary and
secondary, respectively. From high resolution spectra we derive a new $T_{\rm

previous estimates. However, the new spectroscopic distance differs by only
5.8% to the distance derived by parallax measurement of the Hipparcos satellite
and thus the stellar parameters are presumably more realistic than older
determinations. We derive a somewhat higher value for the metallicity of
$[Fe/H]=-0.16\pm0.07$. EK Dra turns out to be one of the few nearby young stars
which will evolve similar to the sun. The precise radial velocity measurements
taken in the course of this program also allows us to shed more light on to the
activity of this star. In 2001 and 2002 we find a periodic signal of the radial
velocity variations with a period of $2.767\pm0.005$ days which we interpret as
the rotation period. This signal vanishes in 2003. However the signal can be
recovered if only the spectra in which the photospheric lines are asymmetric
are used. On the other hand, we do not find a close correlation between the
asymmetry of photospheric lines and the radial velocity.

last two categories, up to 6 objects are suspected false positives of the
photometric transit detection. Finally 2 objects are unsolved cases that
deserve further observations. Our study illustrates the wide variety of cases
that can mimic photometric planetary transits, and the importance of
spectroscopic follow-up. Multi-fiber capacities and an optimized follow-up

friction, into the inner regions of triaxial galaxies on a time much shorter

a King model profile; iii) GC-GC collisions have a negligible effect with

orbital energy dissipation due to the tidal interaction is of the same order of
that caused by dynamical friction; v) complex sub-structures like ""ripples"" and

We use these weaken theories to construct expressions for the conditional

that the logarithm of the ratio $R_{ij}(\tau) \equiv K_i(\tau)/K_j(\tau)$ is

in opposite phase from that of He I 4471. These results suggest that the model

compatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. Using numerical
simulations of disc-galaxy mergers, we find that the stellar orbits in the

torn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first close
passage and put on outgoing trajectories. The elongated orbits, combined with
the steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain the

however, by a small, anomalous, Doppler frequency drift that can be interpreted
as an acceleration of (8.74 +/- 1.33) x 10^{-8} cm/s^2 directed toward the Sun.
We investigate the possibility that this anomaly could be due to a drag on the
spacecraft from their passing through the interplanetary medium. Although this
mechanism is an appealing one, the existing Pioneer radiometric data would
require an unexpectedly high mass density of interplanetary dust for this
mechanism to work. Further, the magnitude of the density would have to be
nearly constant at distances ~ 20-70 AU. Therefore, it appears that such an
explanation is very unlikely, if not ruled out. Despite this, the measured
frequency drift by itself places a directly-measured, model-independent limit
of \lessim 3 x 10^{-19} g/cm^3 on the mass density of interplanetary dust in
the outer(~20-70 AU) solar system. Lower experimental limits can be placed if
one presumes a model that varies with distance. An example is the limit \lessim
6 x 10^{-20} g/cm^3 obtained for the model with an axially-symmetric density
distribution that falls off as the inverse of the distance. We emphasize that

arises in the effective action of itinerant ferromagnets when the full SU(2)
symmetry is present. We explicitly demonstrate that dynamical critical exponent
of the theory with the Berry term is $z=2 +{\rm O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the sense of
$\epsilon$ expansion, as previously discovered in the Ising limit. It appears,
however, that the universality class at the interacting fixed point is not the
same. We point out that even though the critical theory in the Ising limit can
be obtained by the standard Hertz-Millis approach, the Heisenberg limit is
expected to be different. We also calculate the exact electron Green functions
$G(x,t=0)$ and $G(x=0,t)$ near the transition in a range of temperature, which
can be used for experimental signatures of the associated critical points.

continuous doping of CoO_{2} planes with either electrons or holes, spanning a
wide range from the charge-ordered insulator at 50% electron doping (x=0) to
the undoped band insulator (x=0.5), and further towards the heavily hole-doped
metallic state. This continuous doping is clearly manifested in the behavior of
thermoelectric power which exhibits a spectacular divergence with approaching
x=0.5, where it reaches large absolute values and abruptly changes its sign. At
low temperatures, the homogeneous distribution of doped carriers in GBCO
becomes unstable, and both the magnetic and transport properties point to an
intriguing nanoscopic phase separation. We also find that throughout the
composition range the magnetic behavior in GBCO is governed by a delicate
balance between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions,
which can be easily affected by temperature, doping, or magnetic field,
bringing about FM-AF transitions and a giant magnetoresistance (MR) phenomenon.

observed to grow only linearly in the number of variables, for a given

constraints imposed by the multiple-access channel, and secondly, individual
constraints imposed by each users' error control code. A-posteriori probability
computation for the first set of constraints is prohibitively complex for all
but a small number of users. Several lower complexity approaches have been
proposed in the literature. One class of methods is based on linear filtering
(e.g. LMMSE). A more recent approach is to compute approximations to the
posterior probabilities by marginalising over a subset of sequences (list
detection). Most of the list detection methods are restricted to non-singular
systems. In this paper, we introduce a transformation that permits application
of standard tree-search methods to underdetermined systems. We find that the
resulting tree-search based receiver outperforms existing methods.

pulse shapes are adapted to the second order statistics of the WSSUS channel.
Even though the problem has been addressed by many authors analytical insights
are rather limited. First we show that the problem is equivalent to the pure
state channel fidelity in quantum information theory. Next we present a new
approach where the original optimization functional is related to an eigenvalue
problem for a pseudo differential operator by utilizing unitary representations
of the Weyl--Heisenberg group.A local approximation of the operator for
underspread channels is derived which implicitly covers the concepts of pulse
scaling and optimal phase space displacement. The problem is reformulated as a
differential equation and the optimal pulses occur as eigenstates of the
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. Furthermore this operator--algebraic approach
is extended to provide exact solutions for different classes of scattering
environments.

consequence of energy conservation and takes place even at low energies. We
demonstrate that in all these reactions there is a common suppression mechanism

enhanced resolution of higher Fock states by nuclei, or an effective energy
loss that rises linearly with energy. Our calculations agree with data.

establish the cosmological significance of a wimp discovery, their density must

cosmology and astrophysics. We provide examples of dark matter models where
nearly identical detector or collider signals correspond to very different

heavy, at least at the order of 10^9 GeV, but the gauginos, Higgsinos, and one
of the neutral Higgs bosons remain below a TeV. Here we further split the split
supersymmetry by taking the Higgsino mass parameter \mu to be very large. In
this case, the \mu problem is avoided and we keep the wino as a dark matter
candidate. A crude gauge coupling unification is still preserved. Dark matter
signals and collider phenomenology are discussed in this \mu-split SUSY
scenario. The most interesting dark matter signal is the annihilation into
monochromatic photons. In colliders, chargino-pair and the associated
chargino-neutralino production cross sections have a certain ratio due to gauge
couplings, and the chargino has long decays.

singular values are exactly the values m/n with 2<=n<=N, m = 1,2... and m/n is

unique irreducible S_N-module of singular polynomials for the singular value

Murphy's (J. Alg. 69(1981), 287-297) results on the eigenvalues of the Murphy
elements, the problem of existence of singular polynomials is first restricted
to the isotype of a partition of N (corresponding to an irreducible
representation of S_N) such that (n/gcd(m,n)) divides t+1 for each part t of
the partition except the last one. Then by arguments involving nonsymmetric
Jack polynomials it is shown that the assumption that the second part of the

shows that the singular polynomials are exactly those already determined.

function, even if the range of applicability of the theory is much wider. In
the limit of large damping we look for quasi-periodic solutions which have the
same frequency vector of the forcing term, and we study their analyticity
properties in the inverse of the damping coefficient. We find that already the
case of periodic forcing terms is non-trivial, as the solution is not analytic
in a neighbourhood of the origin: it turns out to be Borel-summable. In the
case of quasi-periodic forcing terms we need Renormalization Group techniques

show the existence of a summation criterion of the series in this case also,
but, however, this can not be interpreted as Borel summability.

curvature and a non parallel Ricci tensor, except for the cylindric one. Thus,
it appears a natural link between them and the Derdzinski metrics which are
warped product and classify a family of Riemannian manifolds. These two
families actually differ by conformal transformations. Moreover, we are
interested in the multiplicity problem of the pseudo-cylindric metrics in

allows us to give new bounds for global estimates. Finally, we examine the

understanding the mechanism of flow transition from laminar flow to turbulent
flow. In this method, it is demonstrated that the transition to turbulence
depends on the relative magnitudes of the transverse gradient of the total
mechanical energy which amplifies the disturbance and the energy loss from
viscous friction which damps the disturbance, for given imposed disturbance.
For a given flow geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of the
function K (a function standing for the ratio of the gradient of total
mechanical energy in the transverse direction to the rate of energy loss due to
viscous friction in the streamwise direction) in the flow field is larger than
a certain critical value, it is expected that instability would occur for some
initial disturbances. In this paper, using the energy gradient analysis, the
equation for calculating the energy gradient function K for plane Couette flow
is derived. The result indicates that K reaches the maximum at the moving
walls. Thus, the fluid layer near the moving wall is the most dangerous
position to generate initial oscillation at sufficient high Re for given same
level of normalized perturbation in the domain. The critical value of K at
turbulent transition, which is observed from experiments, is about 370 for
plane Couette flow when two walls move in opposite directions (anti-symmetry).
This value is about the same as that for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe
Poiseuille flow (385-389). Therefore, it is concluded that the critical value
of K at turbulent transition is about 370-389 for wall-bounded parallel shear
flows which include both pressure (symmetrical case) and shear driven flows
(anti-symmetrical case).

  International Conference on Nonlinear Science, Singapore, 30 June -- 2 July,
  2004. http://www.ddap3.nus.edu.sg",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  A new universal theory for flow instability and turbulent transition is
proposed in this study. Flow instability and turbulence transition have been
challenging subjects for fluid dynamics for a century. The critical condition
of turbulent transition from theory and experiments differs largely from each
other for Poiseuille flows. In this paper, a new mechanism of flow instability
and turbulence transition is presented for parallel shear flows and the energy
gradient theory of hydrodynamic instability is proposed. It is stated that the
total energy gradient in the transverse direction and that in the streamwise
direction of the main flow dominate the disturbance amplification or decay. A
new dimensionless parameter K for characterizing flow instability is proposed
for wall bounded shear flows, which is expressed as the ratio of the energy
gradients in the two directions. It is thought that flow instability should
first occur at the position of Kmax which may be the most dangerous position.
This speculation is confirmed by Nishioka et al's experimental data. Comparison
with experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow
indicates that the proposed idea is really valid. It is found that the
turbulence transition takes place at a critical value of Kmax of about 385 for
both plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, below which no turbulence
will occur regardless the disturbance. More studies show that the theory is
also valid for plane Couette flows and Taylor-Couette flows between concentric
rotating cylinders.

are anchored to generalized Arnol'd tongues, parameter regions where driven
nonlinear classical systems exhibit mode-locking. A hierarchy for the rational
numbers known as the Farey Tree provides an ordering of the Arnol'd tongues and
hence of experimentally observed accelerator modes.

Kholmetskii","On momentum and energy of a non-radiating electromagnetic field","32 pages, 7 figures; changed content of section 4",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  This paper inspects more closely the problem of the momentum and energy of a
bound (non-radiating) electromagnetic (EM) field. It has been shown that for an
isolated system of non-relativistic mechanically free charged particles a
transformation of mechanical to EM momentum and vice versa occurs in accordance
with the requirement PG=const, where PG is the canonical momentum. If such a
system contains bound charges, fixed on insulators then, according to the
assumption of a number of authors, a so-called ""hidden"" momentum can contribute
into the total momentum of the system. The problem of ""hidden momentum"" (pro
and contra) is also examined in the paper, as well as the law of conservation
of total energy for different static configurations of the system ""magnetic
dipole plus charged particle"". Analyzing two expressions for electromagnetic
momentum of a bound EM field, qA and the Poynting expression, we emphasize that
they coincide with each other for quasi-static configurations, but give a
discrepancy for rapid dynamical processes. We conclude that neither the first,
nor the second expressions provide a continuous implementation of the momentum
conservation law. Finally, we consider the energy flux in a bound EM field,
using the Umov vector. It has been shown that Umov vector can be directly
derived from Maxwell equations. A new form of the momentum-energy tensor, which
explicitly unites the mechanical and EM masses, has been proposed.

Algebra of the genetic code is proposed. Here, the principal partitions of the
genetic code table were obtained as equivalent classes of quotient subspaces of
the genetic code vector space over the Galois field of the four DNA bases. The
new algebraic structure shows strong connections among algebraic relationships,
codon assignment and physicochemical properties of amino acids. Moreover, a
distance function defined between codons in the Lie algebra was demonstrated to
have a linear behavior respect to physical variables such as the mean of amino
acids energy in proteins. It was also noticed that the distance between wild
type and mutant codons approach smaller values in mutational variants of four
genes, i.e, human phenylalanine hydroxylase, human beta-globin, HIV-1 protease
and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. These results strongly suggest that
deterministic rules in genetic code origin must be involved.

that enable cells to process information and respond to external signals.
Theoretical studies often describe these interactions using continuous,
stochastic, or logical approaches. We propose a new modeling framework for gene
regulatory networks, that combines the intuitive appeal of a qualitative
description of gene states with a high flexibility in incorporating
stochasticity in the duration of cellular processes. We apply our methods to
the regulatory network of the segment polarity genes, thus gaining novel
insights into the development of gene expression patterns. For example, we show
that very short synthesis and decay times can perturb the wild type pattern. On
the other hand, separation of timescales between pre- and posttranslational
processes and a minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild type
expression pattern regardless of fluctuations.

correlations', which are hypothetical violations of Bell/CHSH inequalities that
are stronger than quantum mechanics allows, yet weak enough to prohibit
faster-than-light communication. It is shown that the existence of maximally
superstrong correlated bits implies that all distributed computations can be
performed with a trivial amount of communication, i.e. with one bit. If one
believes that Nature does not allow such a computational 'free lunch', then the
result in the Letter gives a reason why superstrong correlation are indeed not
possible.

trapping (VSCPT) in a beam of metastable neon atoms. The atomic momentum
distribution resulting from the interaction with counterpropagating sigma_+ and
sigma_- radiation which couples a J_g=2 <-> J_e=1 transition is measured via
the transversal beam profile. This transition exhibits a stable VSCPT dark
state formed by the two |J=2,m=+/-1> states, and a metastable dark state
containing the |J=2,m=+/-2> and |J=2,m=0> states. The dynamics of the formation
and decay of stable and metastable dark states is studied experimentally and
numerically and the finite lifetime of the metastable dark state is
experimentally observed. We compare the measured distribution with a numerical
solution of the master equation.

spatial mode approximation, we characterize our model system as two coupled
spins. For certain initial states, we find full magnetization oscillations
between wells not accompanied by mass (or atom numbers) exchange. We identify
dynamic regimes of collective spin variables arising from nonlinear
self-interactions that are different from the usual Josephson oscillations. We
also discuss magnetization beats and incomplete oscillations of collective spin
variables other than the magnetization. Our study points to an alternative
approach to observe coherent tunnelling of a condensate through a (spatial)

The use of a far-blue detuned lattice and a magnetically insensitive
computational basis makes the scheme robust against decoherence. The present
scheme is a promising candidate for experimental implementation of quantum
computation and for graph state preparation in one, two or three spatial
