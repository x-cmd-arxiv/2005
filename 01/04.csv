together with ISO SWS and optical and UV line intensities from the literature,
considering two independent emission components: the AGN component and the
starburst component in the circumnuclear ring of 3 kpc in size. Using the UV to
mid-IR emission line spectrum to constrain the nuclear ionizing continuum, we
have confirmed previous results: a canonical power-law ionizing spectrum is a
poorer fit than one with a deep absorption trough, while the presence of a big
blue bump is ruled out. Based on starburst synthesis models, we were able to
fit the mid- and far-infrared fine-structure line emission, with a low
ionization parameter (logU=-3.5) and low densities (n=100 cm^-3). Combining AGN
and starburst components, we succeeded in modeling the overall UV to far-IR
atomic spectrum of NGC1068, reproducing the line fluxes to within a factor 2.0
on average with a standard deviation of 1.3 and the overall continuum as the
sum of the contribution of the thermal dust emission in the ionized and neutral
components. TheOH 119 um emission indicates that the line is collisionally
excited and arises in a warm and dense region. The OH emission has been modeled
using spherically symmetric, non-local, non-LTE radiative transfer models. The
models indicate that the bulk of the emission arises from the nuclear region,
although some extended contribution from the starburst is not ruled out. The OH
abundance in the nuclear region is expected to be $\sim10^{-5}$, characteristic

observation of an X-shaped radio galaxy, and one of the goals of this
pioneering study is to determine the relationship between the X-ray emitting
gas and the X-shaped radio morphology. The X-ray isophotes of the hot gas
within $\sim3.5''$ of the central galaxy are highly elliptical
(eccentricity$\sim$0.57) and co-aligned with the elliptical optical isophotes.
This supports the hypothesis that X-shaped radio sources are created by
propagation of jets through asymmetric density distributions. Within large
uncertainties, there is no evidence that the lobes or wings are overpressurized
relative to the ISM. We have detected X-ray emission from several of the radio
knots to the E of the active nucleus, and diffuse emission from the radio lobe
to the W. The X-ray emission from the eastern knots cannot be explained by an
inverse Compton model unless they are far from equipartition. Using archival
HST data, optical emission is detected from two knots, and the
radio/optical/X-ray spectra are well fitted by simple synchrotron models. This
is one of the strongest examples to date of X-ray synchrotron emission from
multiple knots in the jet of an FR II radio galaxy. X-ray emission is also
detected from the radio wings at a flux consistent with inverse Compton
scattering of CMB photons from relativistic electrons if the wings are near
equipartition. The nuclear spectrum is well described by a multi-component
model that includes a heavily absorbed power law and a bright, broadened Fe
line. A second, less absorbed, power-law component, likely to represent
unresolved emission from a pc-scale jet, is also required.

supercluster field galaxies, we conclude that the frequency of emission-line
galaxies (ELGs; W_lambda >/= 20 angstroms) is similar for field and cluster
early-type galaxies. A similar result has previously been obtained for galaxies
of types Sa and later. Together, these results confirm the inference of Biviano
et al. that the relative frequency of ELGs in clusters and the field can be
entirely accounted for by the different mix of morphological types between the
differing environments. Detected emission is classified as `compact' or
`diffuse', identified as circumnuclear starburst or AGN emission and disk
emission respectively. By comparing spectroscopic data for cluster early-type
ELGs with data for field galaxies from the Palomar Spectroscopic Survey of
nearby galactic nuclei, we demonstrate there is modest evidence for an
enhancement of compact HII emission relative to AGN emission in the early-type
cluster ELGs as compared to the field. For the cluster early-type galaxies,
compact HII emission correlates strongly with a disturbed morphology. This
suggests that, as for later type cluster galaxies, this enhanced compact HII
emission can readily be explained as an enhancement of circumnuclear starburst
emission due to gravitational tidal interactions, most likely caused by
sub-cluster merging and other on-going processes of cluster virialisation.

that the dust belts which have been detected to date should have eta0>>1; dust
belts with eta0<<1 are hard to detect as they are much fainter than the stellar
photosphere. This is confirmed for a sample of 37 debris disk candidates for
which eta0 was determined to be >10. This means that these disks are so massive
that mutual collisions prevent dust from reaching the inner regions of these
systems and P-R drag can be ignored when studying their dynamics. Models for
the formation of structure in debris disks by the trapping of particles into
planetary resonances by P-R drag should be reconsidered. However, since
collisions do not halt 100% of the dust, this means that in the absence of
planetary companions debris disk systems should be populated by small
quantities of hot dust which may be detectable in the mid-IR. Even in disks
with eta0<<1 the temperature of dust emission is shown to be a reliable tracer
of the planetesimal distribution meaning that inner holes in the dust
distribution imply a lack of colliding planetesimals in the inner regions.

distributions of charge to see why clumps of charge do not produce large

distribution of the electric potential and field in a totally disordered system
that is overall electroneutral. An infinite system of point charges is called
totally disordered if the locations of the points and the values of the charges
are random. It is called electroneutral if the mean charge is zero. In one
dimension, we show that the electric field is always small, of the order of the
field of a single charge, and the spatial variations in potential are what can
be produced by a single charge. In two and three dimensions, the electric field
in similarly disordered electroneutral systems is usually small, with small
variations. Interestingly, in two and three dimensional systems, the electric
potential is usually very large, even though the electric field is not: large
amounts of energy are needed to put together a typical disordered configuration
of charges in two and three dimensions, but not in one dimension. If the system
is locally electroneutral--as well as globally electroneutral--the potential is
usually small in all dimensions. The properties considered here arise from the
superposition of electric fields of quasi-static distributions of charge, as in
nonmetallic solids or ionic solutions. These properties are found in
distributions of charge far from equilibrium.

general expressions for the partial decay widths of all members of the
antidecuplet as functions of the two mixing angles. Identifying N_{anti-10}
with the N(1670) observed by the GRAAL experiment, we show that the considered
mixing scenario can accommodate all present experimental and phenomenological
information on the \Theta^+ and N_{anti-10} decays: \Theta^+ could be as narrow
as 1 MeV; the N_{anti-10} -> N + \eta decay is sizable, while the N_{anti-10}
->N + \pi decay is suppressed and the N_{anti-10} ->\Lambda + K decay is
possibly suppressed. Constraining the mixing angles by the N_{anti-10} decays,
we make definite predictions for the \Sigma_{anti-10} decays. We point out that
\Sigma_{anti-10} with mass near 1770 MeV could be searched for in the available
data on K_S p invariant mass spectrum, which already revealed the \Theta^+
peak. It is important to experimentally verify the decay properties of
\Sigma(1770) because its mass and J^P=1/2^+ make it an attractive candidate for
\Sigma_{anti-10}.

well-known Wilson loops, while in general they may carry 't Hooft magnetic

moving in spherical shell model mean field and interacting among themselves

treated within a fully renormalized (FR) pnQRPA approach. Two decoupling
schemes are formulated. One of them decouples the equations of motion of
particle total number conserving and non-conserving operators. One ends up with
two very simple dispersion equations for phonon operators which are formally of
Tamm-Dancoff types. For excitations in the (N-1,Z+1) system, Ikeda sum rule is
fully satisfied provided the BCS equations are renormalized as well and
therefore solved at a time with the FRpnQRPA equations. Next, one constructs
two operators ${\cal R}^{\dagger}_{1\mu}$, ${\cal R}_{1,-\mu}(-)^{1-\mu}$ which
commutes with the particle total number conserving operators, ${\cal
A}^{\dagger}_{1\mu}$ and ${\cal A}_{1,-\mu}(-)^{1-\mu}$, and moreover could be
renormalized so that they become bosons. Then, a phonon operator is built up as
a linear combination of these four operators. The FRpnQRPA equations are
written down for this complex phonon operator and the ISR is calculated
analytically. This formalism allows for an unified description of the dipole
excitations in four neighboring nuclei (N-1,Z+1),(N+1,Z-1),(N-1,Z-1),(N+1,Z+1).
The phonon vacuum describes the (N,Z) system ground state.

compare those with hadronic predictions and data. In spite of substantial
differences in the participating SF, the two representations produce

eucaryotic organisms contain significantly more self-interacting proteins than
expected if such homodimers randomly appeared in the course of the evolution.
We also show that on average homodimers have twice as many interaction partners
than non-self-interacting proteins. More specifically the likelihood of a
protein to physically interact with itself was found to be proportional to the
total number of its binding partners. These properties of dimers are are in
agreement with a phenomenological model in which individual proteins differ
from each other by the degree of their ``stickiness'' or general propensity
towards interaction with other proteins including oneself. A duplication of
self-interacting proteins creates a pair of paralogous proteins interacting
with each other. We show that such pairs occur more frequently than could be
explained by pure chance alone. Similar to homodimers, proteins involved in
heterodimers with their paralogs on average have twice as many interacting
partners than the rest of the network. The likelihood of a pair of paralogous
proteins to interact with each other was also shown to decrease with their
sequence similarity. This all points to the conclusion that most of
interactions between paralogs are inherited from ancestral homodimeric
proteins, rather than established de novo after the duplication. We finally
discuss possible implications of our empirical observations from functional and

three types of 1D structures, namely, secondary structure, contact number and
residue-wise contact order which is introduced here for the first time. Using
simulated annealing molecular dynamics simulations, the structures satisfying
the given native 1D structural restraints were sought for 16 proteins of
various structural classes and of sizes ranging from 56 to 146 residues. By
selecting the structures best satisfying the restraints, all the proteins
showed a coordinate RMS deviation of less than 4\AA{} from the native
structure, and for most of them, the deviation was even less than 2\AA{}. The
present result opens a new possibility to protein structure prediction and our
understanding of the sequence-structure relationship.

successfully applied to problems of computational Molecular Biology. In a
predictive task, the HMM is endowed with a decoding algorithm in order to
assign the most probable state path, and in turn the class labeling, to an
unknown sequence. The Viterbi and the posterior decoding algorithms are the
most common. The former is very efficient when one path dominates, while the
latter, even though does not guarantee to preserve the automaton grammar, is
more effective when several concurring paths have similar probabilities. A
third good alternative is 1-best, which was shown to perform equal or better
than Viterbi. Results: In this paper we introduce the posterior-Viterbi (PV) a
new decoding which combines the posterior and Viterbi algorithms. PV is a two
step process: first the posterior probability of each state is computed and
then the best posterior allowed path through the model is evaluated by a
Viterbi algorithm.
  Conclusions: We show that PV decoding performs better than other algorithms
first on toy models and then on the computational biological problem of the
prediction of the topology of beta-barrel membrane proteins.

processing. Several proposals for quantum information transfer along linear
arrays of nearest-neighbor coupled qubits or spins were made recently. Perfect
transfer was shown to exist in two models with specifically designed strongly
inhomogeneous couplings. We show that perfect transfer occurs in an entire
class of chains, including systems whose nearest-neighbor couplings vary only
weakly along the chain. The key to these observations is the Jordan-Wigner
mapping of spins to noninteracting lattice fermions which display perfectly
periodic dynamics if the single-particle energy spectrum is appropriate. After
a half-period of that dynamics any state is transformed into its mirror image
with respect to the center of the chain. The absence of fermion interactions
preserves these features at arbitrary temperature and allows for the transfer
of nontrivially entangled states of several spins or qubits.

Detection of one photon from our entangled pairs constitutes a triggered single

stations found coincidence counts in the detection events by calculating the
cross-correlation of locally-recorded time stamps shared over a public internet
channel. For this experiment, our quantum channel was maintained for a total of
40 minutes during which time a coincidence lock found approximately 60000
coincident detection events. The polarization correlations in those events
yielded a Bell parameter, S=2.27/pm0.019, which violates the CHSH-Bell
inequality by 14 standard deviations. This result is promising for
entanglement-based free-space quantum communication in high-density urban
areas. It is also encouraging for optical quantum communication between ground
stations and satellites since the length of our free-space link exceeds the

develop the theory of stochastic electrodynamics (SED) with a view to
establishing it as the foundation for quantum mechanics. The theory had several
important successes, but failed when applied to the study of particles subject
to nonlinear forces. An analysis of the failure showed that its reasons are not
to be ascribed to the principles of SED, but to the methods used to construct
the theory, particularly the use of a Fokker-Planck approximation and
perturbation theory. A new, non perturbative approach has been developed,
called linear stochastic electrodynamics (LSED), of which a clean form is
presented here. After introducing the fundamentals of SED, we discuss in detail
the principles on which LSED is constructed. We pay attention to the
fundamental issue of the mechanism that leads to the quantum behaviour of field
and matter, and demonstrate that indeed LSED is a natural way to the quantum
formalism by demanding its solutions to comply with a limited number of
principles, each one with a clear physical meaning. As a further application of
the principles of LSED we derive also the Planck distribution. In a final
section we revisit some of the most tantalizing quandaries of quantum mechanics
from the point of view offered by the present theory, and show that it offers a
clear physical answer to them.

lifetime $\geq5.6\times$, limited only by our temporal resolution. Analysis of
the spectral dependence of the recombination dynamics shows a maximum lifetime
shortening of $19\pm4$. From the directly measured enhancement and suppression
we show that the single mode coupling efficiency for quantum dots in such

$\sim97%$.
