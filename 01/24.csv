more parameters to fit the data. We compute the Bayesian evidence for fits to a

an average distance of d \approx 90 pc, spatially at the near boundary of the
Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC) subgroup of the Ophiuchus-Scorpius-Centaurus OB-star

we conclude that these stars form a spatially- and rotationally-distinct

formula to estimate blend losses, which can be converted to apparent magnitude
biases using the luminosity function of the analyzed sample. Because of the
used assumptions, our results give lower limits of the total bias and we show
that in some cases even these limits point toward significant limitations in
measuring apparent brightnesses of ``standard candle'' stars, thus distances to
nearby galaxies. A special application is presented for the OGLE-II BVI maps of
the Large Magellanic Cloud. We find a previously neglected systematic bias up
to 0.2-0.3 mag for faint stars (V~18.0-19.0) in the OGLE-II sample, which
affects LMC distance measurements using RR Lyrae and red clump stars. We also
consider the effects of intrinsic stellar correlations, i.e. binarity, via
calculating two-point correlation functions for stellar fields around seven
recently exploded classical novae. In two cases, for V1494 Aql and V705 Cas,
the reported close optical companions seem to be physically correlated with the
cataclysmic systems. Finally, we find significant blend frequencies up to
50-60% in the samples of wide-field exoplanetary surveys, which suggests that
blending calculations are highly advisable to be included into the regular

sequence (MS), with a minority population of bluer and fainter MS well
separated from a majority population of MS stars. Here we confirm, with the
most up-to-date Y2 isochrones, that this special feature can only be reproduced
by assuming a large variation (Delta Y = 0.15) of primordial helium abundance
among several distinct populations in this cluster. We further show that the
same helium enhancement required for this special feature on the MS can by
itself reproduce the extreme horizontal-branch (HB) stars observed in Omega
Cen, which are hotter than normal HB stars. Similarly, the complex features on
the HBs of other globular clusters, such as NGC 2808, are explained by large
internal variations of helium abundance. Supporting evidence for the
helium-rich population is also provided by the far-UV (FUV) observations of
extreme HB stars in these clusters, where the enhancement of helium can
naturally explain the observed fainter FUV luminosity for these stars. The
presence of super helium-rich populations in some globular clusters suggests
that the third parameter, other than metallicity and age, also influences CMD
morphology of these clusters.

narrow-angled-tailed (NAT) radio galaxy, reveals a small cool X-ray thermal
corona (~ 0.6 keV) embedded in the hot ICM of the Perseus cluster (~ 6.7 keV).
The corona is asymmetric with a sharp edge (~ 2.2'', or 0.8 kpc from the
nucleus) to the south and an extension to the north (at least ~ 8'' from the
nucleus), which is interpreted as the action of ram pressure while solely the
static ICM confinement is unable to explain. We estimate that the corona is
moving with a velocity of ~ 2.4 - 4.2 times the local sound speed to the south.
The presence of the sharp edge for this small corona indicates that the
transport processes are largely suppressed by the magnetic field there. The
magnetic field around the corona also suppresses heat conduction by at least a
factor of ~ 60 across the corona boundary. We conclude that it is unrealistic
to study the interaction of the small X-ray coronae with the hot ICM without
the consideration of the roles that magnetic field plays, a factor not included
in current simulations. An absorbed (N_H=1.5-3x10^22 cm^-2) nucleus is also
detected, which is not usual for FR I radio galaxies. Weak X-ray emission from
three inner radio knots in the jets is also detected. Indentations at the east
and west of the corona indicate interaction between the jets and the X-ray
corona. Narrow jets carry great amounts of energy out of the central AGN and
release the energy outside the corona, preserving the tiny and vulnerable
corona. This case reveals that the inner kpc core of the corona of massive
galaxies can survive both high-speed stripping and powerful AGN feedback. Thus,
the cooling of the X-ray coronae potentially provides fuel to the central SMBH
in rich environments where the amount of the galactic cold gas is at a minimum.

transport of gas energy and heavy elements, and particle acceleration. The {\it

broadened lines due to turbulent motion. In order to explore the
above-mentioned issues, it is important to investigate the generation processes
and structure of ICM turbulence. We investigate the ICM dynamical evolution in
and around a moving substructure with three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations. Eddy-like structures develop near the boundary between the
substructure and the ambient ICM through Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.
Because of these structures, characteristic patterns appear in the
line-of-sight velocity distribution of the ICM.

kinematics of fifteen intermediate to late type edge-on spiral galaxies using a
dynamical modeling technique. From the photometry we find that intrinsically
more flattened discs tend to have a lower face-on central surface brightness
and a larger dynamica mass-to-light ratio. This observation suggests that at a
constant maximum rotational velocity lower surface brightness discs have
smaller vertical stellar velocity dispersions.Although the individual
uncertainties are large, we find from the dynamical modeling that at least
twelve discs are submaximal. The average disc contributes 53$\pm$4 percent to
the observed rotation at 2.2 disc scalelengths, with a 1$\sigma$ scatter of 15
percent. This percentage becomes somewhat lower when effects of finite disc
flattening and gravity by the dark halo and the gas are taken into account.
Since boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are probably associated with bars, the
result suggests that at 2.2$h_{\rm R}$ the submaximal nature of discs is
independent of barredness. The possibility remains that very high surface
brightness discs are maximal.We confirm that the radial stellar disc velocity
dispersion is related to the galaxy maximum rotational velocity. The scatter in
this $\sigma-v_{\rm max}$ relation appears to correlate with the disc
flattening, face-on central surface brightness and dynamical mass-to-light
ratio. Low surface brightness discs tend to be more flattened and have smaller
stellar velocity dispersions. The findings are consistent with the observed
correlation between disc flattening and dynamical mass-to-light ratio.

negligible. As expected, ML was found to produce maps with lower residual noise
than destriping. In addition to residual noise, the maps also contain an error
which is due to the effect of subpixel structure in the signal on the

large sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the rich cluster MS1008-1224 at
z=0.306. The PHP relation has an intrinsic dispersion of ~32% in re, and turns
out to be independent of waveband. This result is consistent with the fact that
internal colour gradients of ETGs can have only a mild dependence on galaxy
luminosity (mass). There is no evidence for a significant curvature in the PHP.
We show that this can be explained if this relation origins from a systematic
variation of the specific entropy of ETGs along the galaxy sequence, as was
suggested from previous works. The intrinsic scatter of the PHP is
significantly smaller than for other purely photometric relations, such as the
Kormendy relation and the photometric Fundamental Plane, which is constructed
by using colours in place of velocity dispersions. The scatter does not depend
on the waveband and the residuals about the plane do not correlate with
residuals of the colour-magnitude relation. Finally, we compare the
coefficients of the PHP at z~0.3 with those of ETGs at z~0, showing that the
PHP is a valuable tool to constrain the luminosity evolution of ETGs with
redshift. The slopes of the PHP do not change significantly with redshift,
while the zero-point is consistent with cosmological dimming of the surface
brightness in an expanding universe plus the passive fading of galaxy stellar
populations with a high formation redshift (z_f >1-2).

particular attention on the different role played by the different notions of
distances (filled beam angular diameter distance and Dyer-Roder distances) when
calculating this quantity, following the prescription from Ehlers & Schneider
for a coherent formalism. We find that the expected number of gravitationally
lensed quasars is a decreasing function of the clumpiness parameter.

ensemble of stable g-modes. We show that the static multimode solution does not
exist. We then find the condition for the stability of the statistical
equilibrium.
  Performing numerical integration of amplitude equations for a simplified
system we find that the acoustic mode amplitude exhibits a large irregular
variability on the timescale given by the inverse of the growth rate.
  The g-mode pairs are excited in significantly wider range of detuning
parameters than it is implied by the parametric instability criterion applied
to the average amplitude. However, the number of interacting g-mode pairs is
reduced because the pairs differing in the detuning parameter by less than
their damping rates are synchronized and effectively act as a single pair.
  We apply the multimode resonant coupling theory to a realistic stellar model.
We choose a seismic model of the Delta Scuti star XX Pyxidis. Although for some
l=2 modes we find amplitudes of the order of a few milimagnitudes, the typical
amplitudes of low-degree modes are much higher. Taking into account the
rotational splitting results in decrease of amplitudes by a factor of few which
is not enough to obtain consistency with observations. We conclude that in this
star and likely in all evolved Delta Scuti stars, the resonant mode coupling
cannot be the dominant amplitude limiting effect. The nonresonant saturation of
the driving effect must play the role.

in morphology between most fields, indicating that the age and/or metallicity
mix of stars is not constant at large radius. This directly confirms the
existence of large-scale population inhomogeneities within the halo of M31 and
lends further support to the notion that M31 has formed, at least in part,

populations of the giant stellar stream and those of another overdensity, the
NE shelf, which lies north-east of the galaxy center. If these overdensities

investigate the pairing symmetry and the transition temperature in the

the Eliashberg equation using the third order perturbation theory with respect
to the on-site repulsion $U$. As results of the 2D calculation, we obtain
distinct two types of stable spin-triplet pairing states. One is the
$f$-wave(B$_1$) pairing around $n = 1.2$ and in a small $U$ region, which is
caused by the ferromagnetic fluctuation. Then, the other is the $p_x$(or
$p_y$)-wave(E$_1$) pairing in large $U$ region far from the half-filling ($n =
1$) which is caused by the vertex corrections only. However, we find that the
former $f$-wave pairing is destroyed by introduced 3D dispersion. This is
because the 3D dispersion breaks the favorable structures for the $f$-wave
pairing such as the van Hove singularities and the small pocket structures.
Thus, we conclude that the ferromagnetic fluctuation mediated spin-triplet
state can not explain the superconductivity of UPt$_3$. We also study the case
of the pairing symmetry with a polar gap. This $p_z$-wave(A$_1$) is stabilized
by the large hopping integral along c-axis $t_z$. It is nearly degenerate with
the suppressed $p_x$(or $p_y$)-wave(E$_1$) in the best fitting parameter region
to UPt$_3$ ($1.3 \le t_z \le 1.5$). These two p-wave pairing states exist in
the region far from the half-filling, in which the vertex correction terms play
crucial roles like the case in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

inside the silo are imaged and tracked with unprecedented resolution in both

obtained by varying the orifice width and the hopper angle allows us to
thoroughly test models of gravity driven flows inside these geometries. All of
our measured velocity profiles are smooth and free of the shock-like
discontinuities (""rupture zones"") predicted by critical state soil mechanics.
On the other hand, we find that the simple Kinematic Model accurately captures
the mean velocity profile near the orifice, although it fails to describe the
rapid transition to plug flow far away from the orifice. The measured diffusion
length $b$, the only free parameter in the model, is not constant as usually
assumed, but increases with both the height above the orifice and the angle of
the hopper. We discuss improvements to the model to account for the
differences. From our data, we also directly measure the diffusion of the
particles and find it to be significantly less than predicted by the Void
Model, which provides the classical microscopic derivation of the Kinematic
Model in terms of diffusing voids in the packing. However, the experimental
data is consistent with the recently proposed Spot Model, based on a simple
mechanism for cooperative diffusion. Finally, we discuss the flow rate as a
function of the orifice width and hopper angles. We find that the flow rate
scales with the orifice size to the power of 1.5, consistent with dimensional
analysis. Interestingly, the flow rate increases when the funnel angle is
increased.

channel is considered where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the
fading coefficients. The spectral-efficiency/bit-energy tradeoff in the
low-power regime is examined when the input has limited peakedness. It is shown
that if a fourth moment input constraint is imposed or the input
peak-to-average power ratio is limited, then in contrast to the behavior
observed in average power limited channels, the minimum bit energy is not
always achieved at zero spectral efficiency. The low-power performance is also
characterized when there is a fixed peak limit that does not vary with the
average power. A new signaling scheme that overlays phase-shift keying on
on-off keying is proposed and shown to be optimally efficient in the low-power
regime.

is basically the same as at $\eta=0$. The Cronin effect is described as a
result of the final-state instead of the initial-state interaction. The
suppression of $R_{CP}$ at high $\eta$ is due to the reduction of the soft
parton density on the deuteron side, thus resulting in less pions produced by
recombination, an explanation that requires no new physics. In $Au+Au$
collisions large $p/\pi$ ratio is obtained because the thermal partons can
contribute to the formation of proton more than they do to the pion.

density-dependent meson-nucleon coupling vertices is modified by introducing
couplings of the meson fields to derivative nucleon densities. As a
consequence, the nucleon self energies, that describe the effective in-medium
interaction, become momentum dependent. In this approach it is possible to
increase the effective (Landau) mass of the nucleons, that is related to the
density of states at the Fermi energy, as compared to conventional relativistic
models. At the same time the relativistic effective (Dirac) mass is kept small
in order to obtain a realistic strength of the spin-orbit interaction.
Additionally, the empirical Schroedinger-equivalent central optical potential
from Dirac phenomenology is reasonably well described. A parametrization of the

inferred from the orthographic projection. An analytic equivalent of this
geometry can be derived by the application of Potential Field Methods in the
case of Atlantic type oceans. Laplace equation must be obeyed by the velocity
field between the ridge and the passive margin if we neglect the very slight
compressibility of ocean lithosphere. A strain wave propagates in the sphere
analogous to the behaviour of a free harmonic oscillator. Combining zonal
harmonics of order one and sectorial harmonics of degree one we obtain a
tesseral harmonic equivalent to the orthographic solution. This potential field
approach is valid for homogeneous deformation regime in oceanic lithosphere.
Above a compression threshold of 5 to 10% buckling and simultaneous faulting
occurs. In Pacific type oceans a dynamic approach, similar to a forced
oscillation, must be applied because there are sinks in subduction zones.

C19th PG measurements in both polluted and clean Parisian air present a unique

  (ISBN 2-7257-0008-6), 1, 357-360",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  Detailed tropospheric ion measurements are needed to improve understanding of
the electrical microphysics affecting clouds. Additionally, atmospheric ion
mobility spectra can be used to identify ion growth processes leading to
condensation nucleus formation. However these measurements are rare,
particularly in the troposphere where the majority of clouds form. Developments
in the operating theory of the classical instrument for ion measurement, the
aspirated cylindrical capacitor, are described, which enable ion mobility
spectrum information to be extracted from the rate of voltage decay of the
aspirated capacitor in air. In this paper, data from historical balloon-borne
ion counter ascents will be reanalysed to extract new ion mobility spectra from
simple voltage time series. Such data recovery will increase the amount of
atmospheric ion spectra available for analysis.

atom (molecule) interacting with a plane surface of an uniaxial crystal or with
a long solid cylinder or cylindrical shell made of isotropic material or
uniaxial crystal. For a microparticle near a semispace or flat plate made of an
uniaxial crystal the exact expressions for the free energy of the van der Waals
and Casimir-Polder interaction are presented. An approximate expression for the
free energy of microparticle- cylinder interaction is obtained which becomes
precise for microparticle-cylinder separations much smaller than cylinder
radius. The obtained expressions are used to investigate the van der Waals
interaction between hydrogen atoms (molecules) and graphite plates or multiwall
carbon nanotubes. To accomplish this the behavior of graphite dielectric
permittivities along the imaginary frequency axis is found using the optical
data for the complex refractive index of graphite for the ordinary and
extraordinary rays. It is shown that the position of hydrogen atoms inside
multiwall carbon nanotubes is energetically preferable compared with outside.

  Mechanics","16 pages, submitted to Foundations of Physics Letters",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we introduce the three main notions of probability used by
physicists and discuss how these are to be used when invoking spacelike
separated observers in a relativistic format. We discuss a standard EPRB
experiment and concentrate upon problems of the interpretation of
probabilities. We promote a particularly conservative interpretation of this
experiment (which need not invoke an objective notion of collapse) where
probabilities are, tentatively, passively Lorentz invariant. We also argue that
the Heisenberg picture is preferable in relativistic situations due to a
conflict between the Schrodinger picture and passive Lorentz transformations of
probabilities. Throughout most of this paper we discuss the relative frequency
interpretation of probability as this is most commonly used. We also introduce
the logically necessary notion of `prior-frequency' in discussing whether the
choice by an observer can have any causal effect upon the measurement results
of another. We also critically examine the foundational use of relative
frequency in no-signalling theorems. We argue that SQT and SR are
probabilistically compatible, although we do not discuss whether they are
compatible on the level of individual events.

two spin-$\frac 12$ quantum systems is decreased during teleportation via the
thermal mixed state in 1D Heisenberg chain. The entanglement teleportation will
be realized if the minimal entanglement of the thermal mixed state is provided
in such quantum channel. High average fidelity of teleportation with values
larger than 2/3 is obtained when the temperature {\it T} is very low. The
mutual information $\mathcal{I}$ of the quantum channel declines with the
increase of the temperature and the external magnetic field. The entanglement
quality of input signal states cannot enhance mutual information of the quantum
