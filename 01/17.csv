such as D/O, D/N and the H2 fraction. Our efforts are concentrated on measuring
gas-phase D/H, which is key to understanding Galactic chemical evolution and
comparing it to predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We find column
densities log N(HI) = 20.41+-0.08, log N(DI)=15.75+-0.08 and log N(H2) =
19.33+-0.04, yielding a molecular hydrogen fraction of 0.14+-0.02 (2 sigma
errors), with an excitation temperature of 143+-5K. The high HI column density
implies that PG0038+199 lies outside of the Local Bubble; we estimate its
distance to be 297 (+164,-104)pc (1 sigma). D/[HI+2H2] toward PG0038+199 is
1.91(+0.52,-0.42) e-5 (2 sigma). There is no evidence of component structure on
the scale of Delta v > 8 km/s based on NaI, but there is marginal evidence for
structure on smaller scales. The D/H value is high compared to the majority of
recent D/H measurements, but consistent with the values for two other
measurements at similar distances. D/O is in agreement with other distant
measurements. The scatter in D/H values beyond ~100pc remains a challenge for
Galactic chemical evolution.

distortions due to its off-axis location in the HST focal plane; correcting for
these distortions by resampling the pixel values onto an undistorted frame
results in pixel correlations that depend on the nature of the interpolation
kernel used for the resampling. This poses a major challenge for the SBF
technique, which normally assumes a flat power spectrum for the noise. We
investigate a number of different interpolation kernels and show through an
analysis of simulated galaxy images having realistic noise properties that it
is possible, depending on the kernel, to measure SBF distances using
distortion-corrected ACS images without introducing significant additional
error from the resampling. We conclude by showing examples of real image power
spectra from our survey.

peak of spectrum is now located at a frequency $\nu_E \simeq
(\frac{\Omega_m}{\Omega_{\Lambda}})^{1/3} \nu_H$, where $\nu_H$ is the Hubble
frequency, and there appears a new segment of spectrum between $\nu_E$ and

amplitude acquires an extra factor $\frac{\Omega_m}{\Omega_{\Lambda}}$, due to
the current acceleration, otherwise the shape of spectrum is similar to that in
the decelerating models. The recent WMAP result of CMB anisotropies is used to
normalize the amplitude for gravitational waves. The slope of the power
spectrum depends sensitively on the scale factor $a(\tau) \propto
|\tau|^{1+\beta}$ during the inflationary stage with $\beta=-2$ for the exact
de Sitter space. With the increasing of $\beta$, the resulting spectrum is
tilted to be flatter with more power on high frequencies, and the sensitivity
of the second science run of the LIGO detectors puts a restriction on the
parameter $\beta \leq -1.8$. We also give a numerical solution which confirms

to correlate with physical properties of their hosts, including the mass of the
dark-matter halos. At higher redshifts, we observe the growth of SMBHs
indirectly through identification of high redshift quasars. However information
on their hosts is difficult to obtain. In this paper we determine the masses of
halos that host high redshift quasars (at z>4) by comparing the rate of growth
of quasar density with that predicted by the Press-Schechter mass function. The
host mass determined depends on how the ratio between SMBH and host halo mass
evolves with redshift. Assuming the ratio between SMBH and halo mass does not
evolve with redshift, we find a host halo mass of log(M)=11.7+/-0.3 solar
masses. Even if the quasars shine at their Eddington limit, this mass is
significantly smaller than that seen in the local universe. Indeed the
null-hypothesis, of a constant SMBH to halo mass ratio at all redshifts, can be
ruled out at greater than a 5-sigma level. SMBHs must therefore have
contributed a larger fraction to the host mass in the past. Including redshift
evolution of the SMBH to halo mass ratio, we find larger halo masses of
log(M)=12.4+/-0.3 solar masses, and a ratio between SMBH and halo mass that
increases with redshift as ~(1+z)^1.5 are required to be consistent with both
local and high redshift observations. We investigate restrictions placed on the
critical linear overdensity of quasar hosts at their epoch of virialisation and
find that it cannot exceed the traditional value of delta_c=1.69 by more than a
factor of two. Finally, we find that the high redshift quasars are hosted by
fluctuations on scales that have a variance of (delta M/M) = 2-3, corresponding
to (3-4.5)-sigma fluctuations in the density field.

there were two successive outbursts in A.D. 1073 and in A.D. 1074, separated by

the context of brane world scenarios. Such models allow more time for structure
formation to take place at high redshifts, easing, e.g., the tension between
the observed and predicted evolution of the quasar population with redshift.
While having the desirable effect of boosting the growth of structures, we show
that in such models the position of the first peak in the power spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background anisotropies severely constrains the amount of

are quantified through the rate of reduction of the distance between the voids,
through the correlated directional growth of the voids, and through correlated
shape evolution of the voids. The critical inter-void ligament distance marking
the onset of coalescence is shown to be approximately one void radius based on
the quantification measurements used, independent of the initial separation
distance between the voids and the strain-rate of the expansion of the system.
The interaction of the voids is not reflected in the volumetric asymptotic
growth rate of the voids, as demonstrated here. Finally, the practice of using

frictionless droplets interacting via nonlinear normal forces obtained using
experimental data acquired by confocal microscopy of compressed emulsions
systems. Granular materials are modeled by Hertz-Mindlin deformable spherical
grains with Coulomb friction. In both cases, we find power-law scaling for the
vanishing of pressure and excess number of contacts as the system approaches
the jamming transition from high volume fractions. We find that the
construction history parametrized by the compression rate during the

granular materials but not on emulsions. This leads the granular system to jam
at different volume fractions depending on the histories. Isostaticity is found
in the packings close to the jamming transition in emulsions and in granular
materials at slow compression rates and infinite friction. Heterogeneity of
interparticle forces increases as the packings approach the jamming transition

small values of the participation number measuring spatial localization of the

separation can be thermodynamically stable only in the presence of repulsive
Coulomb interactions. Phase separation enables the appearance of
superconductivity in a heterophase sample even if it were impossible in
pure-phase matter. Phase separation is crucial for the occurrence of
superconductivity in bad conductors. Critical temperature for a mixture of
pairing symmetries is higher than the critical temperature related to any pure
gap-wave symmetry of this mixture. In bad conductors, the critical temperature
as a function of the superconductivity fraction has a bell shape. Phase
separation makes the single-particle energy dispersion softer. For planar
structures phase separation suppresses d-wave superconductivity and enhances
s-wave superconductivity. These features are in agreement with experiments for
cuprates.

research strongly suggests that unstable attractors exist and even occur
robustly (i.e. for open sets of parameter values) in a system modelling
biological phenomena, namely in globally coupled oscillators with delayed pulse
interactions.
  In the first part of this paper we give a rigorous definition of unstable
attractors for general dynamical systems. We classify unstable attractors into
two types, depending on whether or not there is a neighbourhood of the
attractor that intersects the basin in a set of positive measure. We give
examples of both types of unstable attractor; these examples have
non-invertible dynamics that collapse certain open sets onto stable manifolds
of saddle orbits.

robust occurrence of unstable attractors in a network of oscillators with
delayed pulse coupling. Although such systems are technically hybrid systems of
delay differential equations with discontinuous `firing' events, we show that
their dynamics reduces to a finite dimensional hybrid system system after a
finite time and hence we can discuss Milnor attractors for this reduced finite
dimensional system. We prove that for an open set of phase resetting functions
there are saddle periodic orbits that are unstable attractors.

mixings. One interesting feature of these scenarios is that the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) is unstable, with several of its decay properties
predicted in terms of neutrino mixing angles. A smoking gun of this model in
colliders is the presence of displaced vertices due to LSP decays in large
parts of the parameter space. In this work we focus on the simplest model of
this type that comes from minimal supergravity with universal R-parity
conserving soft breaking of supersymmetry (RmSUGRA). We evaluate the
potentiality of the Fermilab Tevatron to probe the RmSUGRA parameters through
the analysis of events possessing two displaced vertices stemming from LSP
decays. We show that requiring two displaced vertices in the events leads to a
reach in m_{1/2} twice the one in the usual multilepton signals in a large

new point of view. The presently accepted expansion of the Universe is
interpreted here as an apparent effect, as seen from the Lab system of
reference. The static Universe has immersed in it a local shrinking atomic
world: a fundamental change in the interpretation of the Hubble's observations.
The conservation principles (momentum, angular momentum and energy) can be
dealt with under 2 different points of view: local (apparent) and COSMOLOGICAL
(""real""). The 2 are in complete agreement with observation. They are also free
of well known contradictions or paradoxes/incoherencies (i.e. in the Big Bang
model). By dealing now with very well known first principles (Heisenberg, Mach,
de Broglie, Weinberg's relation) under the same 2 points of view, we arrive at
the conclusion that our new approach is in accordance with the Einstein's field
equations of General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. We consider this to be
a promising first step towards the way of dealing with the gravitational field
coherently both from the General Relativity and from the Quantum Mechanical
theories. The agreement with the present values of the cosmological parameters
is very satisfactory.
