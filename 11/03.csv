clouds, we estimate the reliability to be 82%. Low contrast clouds should have
lower reliabilities. Verification of the reality of individual clouds will
require additional data. We identify 10,931 candidate infrared dark clouds. For
each IRDC, we also catalog cores. These cores, defined as localized regions
with at least 40% higher extinction than the cloud's average extinction, are
found by iteratively fitting 2-dimensional elliptical Gaussians to the contrast
peaks. We identify 12,774 cores. The catalog contains the position, angular

density profile in and near the gap. The simplest approach, which is based upon
the balance between the torques due to the viscosity and the gravity of the
planet and assumes local damping, leads to gaps with overestimated width,
especially at low viscosity. Here, we take into account the fraction of the
gravity torque that is evacuated by pressure supported waves. With a novel
approach, which consists of following the fluid elements along their
trajectories, we show that the flux of angular momentum carried by the waves
corresponds to a pressure torque. The equilibrium profile of the disk is then
set by the balance between gravity, viscous and pressure torques. We check that
this balance is satisfied in numerical simulations, with a planet on a fixed
circular orbit. We then use a reference numerical simulation to get an ansatz
for the pressure torque, that yields gap profiles for any value of the disk
viscosity, pressure scale height and planet to primary mass ratio. Those are in
good agreement with profiles obtained in numerical simulations over a wide
range of parameters. Finally, we provide a gap opening criterion that
simultaneously involves the planet mass, the disk viscosity and the aspect
ratio.

obtaining less detailed data on large numbers of objects in young star

detailed understanding of the physical processes involved in disk dissipation

the dispersion in disk lifetimes. The age at which evidence for inner accretion

date. Four of our likely radial velocity members of Carina lie outside of this
galaxy's nominal tidal radius, supporting earlier claims of the possible
existence of such stars beyond the main body of Carina. We find a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.7 dex. The formal full width at half maximum of the
metallicity distribution is 0.92 dex, while the full range of metallicities
spans ~-3.0<[Fe/H]<0.0 dex. The metallicity distribution might be indicative of
several subpopulations. There appears to be a mild radial gradient such that
more metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated, matching a similar
trend for an increasing fraction of intermediate-age stars. This as well as the
photometric colors of the more metal-rich red giants suggest that Carina
exhibits an age-metallicity relation. Indeed the age-metallicity degeneracy
seems to conspire to form a narrow red giant branch despite the considerable
spread in metallicity and wide range of ages. The metallicity distribution is
not well-matched by a simple closed-box model of chemical evolution, but
requires models that take into account also infall and outflows. (Abridged)

consistent with um-sized grains indicating fast grain growth (from 0.1--1.0 um
in radius). In addition, approximately half of the T Tauri star spectra show
crystalline silicate features near 28 and 33 um indicating significant
processing when compared to interstellar grains. A few sources show large
10-to-20 um ratios and require even larger grains emitting at 20 um than at 10
um. This size difference may arise from the difference in the depth into the
disk probed by the two silicate emission bands in disks where dust settling has
occurred. The 10 um feature strength vs. shape trend is not correlated with age
or Halpha equivalent width, suggesting that some amount of turbulent mixing and
regeneration of small grains is occurring. The strength vs. shape trend is
related to spectral type, however, with M stars showing significantly flatter
10 um features (larger grain sizes) than A/B stars. The connection between
spectral type and grain size is interpreted in terms of the variation in the
silicate emission radius as a function of stellar luminosity, but could also be
indicative of other spectral-type dependent factors (e.g, X-rays, UV radiation,
stellar/disk winds, etc.).

For the inner regions, the survey results are consistent with the findings of
previous narrower surveys. The core mass function resembles the stellar initial
mass function, with the core mass function shifted by a factor of two to higher
masses (for the chosen opacity and temperature). In addition, we find no
statistical variation in the core mass function between the crowded inner
regions and those in more isolated fields except for the absence of the most
massive cores in the extended cloud. The inner region contains compacter cores.
This is interpreted as due to a medium of higher mean pressure although strong
pressure variations are evident in each region. The cores display a
hierarchical spatial distribution with no preferred separation scale length.
However, the frequency distribution of nearest neighbours displays two peaks,
one of which at 5000AU can be the result of core fragmentation. The
orientations of the major axes of cores are consistent with an isotropic
distribution. In contrast, the relative orientations of core pairs are
preferentially in the NW-SE direction on all separation scales. These results
are consistent with core production and evolution in a turbulent environment.

automated source detection and position with few arcsecond accuracy within few

seconds; automatic adjusting of the CCD readout mode to optimize the science
return as the source fades. Swift main scientific goal is the study of
gamma-ray burst (GRBs). XRT can observe GRB afterglows over several orders of
magnitude in flux. The first results obtained during the first ten months of
operation confirm that XRT is fully compliant with the requirements and is
providing excellent results. In particular it is detecting a very steep decay
in the early X-ray light curve of many afterglows. Often there are also strong
flares superimposed to the X-ray light curve, probably related to the continued
internal engine activity. XRT is also localising for the first time the X-ray
counterparts to short bursts.

ground-based imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes allow us for the first
time to resolve the morphological structures of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) which
are older and more extended than the Crab Nebula. VHE gamma-ray observations of
such extended nebulae (with field strengths below ~ 20 micro Gauss) probe the
electron component corresponding to the unseen extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
synchrotron component, which measures electron injection from earlier
evolutionary epochs. VHE observations of PWN therefore introduce a new window
on PWN research. This review paper also identifies conditions for maximal VHE
visbility of PWN. Regarding pulsar pulsed emission, it is becoming clear that
the threshold energies of current telescopes are not sufficient to probe the
pulsed gamma-ray component from canonical pulsars. Theoretical estimates of
pulsed gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars seem to converge and it
becomes clear that such detections with current 3rd generation telescopes will
not be possible, unless the geometry is favourable.

observations of selected bright stars in order to allow the modelling of their
interior through asteroseismology. However, in order to interpret the
asteroseismological data, the effective temperature, surface gravity, and
chemical composition of the stars must be known with sufficient accuracy. To
carry out this task, we have developed a spectroscopic method called APASS
(Atmospheric Parameters and Abundances from Synthetic Spectra) which allows
precise analysis of stars with a moderate to high rotational velocity, which is
the case for most primary COROT targets. Our method is based on synthetic
spectra and works differentially with respect to the Sun. Using high
signal-to-noise spectra and the APASS method, we determined the atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances of 13 primary COROT targets. Our results
agree well with those obtained by Bruntt using his software VWA and with those
obtained with the software TEMPLOGG. However, in both cases, our error bars are
significantly smaller than those of other methods. Our effective temperatures
are also in excellent agreement with those obtained with the IR photometry
method. For five stars with relatively low rotational velocity, we also
performed an analysis with a classical equivalent-width method to test
agreement with APASS results. We show that equivalent-width measurements by
Gaussian or Voigt profile-fitting are sensitive to the rotational broadening,
leading to systematic errors whenever the projected rotation velocity is
non-negligible. The APASS method appears superior in all cases and should thus
be preferred.

emission of the white dwarf. Both the far-ultraviolet (FUV) flux as well as the
spectral shape vary substantially over the orbital period, with maximum flux
occurring at the same phase as during the high state. The variations are due to
the presence of a hot spot on the white dwarf, which we model quantitatively.
The white dwarf parameters can be determined from a spectral fit to the faint
phase data, when the hot spot is self-eclipsed. Adopting the distance of
79+8-6pc determined by Thorstensen, we find an effective temperature of
19800+-700K and a mass of Mwd=0.78+0.12-0.17Msun. The hot spot has a lower
temperature than during the high state, ~34000-40000K, but covers a similar
area, ~10% of the white dwarf surface. Low state FUSE and STIS spectra taken
during four different epochs in 2002/3 show no variation of the FUV flux level
or spectral shape, implying that the white dwarf temperature and the hot spot
temperature, size, and location do not depend on the amount of time the system
has spent in the low state. Possible explanations are ongoing accretion at a
low level, or deep heating, both alternatives have some weaknesses that we
discuss. No photospheric metal absorption lines are detected in the FUSE and
STIS spectra, suggesting that the average metal abundances in the white dwarf
atmosphere are lower than 1e-3 times their solar values.

thought that Population III stars were significantly more massive than the

produced significant cosmic infrared background radiation in the near-

reduce to the Drude result in the limit of a constant relaxation time. We also
explicitly demonstrate the equivalence between the Kubo and nonequilibrium
approaches to linear response. There are a number of interesting modifications
of the conventional quantum Boltzmann equation that arise due to the underlying

such shear localization can vary depending on the system being studied. A
number of the systems of interest are confined so as to be quasi-two
dimensional, and an important issue in these systems is the role of the
confining boundaries. For foams, three basic systems have been studied with
very different boundary conditions: Hele-Shaw cells (bubbles confined between
two solid plates); bubble rafts (a single layer of bubbles freely floating on a

surface of water below and a glass plate on top). Often, it is assumed that the

when externally imposed rates of strain are sufficiently smaller than internal
kinematic relaxation times. In this paper, we directly test this assumption for
rates of strain ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2} {\rm s^{-1}}$. This
corresponds to the quoted quasi-static limit in a number of previous
experiments. It is found that the top plate dramatically alters both the

scattering in a certain range of parameters, several types of non-Fermi-liquid

Luttinger liquid and, second, many-particle excitations due to two-channel

is exploited to control the electric resistance R of devices. One basic
building block is the spin-valve, which is formed if two ferromagnetic
electrodes are separated by a thin tunneling barrier. In such devices, R
depends on the orientation of the magnetisation of the electrodes. It is
usually larger in the antiparallel than in the parallel configuration. The
relative difference of R, the so-called magneto-resistance (MR), is then
positive. Common devices, such as the giant magneto-resistance sensor used in
reading heads of hard disks, are based on this phenomenon. The MR may become
anomalous (negative), if the transmission probability of electrons through the
device is spin or energy dependent. This offers a route to the realisation of
gate-tunable MR devices, because transmission probabilities can readily be
tuned in many devices with an electrical gate signal. Such devices have,
however, been elusive so far. We report here on a pronounced gate-field
controlled MR in devices made from carbon nanotubes with ferromagnetic
contacts. Both the amplitude and the sign of the MR are tunable with the gate
voltage in a predictable manner. We emphasise that this spin-field effect is
not restricted to carbon nanotubes but constitutes a generic effect which can
in principle be exploited in all resonant tunneling devices.

  citations and metadata",,,,"cs.LG cs.CC cs.MA",,"  Awerbuch et al.'s approach to distributed recommender systems (DRSs) is to
have agents sample products at random while randomly querying one another for
the best item they have found; we improve upon this by adding a communication
network. Agents can only communicate with their immediate neighbors in the
network, but neighboring agents may or may not represent users with common
interests. We define two network structures: in the ``mailing-list model,''
agents representing similar users form cliques, while in the ``word-of-mouth
model'' the agents are distributed randomly in a scale-free network (SFN). In
both models, agents tell their neighbors about satisfactory products as they
are found. In the word-of-mouth model, knowledge of items propagates only
through interested agents, and the SFN parameters affect the system's
performance. We include a summary of our new results on the character and
parameters of random subgraphs of SFNs, in particular SFNs with power-law
degree distributions down to minimum degree 1. These networks are not as
resilient as Cohen et al. originally suggested. In the case of the widely-cited
``Internet resilience'' result, high failure rates actually lead to the
orphaning of half of the surviving nodes after 60% of the network has failed
and the complete disintegration of the network at 90%. We show that given an
appropriate network, the communication network reduces the number of sampled
items, the number of messages sent, and the amount of ``spam.'' We conclude
that in many cases DRSs will be useful for sharing information in a multi-agent
learning system.

  Failures","12 pages, 7 figures. Submitting to Phys. Rev. Lett",,,,"cs.NI cs.AR cs.MA",,"  It is commonly believed that scale-free networks are robust to massive
numbers of random node deletions. For example, Cohen et al. study scale-free
networks including some which approximate the measured degree distribution of
the Internet. Their results suggest that if each node in this network failed
independently with probability 0.99, the remaining network would continue to
have a giant component. In this paper, we show that a large and important
subclass of scale-free networks are not robust to massive numbers of random
node deletions for practical purposes. In particular, we study finite
scale-free networks which have minimum node degree of 1 and a power-law degree
distribution beginning with nodes of degree 1 (power-law networks). We show
that, in a power-law network approximating the Internet's reported
distribution, when the probability of deletion of each node is 0.5 only about
25% of the surviving nodes in the network remain connected in a giant
component, and the giant component does not persist beyond a critical failure
rate of 0.9. The new result is partially due to improved analytical
accommodation of the large number of degree-0 nodes that result after node
deletions. Our results apply to finite power-law networks with a wide range of
power-law exponents, including Internet-like networks. We give both analytical
and empirical evidence that such networks are not generally robust to massive
random node deletions.

precise enough to unambiguously distinguish between the free string predictions
and those obtained using the N-G effective string. At large distances we find a
remarkable agreement between Monte Carlo data and N-G predictions for the first
excited energy level, while the free string picture is definitely excluded. As
the interquark distance is decreased (and/or the finite temperature becomes
higher) the Monte Carlo results show larger and larger deviations both from the
N-G and from the free string predictions. In order to better understand this
behaviour we re-derived the effective Nambu-Goto theory result for the Polyakov
loop correlator using a covariant quantization. We chose as boundary conditions
those of an open string attached to two D0-branes at spatial distance $R$, in a
target space with compact euclidean time. Obviously our treatment is fully
consistent only in $d=26$. The extension to generic $d$ requires taking into
account the Liouville mode of Polyakov's formulation. The analogy with the
standard light cone calculation suggests that the contribution due to the
Liouville field can be neglected for large $R$. At shorter scales, the
Liouville mode cannot be neglected and its contribution to the interquark
potential might be the source of the discrepancies with respect to the

amplitudes of light mesons describe the leading non-perturbative hadronic
contributions to exclusive QCD reactions at large energy transfer, for instance
electromagnetic form factors. Importantly, they also enter into the two-body B
decay amplitudes described by QCD factorisation. They cannot be calculated from
first principles and are described by models based on a fixed-order conformal
expansion, which is not always sufficient in phenomenological applications. We
derive new models that are valid to all orders in the conformal expansion and
characterised by a small number of parameters related to experimental
observables.Motivated by the marginal agreement between the QCD factorisation
results with the experimental data, in particular for $B\to\pi\pi$, we
scrutinise the incalculable non-factorisable corrections to charmless

subsequently move to the LHC. The current limits from the Tevatron and the
prospective sensitivities at the LHC are often interpreted in specific MSSM
scenarios. For heavy Higgs boson production and subsequent decay into b \bar b
or tau^+ tau^-, the present Tevatron data allow to set limits in the
M_A-tan_beta plane for small M_A and large tan_beta values. Similar channels
have been explored for the LHC, where the discovery reach extends to higher
values of M_A and smaller tan_beta. Searches for MSSM charged Higgs bosons,
produced in top decays or in association with top quarks, have also been
investigated at the Tevatron and the LHC. We analyze the current Tevatron
limits and prospective LHC sensitivities. We discuss how robust they are with
respect to variations of the other MSSM parameters and possible improvements of
the theoretical predictions for Higgs boson production and decay. It is shown
that the inclusion of supersymmetric radiative corrections to the production
cross sections and decay widths leads to important modifications of the present
limits on the MSSM parameter space. The impact on the region where only the
lightest MSSM Higgs boson can be detected at the LHC is also analyzed. We
propose to extend the existing benchmark scenarios by including additional
values of the higgsino mass parameter mu. This affects only slightly the search
channels for a SM-like Higgs boson, while having a major impact on the searches
for non-standard MSSM Higgs bosons.

neutrino flux published by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration is presented,
performed through a likelihood scan approach. Preliminarily a careful review of
the analysis methodology is given, showing that the traditional periodicity
search via the Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a special case of a more general
likelihood based method. Since the data are published together with the
relevant asymmetric errors, it is then shown how the likelihood analysis can be
performed either with or without a prior error averaging. A key point of this
work is the detailed illustration of the mathematical model describing the
statistical properties of the estimated spectra obtained in the various cases,
which is also validated through extensive Monte Carlo computations; the model
includes a calculation for the prediction of the possible alias effects. In the
successive investigation of the data, such a model is used to derive objective,
mathematical predictions which are quantitatively compared with the features
observed in the experimental spectra. This article clearly demonstrates that
the handling of the errors is the origin of the discrepancy between published
null observations and claimed significant periodicity in the same SK-I data
sample. Moreover, the comprehensive likelihood analysis with asymmetric errors
developed in this work provides results which cannot exclude the null
hypothesis of constant rate, even though some indications stemming from the
model at odd with such conclusion point towards the desirability of additional
investigations with alternative methods to shed further light on the
characteristics of the data.

representations of quantum doubles of the dihedral groups $D_n$. These results
may be used to determine constant solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation. We
then discuss Baxterisation ans\""atze to obtain solutions of the Yang--Baxter
equation with spectral parameter and give several examples, including a new
21-vertex model. We also describe this approach in terms of minimal-dimensional
representations of the quantum doubles of the alternating group $A_4$ and the
symmetric group $S_4$.

satisfactorily for even a single electron in a hydrogen atom is a formidable
mathematical task with the Schrodinger equation. Here the author puts forward a
new spacetime concept that regards space and time as two orthogonal, symmetric
and complementary quantities. They are inherent physical quantities that cannot
be divorced from physical objects themselves. In two-dimensional helium shell,
space and time are instantiated by two interactive 1s electrons; in
four-dimensional neon shell, space and time dimensions blend into four types of
curvilinear vectors represented by 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz electronic orbitals.
The description of electronic orbitals constitutes an explanation of canonical
spacetime properties such as harmonic oscillation, electromagnetism, and wave
propagation. Through differential and integral operations, the author
formulates a precise wavefunction for every electron in an inert neon atom
where spacetime, as dimensional graduated by ten electrons, is continuous, and

ensembles. A single photon is generated from a cold atomic ensemble at Site A
via the protocol of Duan, Lukin, Cirac, and Zoller (DLCZ) [Nature v.414, 413

photon is converted into a single collective excitation via the dark-state
polariton approach of Fleischhauer and Lukin [Phys. Rev. Lett. v.84, 5094

back into a single photon. This is demonstrated experimentally, for a storage
time of 500 nanoseconds, by measurement of an anticorrelation parameter a.
Storage times exceeding ten microseconds are observed by intensity
cross-correlation measurements. The length of the storage period is two orders
of magnitude longer than the time to achieve conversion between photonic and

potential barrier is a combined quantum process to consist from two elementary
sub-processes (transmission and reflection) evolved coherently at all stages of
scattering and macroscopically distinct at the final stage. The existing model
of the process is clearly inadequate to its nature: all one-particle
""observables"" and ""tunneling times"", introduced as quantities to be common for
the sub-processes, cannot be experimentally measured and, consequently, have no
physical meaning; on the contrary, quantities introduced for either sub-process
have no basis, for the time evolution of either sub-process is unknown in this
model. We show that the wave function to describe a completed scattering can be
uniquely presented as the sum of two solutions to the Schr\""odinger equation,
which describe separately the sub-processes at all stages of scattering. For
symmetric potential barriers such solutions are found explicitly. For either
sub-process we define the time spent, on the average, by a particle in the
barrier region. We define it as the Larmor time. As it turned out, this time is
just Buttiker's dwell time averaged over the corresponding localized state.
Thus, firstly, we justify the known definition of the local dwell time
introduced by Hauge and co-workers as well by Leavens and Aers, for now this
time can be measured; secondly, we confirm that namely Buttiker's dwell time
gives the energy-distribution for the tunneling time; thirdly, we state that
all the definitions are valid only if they are based on the wave functions for
transmission and reflection found in our paper. Besides, we define the exact
and asymptotic group times to be auxiliary in timing the scattering process.

by the spin-chain may reach one, and it can signal very well the critical
points of the chain. A physical understanding and experimental realization with
trapped ions are presented.

novel configuration of electro-magnetically induced transparency. We show that
a giant Kerr nonlinearity with a relatively large cross-phase modulation
coefficient that occurs in such system may be used to produce an efficient
photon-photon entanglement. We demonstrate that such photon-photon entanglement
is practically controllable and hence facilitates promising applications in
quantum information and computation.
