is the first in-depth analysis of an extended VHE gamma-ray source, we present
a thorough discussion of our methodology and investigations of possible sources
of systematic errors. Gamma rays are detected throughout the whole SNR. The
emission is found to resemble a shell structure with increased fluxes from the
western and northwestern parts. The differential gamma-ray spectrum of the
whole SNR is measured over more than two orders of magnitude, from 190 GeV to
40 TeV, and is rather hard with indications for a deviation from a pure power
law at high energies. Spectra have also been determined for spatially separated
regions of RX J1713.7-3946. The flux values vary by more than a factor of two,
but no significant change in spectral shape is found. There is a striking
correlation between the X-ray and the gamma-ray image. Radial profiles in both
wavelength regimes reveal the same shape almost everywhere in the region of the
SNR. The VHE gamma-ray emission of RX J1713.7-3946 is phenomenologically
discussed for two scenarios, one where the gamma rays are produced by VHE
electrons via Inverse Compton scattering and one where the gamma rays are due
to neutral pion decay from proton-proton interactions. In conjunction with
multi-wavelength considerations, the latter case is favoured. However, no
decisive conclusions can yet be drawn regarding the parent particle population

higher oscillator strength, are preferentially scattered out of the line of
sight, thus reducing the observed line ratio. Recent laboratory measurements,
however, have found significant inner-shell Fe XVI lines at 15.21 and 15.26
Angstroms, suggesting that the observed 3C/3D ratio results from blending.
Given our new understanding of the fundamental spectroscopy, we have
re-examined the original solar spectra, identifying the Fe XVI 15.21 line and
measuring its flux to account for the contribution of Fe XVI to the 15.26 flux.
Deblending brings the 3C/3D ratio into good agreement with the experimental

XVII 15.01 also implies low opacity for Fe XV 284.2, ruling out resonance
scattering as the cause of the fuzziness of TRACE and SOHO EIT 284-Angstrom

use other independent observational tools. For this purpose, we consider the
$w$ dependence of the non-Gaussianity of the density distribution generated by
nonlinear dynamics. To extract the non-Gaussianity, we follow a semi-analytic
approach based on Lagrangian linear perturbation theory, which provides an
accurate value for the quasi-nonlinear region. From our results, the difference
of the non-Gaussianity between $w = -1$ and $w= -0.5$ is about 4% while that
between $w = -1$ and $w= -0.8$ is about $0.9 %$. For the highly non-linear
region, we estimate the difference by combining this perturbative approach with
N-body simulation executed for our previous paper. From this, we can expect the
difference to be more enhanced in the low-$z$ region, which suggests that the
non-Gaussianity of the density distribution potentially plays an important role
for extracting the information of dark energy.

acceleration in the outer magnetosphere of a pulsar. The charge depletion from
the Goldreich-Julian charge density causes a large electric field along the
magnetic field lines. The charge particles are accelerated by the electric
field and emit $\gamma$-rays via the curvature process. Some of the emitted
$\gamma$-rays may collide with $X$-ray photons to make new pairs, which are
accelerated again on the different field lines in the gap and proceed similar
processes. We simulate the pair creation cascade in the meridional plane using
the pair creation mean-free path, in which the $X$-ray photon number density is
proportional to inverse square of radial distance. With the space charge
density determined by the pair creation simulation, we solve the electric
structure of the outer gap in the meridional plane and calculate the curvature
spectrum.
  Because the two-dimensional model can link both gap width along the magnetic
field line and trans-field thickness with the spectral cut-off energy and flux,
we can diagnose both the current through the gap and inclination angle between
the rotational and magnetic axes. We apply the theory to the Vela pulsar. By
comparing the results with the $EGRET$ data, we rule out any cases that have a
large particle injection at the outer boundary. We also suggest the inclination
angle of $\alpha_{inc}\geq65^{\circ}$. The present model predicts the outer gap
starting from near the conventional null charge surface for the Vela pulsar.

different from that of the total 60-um LF (Takeuchi et al. 2003): the bright
end of the LF declines more steeply than that of the 60-um LF. This behavior is
quantitatively similar to the LF of the cool subsample of the IRAS PSCz
galaxies. We also estimated the strength of the evolution of the LF by assuming
the pure luminosity evolution (PLE): L(z) \propto (1+z)^Q. We obtained
Q=5.0^{+2.5}_{-0.5} which is similar to the value obtained by recent Spitzer
observations, in spite of the limited sample size. Then, integrating over the
170-um LF, we obtained the local luminosity density at 170um, \rho_L(170um). A
direct integration of the LF gives \rho_L(170um) = 1.1 \times 10^8 h Lsun
Mpc^{-3}, whilst if we assume a strong PLE with Q=5, the value is 5.2 \times
10^7 h Lsun Mpc^{-3}. This is a considerable contribution to the local FIR
luminosity density. By summing up with other available infrared data, we
obtained the total dust luminosity density in the Local Universe,
\rho_L(dust)=1.1 \times 10^8 h Lsun Mpc^{-3}. Using this value, we estimated
the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density hidden by dust in the Local

evolution of the galaxy and its substructures archives until $z = 2.0$. In such
a high-redshift universe, the Einstein-de Sitter universe is still a good
approximation for a recently favored $\Lambda$-dominated universe, and then our
results does not depend on the choice of cosmology. In order to resolve small
gravitationally-bound clumps around galaxies and consider radiative cooling
below $T = 10^4 K$, we adopt a fine mass resolution ($m_{\rm SPH} = 1.12 \times
10^3 \Msun$). Because of the cooling, each clump immediately forms a
`core-halo' structure which consists of a baryonic core and a dark matter halo.
The tidal force from the host galaxy mainly strips the dark matter halo from
clumps and, as a result, theses clumps get dominated by baryons. Once a clump
is captured by the host halo, its mass drastically decreases each pericenter
passage. At $z = 2$, more than half of the clumps become baryon dominated
systems (baryon mass/total mass $> 0.5$). Our results support the tidal
evolution scenario of the formation of globular clusters and baryon dominated
dwarf galaxies in the context of the cold dark matter universe.

estimate of the baryon density of the Universe. In the framework of the
standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), such a baryon density leads to
predictions for the primordial abundances of $^{4}$He and D in good agreement
with observations. However, it also leads to a significant discrepancy between
the predicted and observed primordial abundance of $^{7}$Li. Such a discrepancy
is often termed as 'the lithium problem'. In this paper, we analyze this
problem in the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. It is shown that
an expansion of the Universe slightly slower than in General Relativity before
BBN, but faster during BBN, solves the lithium problem and leads to $^4$He and
D primordial abundances consistent with the observational constraints. This
kind of behavior is obtained in numerous scalar-tensor models, both with and
without a self-interaction potential for the scalar field. In models with a
self-interacting scalar field, the convergence towards General Relativity is
ensured without any condition, thanks to an attraction mechanism which starts
to work during the radiation-dominated epoch.

astrophysical accretion disks and their associated winds and jets. For example,
the rotation of the disk twists around the rotation axis the initially vertical
magnetic field, which responds by slowing down the plasma in the disk and by
causing it to fall towards the central star. The magnetic energy flux produced
in this process points away from the disk, pushing the surface plasma outwards,
leading to a wind from the disk and sometimes a collimated jet. But these
predictions have hitherto not been supported by observations. Here we report
the direct detection of the magnetic field in the core of the protostellar
accretion disk FU Orionis. The surface field reaches strengths of about 1 kG
close to the centre of the disk, and it includes a significant azimuthal
component, in good agreement with recent models. But we find that the field is
very filamentary and slows down the disk plasma much more than models predict,
which may explain why FU Ori fails to collimate its wind into a jet.

with MAGNUM telescope since early 2001, clear time-delayed response of the
K-band flux variations to the V-band flux variations was detected for all of
these galaxies. Their H-K color temperature was estimated to be 1500-1800 K
from the observed flux variation gradients, which supports a view that the bulk
of the K flux should originate in the thermal radiation of hot dust that
surrounds the central engine. Cross-correlation analysis was performed to
quantify the lag time corresponding to the light-travel distance of the hot
dust region from the central engine. The measured lag time is 47-53 days for
NGC 5548, 11-18 days for NGC 4051, about 20 days for NGC 3227, and 65-87 days
for NGC 7469. We found that the lag time is tightly correlated with the optical
luminosity as expected from dust reverberation ($\Delta t \propto L^{0.5}$),
while only weakly with the central virial mass, which suggests that an inner
radius of the dust torus around the active nucleus has a one-to-one
correspondence to central luminosity. In the lag time versus central luminosity
diagram, the K-band lag times place an upper boundary on the similar lag times
of broad-emission lines in the literature. This not only supports the unified
scheme of AGNs, but also implies a physical transition from the BLR out to the
dust torus that encircles the BLR. Furthermore, our V-band flux variations of
NGC 5548 on timescales of up to 10 days are found to correlate with X-ray
variations and delay behind them by one or two days, indicating the thermal
reprocessing of X-ray emission by the central accretion flow.

limit given that galaxies on the faint-end of the luminosity function are not

function luminosity suggests that galaxies with luminosity less than L^{\star}$

power spectrum, properly accounting for the non-Gaussian correlations between
the power on different scales, with that of the unlensed CMB fields and the
lensing potential. The latter represent the products of an (idealised) optimal
analysis that exploits the lens-induced non-Gaussianity to reconstruct the
fields. Compressing the non-Gaussian lensed CMB into power spectra is wasteful
and leaves a tight degeneracy between the equation of state of dark energy and
neutrino mass that is much stronger than in the more optimal analysis. Despite
this, a power spectrum analysis will be a useful first step in analysing future
B-mode polarization data. For this reason, we also consider how to extract
accurate parameter constraints from the lensed B-mode power spectrum. We show
with simulations that for cosmic-variance-limited measurements of the lensed
B-mode power, including the non-Gaussian correlations in existing likelihood
approximations gives biased parameter results. We develop a more refined
likelihood approximation that performs significantly better. This new
approximation should also be of more general interest in the wider context of
parameter estimation from Gaussian CMB data.

models, we consider in this paper the well known vortex duality, in particular
in the quantum interpretation in 2+1D where it is associated with the quantum
phase transition from a superfluid to a Bose Mott insulator. Here, the
disordered Mott insulating state is at the same time a dual superconductor
corresponding with a Bose condensate of vortices. We present a simple formalism
making it possible to compute the velocity propagator associated with the

insulator is characterized by a doublet of massive modes and we demonstrate
that one of these modes is nothing else than the longitudinal photon (gauged
second sound) of the dual superconductor. For increasing momenta, the system
rediscovers the original order, and the effect on the velocity correlator is
that the longitudinal photon looses its pole strength. The quantum critical
regime as probed by the velocity correlator is most interesting. We demonstrate
that at infinite wavelength the continua of critical modes associated with
second sound and the dual longitudinal photon are indistinguishable. However,
at finite momenta they behave differently, tracking the weight reshuffling
found in the quasiparticle spectrum of the disorder state closely.

to the metric Ramsey problem for large distortion (a.k.a. the non-linear
version of the isomorphic Dvoretzky theorem, as introduced by Bourgain, Figiel,
and Milman). We then proceed to construct optimal Ramsey partitions, and use
them to show that for every e\in (0,1), any n-point metric space has a subset
of size n^{1-e} which embeds into Hilbert space with distortion O(1/e). This
result is best possible and improves part of the metric Ramsey theorem of
Bartal, Linial, Mendel and Naor, in addition to considerably simplifying its

distance oracles when the distortion is large, closing a gap left open by
Thorup and Zwick. Namely, we show that for any $n$ point metric space X, and
k>1, there exists an O(k)-approximate distance oracle whose storage requirement

determination depends on the true values of $\theta_{13}$ and $\theta_{23}$, as

an accurate reconstruction of the energy and direction of the neutrino greatly
improves the sensitivity to the type of neutrino mass spectrum. For

the marginal case of the discrete two-dimensional Manakov system, the

unstable. Analytical predictions are corroborated with numerical observations

measure of the local charge correlation length, it is capable of detecting
inhomogeneity in the hot and dense matter created by heavy ion collisions. We
predict that going from peripheral to central collisions, the charge transfer
fluctuations at midrapidity should decrease substantially while the charge
transfer fluctuations at the edges of the observation window should decrease by
a small amount. These are consequences of having a strongly inhomogeneous
matter where the QGP component is concentrated around midrapidity. We also show
how to constrain the values of the charge correlations lengths in both the
hadronic phase and the QGP phase using the charge transfer fluctuations.

schematic representation of the baroclinic conversion processes which
characterize the physics of the mid-latitudes atmospheric circulation. The
model is relaxed towards a given latitudinal temperature profile, which acts as
baroclinic forcing, controlled by a parameter TE determining the forced
equator-to-pole temperature gradient. As TE increases, a transition takes place
from a stationary regime to a periodic regime, and eventually to an earth-like
chaotic regime where evolution takes place on a strange attractor. The
dependence of the attractor dimension, metric entropy, and bounding box volume
in phase space is studied by varying both TE and model resolution. The
statistical properties of observables having physical relevance, namely the
total energy of the system and the latitudinally averaged zonal wind, are also
examined. It is emphasized that while the attractor's properties are quite
sensitive to model resolution, the global physical observables depend less
critically on it. For more detailed physical observables, such as the
latitudinal profiles of the zonal wind, model resolution again may be critical:
the effectiveness of the zonal wind convergence, acting as barotropic
stabilization of the baroclinic waves, heavily relies on the details of the
latitudinal structure of the fields. The necessity and complementarity of both
the dynamical systems and physical approach is underlined.

sufficiently large environment) is in a quantum pure state subject to a global
constraint, and thermalisation results from entanglement between system and
environment. We formulate and prove a ""General Canonical Principle"", which
states that the system will be thermalised for almost all pure states of the
universe, and provide rigorous quantitative bounds using Levy's Lemma.

atoms in a planar geometry. The set-up allows the experimental study of
classical and quantum Hall effects in close analogy to solid-state systems
including the possibility of finite currents. The present scheme is an
extention of the proposal in Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 033602 (2004) where the
effective magnetic field is now induced for three-level Lambda-type atoms by
two counterpropagating laser beams with shifted spatial profiles. Under
conditions of electromagentically induced transparency the atom-light
interaction has a space dependent dark state, and the adiabatic center of mass
motion of atoms in this state experiences effective vector and scalar
potentials. The associated magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the
propagation direction of the laser beams. The field strength achievable is one
flux quantum over an area given by the transverse beam separation and the laser
wavelength. For a sufficiently dilute gas the field is strong enough to reach
the lowest Landau level regime.

"quant-ph/0511229","Alessandro Sergi","Alessandro Sergi","Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Wave Fields","Manuscript accepted by The Journal of Chemical Physics",,,,"quant-ph",,"  An approach to the quantum-classical mechanics of phase space dependent
operators, which has been proposed recently, is remodeled as a formalism for
wave fields. Such wave fields obey a system of coupled non-linear equations
that can be written by means of a suitable non-Hamiltonian bracket. As an
example, the theory is applied to the relaxation dynamics of the spin-boson
model. In the adiabatic limit, a good agreement with calculations performed by
the operator approach is obtained. Moreover, the theory proposed in this paper
can take nonadiabatic effects into account without resorting to surface-hopping
approximations. Hence, the results obtained follow qualitatively those of
previous surface-hopping calculations and increase by a factor of (at least)
two the time length over which nonadiabatic dynamics can be propagated with
small statistical errors. Moreover, it is worth to note that the dynamics of
quantum-classical wave fields here proposed is a straightforward
non-Hamiltonian generalization of the formalism for non-linear quantum
mechanics that Weinberg introduced recently.

standard notion of mass to quarks and recall the arguments that there should be
a close connection between the properties of elementary particles and the arena
used for the description of classical macroscopic processes.
  Motivated by the above and the wish to introduce more symmetry between the
coordinates of position and momentum we concentrate on the classical
nonrelativistic phase space with ${\bf {p}}^2+{\bf {x}}^2$ as an invariant. A
symmetry-based argument on how to generalize the way in which mass enters into
our description of Nature is presented and placed into the context of the
phase-space scheme discussed.
  It is conjectured that the proposed non-standard way of relating ""mass"" to
the variables of the classical phase space is actually used in Nature, and that
it manifests itself through the existence of quarks. Some properties of this
proposal, including unobservability of ""free quarks"" and the emergence of
mesons, are discussed.

Rubidium 87 atom in an optical dipole trap. Due to light-induced two-body
collisions during the loading stage of the trap the maximum number of captured
atoms is locked to one. This collisional blockade effect is confirmed by the
observation of photon anti-bunching in the detected fluorescence light. The
spectral properties of single photons emitted by the atom were studied with a
narrow-band scanning cavity. We find that the atomic fluorescence spectrum is
dominated by the spectral width of the exciting laser light field. In addition
we observe a spectral broadening of the atomic fluorescence light due to the
Doppler effect. This allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the
trapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 micro Kelvin. This simple
single-atom trap is the key element for the generation of atom-photon
entanglement required for future applications in quantum communication and a
first loophole-free test of Bell's inequality.
