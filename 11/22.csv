We compare our results with the expectations from a unification model that
ascribes the difference between these two types of sources to the viewing angle
to the line of sight, beaming and the presence of a dust and gas torus. We find
that the spectrum of all the quasars can be fitted with a single power law, and
that the spectral index flattens with decreasing angle to the line of sight. We
interpret this as the effect of increasingly dominant inverse Compton X-ray
emission, beamed such that the jet emission outshines other core components.
For up to 70 per cent of the radio galaxies we detect intrinsic absorption;
their core spectra are best fitted with an unabsorbed steep power law of
average spectral index $\Gamma=2.1$ and an absorbed power law of spectral index
Gamma=1.6, which is flatter than that observed for radio-quiet quasars. We
further conclude that the presence of a jet affects the spectral properties of
absorbed nuclear emission in AGN. In radio galaxies, any steep-spectrum
component of nuclear X-ray emission, similar to that seen in radio-quiet
quasars, must be masked by a jet or by jet-related emission.

reionization is the impact of small-mass gravitationally-bound structures. We
carry out the first numerical investigation of the role of such sterile
`minihaloes', which serve as self-shielding screens of ionizing photons.
Minihaloes are too small to be properly resolved in current large-scale
cosmological simulations, and thus we estimate their effects using a sub-grid
model, considering two cases that bracket their effect within this framework.
In the `extreme suppression' case in which minihalo formation ceases once a
region is partially ionized, their effect on cosmic reionization is modest,
reducing the volume-averaged ionization fraction by an overall factor of less
than 15%. In the other extreme, in which minihalo formation is never
suppressed, they delay complete reionization as much as Delta z~2, in rough
agreement with the results from a previous semi-analytical study by the
authors. Thus, depending on the details of the minihalo formation process,
their effect on the overall progress of reionization can range from modest to
significant, but the minihalo photon consumption is by itself insufficient to
force an extended reionization epoch.

noiseless CMB realization which contains only E-modes. Recently, Challinor &
Chon showed that for moderately sized surveys ($f_{sky} \sim 0.01$), this
mixing limits the gravity wave B-mode signal which can be detected using
pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators to $T/S \sim 0.05$. We modify the pseudo-$C_\ell$

probability that a single isolated lens will produce a detectable event. The
high probability is caused by some combination of a large Einstein angle, fast
angular motion, and a dense background field. We refer to high-probability
lenses as mesolenses. The mesolensing regime is complementary to the regime in
which the optical depth is high, in that it applies to isolated lenses instead
of to dense lens fields. Mesolensing is complementary to microlensing, because
it is well suited to the study of different lens populations, and also because
different observing and analysis strategies are required to optimize the
discovery and study of mesolenses. Planetary and stellar masses located within
1-2 kpc are examples of mesolenses. We show that their presence can be detected
against a wide variety of background fields, using distinctive signatures of
both time variability and spatial effects. Time signatures can be identical to
those of microlensing, but can also include baseline jitter, extreme apparent
chromaticity, events well fit by lens models in which several independent
sources are simultaneously lensed, and sequences of events. Spatial signatures

representative of the initial properties of globular clusters rather than of
the highly evolved core quantities. Models indicate the half-light quantities
best reflect the initial conditions, so we examine whether the associated
dynamical interaction rate, proportional to L^1.5 r^-2.5, is useful in
understanding the presence of luminous LMXBs in the Galactic globular cluster
system. We find that while LMXB clusters with large values of L^1.5 r^-2.5
preferentially host LMXBs, the systems must also have half-mass relaxation
times below about 1E9 yr. This relaxation time effect probably occurs because
several relaxation times are required to modify binary separations, a timescale
that must be shorter than cluster ages. The frequency of finding an LMXB
cluster is enhanced if the cluster is metal-rich and if it is close to the
bulge region. The dependence upon metallicity is most likely due either to
differing initial mass functions at the high mass end, or because bulge systems
evolve more rapidly from tidal interactions with the bulge. This approach can
be used to investigate globular cluster systems in external galaxies, where
core properties are unresolved.

observations to both investigate the frequency and nature of the circumstellar
disk population in the cluster. The observations are sufficiently sensitive to
enable the first detailed measurement of the disk frequency for very low mass
stars at the peak of the stellar IMF. Using measurements of infrared excess
between 3.6 and 8 microns we find the total frequency of disk-bearing stars in
the cluster to be 50 +/- 6%. However, only 30 +/- 4% of the member stars are
surrounded by optically thick, primordial disks, while the remaining
disk-bearing stars are surrounded by what appear to be optically thin,anemic
disks. The disk fraction appears to be a function of spectral type and stellar
mass. The disk longevity and thus conditions for planet formation appear to be
most favorable for stars which are of comparable mass to the sun. The optically
thick disks around later type (> M4) stars appear to be less flared than the
disks around earlier type stars. This may indicate a greater degree of dust
settling and a more advanced evolutionary state for the late M disk population.
Finally we find that the presence of an optically thick dust disk is correlated
with gaseous accretion as measured by the strength of Halpha emission. These
results suggest that it is more likely for dust disks to persist in the absence
of active gaseous accretion than for active accretion to persist in the absence
of dusty disks.

broad-band (far-ultraviolet through far-red) spectral energy distribution for

fit to the data, and we derive the corresponding stellar parameters.
  All of our findings are consistent with BSS-7 being a detached binary
consisting of a blue straggler primary with an X-ray-active,
upper-main-sequence companion. The formation of such a system would necessarily
involve at least three stars, which is consistent with recent N-body models in
which blue stragglers often form via multiple encounters that can involve both
single and binary stars. However, we cannot yet entirely rule out the
possibility that BSS-7 descended directly from a binary system via mass
transfer. The system parameters needed to distinguish definitively between
these scenarios may be obtainable from time-resolved spectroscopy.

models in which energy transfer is described by a Cardassian like term in the
relation of $H^{2}(z)$, where $H$ is Hubble's function and $z$ is redshift. The
considered models have two additional parameters $(\Omega_{\text{int}},n)$
(apart the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM model) which can be tested using SNIa

We also confront the quality of statistical fits for both the $\Lambda$CDM

informative criteria. Our conclusion from standard best fit method is that the
interacting models explains the acceleration of the Universe better but they
give rise to a universe with high matter density. However, using the tools of
information criteria we find that the two new parameters play an insufficient
role in improving the fit to SNIa data and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is
still preferred. We conclude that high precision detection of high redshift

describes the orbital evolution quite accurately, when the Coulomb logarithm is
chosen appropriately. However, it is not known if the orbital evolution of a
real satellite with the internal degree of freedom can be described by the
dynamical friction formula. We performed N-body simulation of the orbital
evolution of a self-consistent satellite galaxy within a self-consistent parent
galaxy. We found that the orbital decay of the simulated satellite is
significantly faster than the estimate from the dynamical friction formula. The
main cause of this discrepancy is that the stars stripped out of the satellite
are still close to the satellite, and increase the drag force on the satellite
through two mechanisms. One is the direct drag force from particles in the
trailing tidal arm, a non-axisymmetric force that slows the satellite down. The
other is the indirect effect that is caused by the particles remaining close to
the satellite after escape. The force from them enhances the wake caused in the
parent galaxy by dynamical friction, and this larger wake in turn slows the
satellite down more than expected from the contribution of its bound mass. We
found these two have comparable effects, and the combined effect can be as
large as 20% of the total drag force on the satellite.

particular, singularities (non-analyticities) separating different microscopic
phases. These microscopic phases may be identified as different microphysical
dissociation states of the small system. The microscopic oscillations of
microcanonical thermodynamic quantities (e.g. temperature, heat capacity, or
pressure) should in principle be observable in suitably designed
evaporation/dissociation experiments (which must realize the physical
preconditions of the microcanonical ensemble). By contrast, singular phase
transitions cannot occur, if a small system is embedded into an infinite heat
bath (thermostat), corresponding to the canonical ensemble. For the simple
model systems under consideration, it is nevertheless possible to identify a
smooth canonical phase transition by studying the distribution of complex zeros
of the canonical partition function.

Using a random-graph framework, we analyze our method both mathematically and

between the expected number of nodes that receive the vaccine and the network's
resulting vulnerability to develop an epidemic as the virus or worm attempts to
infect one of its nodes. For some scenarios, the new method is seen to render
the network practically invulnerable to attacks while requiring only a small

entails that to any spacetime is associated a unique gauge group, up to
isomorphisms, and that to any embedding between two spacetimes there
corresponds a group morphism between the related gauge groups. This form of
covariance between sectors also brings to light the issue whether local and

careful analysis of the gauge symmetries of the system uncovers new subtleties
leading to modifications of the worldsheet results. The compactification on a
Euclidean thermal circle is particularly interesting. It leads us to an
incompatibility between T-duality (and its corresponding gauge symmetry) and
locality.

vertices which begins with the edgeless graph, and where at each step a single
edge is added according to a uniform distribution on the missing edges. It is
well known that in such a process a giant component (of linear size) typically
emerges after $(1+o(1))\frac{n}{2}$ edges (a phenomenon known as ``the double
jump''), i.e., at time $t=1$ when using a timescale of $n/2$ edges in each
step.
  We consider a generalization of this process, $\Gorg[K](n)$, which gives a
weight of size 1 to missing edges between pairs of isolated vertices, and a
weight of size $K \in [0,\infty)$ otherwise. This corresponds to a case where
links are added between $n$ initially isolated settlements, where the
probability of a new link in each step is biased according to whether or not
its two endpoint settlements are still isolated.
  Combining methods of \cite{SpencerWormald} with analytical techniques, we
describe the typical emerging time of a giant component in this process,
$t_c(K)$, as the singularity point of a solution to a set of differential
equations. We proceed to analyze these differential equations and obtain
properties of $\Gorg$, and in particular, we show that $t_c(K)$ strictly
decreases from 3/2 to 0 as $K$ increases from 0 to $\infty$, and that $t_c(K) =
\frac{4}{\sqrt{3K}}(1 + o(1))$. Numerical approximations of the differential
equations agree both with computer simulations of the process $\Gorg(n)$ and

fact, probabilistic models that naturally arise in statistical mechanics have
been widely studied by mathematicians for the very challenging and novel
problems that they pose. The physical situation that we consider in this thesis
is that of a polymer in the proximity of an interface between two selective
solvents, in the case when the interaction of the monomers with the solvents
and the interface may vary from monomer to monomer (inhomogeneous polymer). In
interesting cases thee is a phase transition between a state in which the
polymer sticks very close to the interface (localized regime) and a state in
which it wanders away from it (delocalized regime). The mechanism underlying
such a transition is an energy/entropy competition.
  Our task has been to study random walk models of polymer chains with the
purpose of understanding this competition in a deep and quantitative way.
Despite the fact that the definition of these models is extremely elementary,
their analysis is not simple at all, and several interesting questions are
still open. In this Ph.D. thesis we present new results that answer some of
these questions. The analysis performed has required the application of a wide
range of techniques, including large deviations, concentration inequalities,
renewal theory, fluctuation theory for random walks. A numerical and
statistical study has been performed too. Finally we prove a local limit
theorem for random walks conditioned to stay positive.

approximation to the solution is a single soliton. It is not integrable for any
other zero-order solution. In the standard application of a Normal Form
expansion, integrability is recovered if, from second order onwards, the
perturbation obeys algebraic constraints. In general, these are not satisfied.
As a result, the Normal Form is not asymptotically integrable; its solution,
the zero-order approximation, loses the simple structure of the solution of the
unperturbed equation. This work exploits the freedom in the perturbative
expansion to propose an alternative, for which the loss of integrability only
affects higher-order terms in the expansion of the solution. The Normal Form
remains asymptotically integrable, and the zero-order approximation, not
affected by the loss of integrability, has the same structure as the solution
of the unperturbed equation. In the case of a multiple-soliton zero-order
approximation, the loss of integrability affects the higher-order corrections
to the solution in a finite domain around the origin in the x-t plane, the
soliton interaction region. The effect decays exponentially in all directions
in the plane as the distance from the origin grows. The computation is carried

  PrP106-126","16 pages, 14 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  Mouse prion protein PrP106-126 is a peptide corresponding to the residues
107-127 of human prion protein. It has been shown that PrP106-126 can reproduce
the main neuropathological features of prionrelated transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies and can form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The conformational
characteristics of PrP106-126 fibril have been investigated by electron
microscopy, CD spectroscopy, NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. Recent
researches have found out that PrP106-126 in water assumes a stable structure
consisting of two parallel beta-sheets that are tightly packed against each
other. In this work we perform molecular dynamics simulation to reveal the
elongation mechanism of PrP106-126 fibril. Influenced by the edge strands of
the fibril which already adopt beta-sheets conformation, single PrP106-126
peptide forms beta-structure and becomes a new element of the fibril. Under
acidic condition, single PrP106-126 peptide adopts a much larger variety of
conformations than it does under neural condition, which makes a peptide easier
to be influenced by the edge strands of the fibril. However, acidic condition
dose not largely affect the stability of PrP106-126 peptide fibril. Thus, the
speed of fibril elongation can be dramatically increased by lowering the pH
value of the solution. The pH value was adjusted by either changing the
protonation state of the residues or adding hydronium ions (acidic solution) or
hydroxyl ions (alkaline solution). The differences between these two approaches
are analyzed here.
