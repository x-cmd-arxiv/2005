slow down as they lose angular momentum to the halo through dynamical friction.
Angular momentum exchanges between the bar and halo particles take place at
resonances. While some particles gain and others lose, friction arises when
there is an excess of gainers over losers. This imbalance results from the
generally decreasing numbers of particles with increasing angular momentum, and
friction can therefore be avoided if there is no gradient in the density of
particles across the major resonances. Here we show that anomalously weak
friction can occur for this reason if the pattern speed of the bar fluctuates
upwards. After such an event, the density of resonant halo particles has a
local inflexion created by the earlier exchanges, and bar slowdown can be
delayed for a long period; we describe this as a metastable state. We show that
this behavior in purely collisionless N-body simulations is far more likely to
occur in methods with adaptive resolution. We also show that the phenomenon
could arise in nature, since bar-driven gas inflow could easily raise the bar
pattern speed enough to reach the metastable state. Finally, we demonstrate
that mild external, or internal, perturbations quickly restore the usual
frictional drag, and it is unlikely therefore that a strong bar in a galaxy
having a dense halo could rotate for a long period without friction.

linked to the formation of galaxies, but there have been few concrete

Investigating the connection between AGN and starburst activity may offer some
empirical guidance on this problem. I summarize previous observational searches
for young stars in active galaxies, concluding that there is now compelling
evidence for a significant post-starburst population in many luminous AGNs, and
that a direct, causal link may exist between star formation and black hole
accretion. Quantifying the ongoing star formation rate in AGNs, however, is
much more challenging because of the strong contamination by the active
nucleus. I discuss recent work attempting to measure the star formation rate in
luminous AGNs and quasars. The exceptionally low level of coeval star formation
found in these otherwise gas-rich systems suggests that the star formation
efficiency in the host galaxies is suppressed in the presence of strong AGN
feedback.

of the Randall-Sundrum type II braneworld scenario, as motivated by the AdS/CFT
correspondence, are investigated. High energy corrections to the standard
four-dimensional Friedmann equation induce a corresponding modification to the
form of the single-field inflationary consistency equation based on Einstein
gravity. The degree of departure from the standard expression is determined by
the ratio, r, of the primordial tensor and scalar perturbation amplitudes and
the coefficient, c, of the conformal anomaly in the dual gauge theory. It is
found that a necessary condition for detecting such a correction with the next
generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments is
that r >= 0.06. The bound is tightened to r > 0.3 for values of the central
charge that are compatible with known compactifications of type IIB string
theory as parametrized in terms of F-theory compactification on Calabi-Yau
four-folds. This is close to the present upper bounds inferred from combined
observations of the CMB anisotropy power spectrum and high redshift surveys. We
conclude that if such modifications to the inflationary consistency equation
are to be observable, the gravitational wave background should be detected in
the near future. A further consequence of the non-standard dynamics at high
energies is that the initial state of the universe is a quiescent singularity
with a finite density and pressure.

particle in terms of Riemannian geometry, as pattern for subsequent
developments. In fact, we use this scheme for further generalisation devoted to

particles.
  For constrained systems we have intrinsic and extrinsic viewpoints, with
respect to the environmental space. In the second case, we obtain an explicit
formula for the reaction force via the second fundamental form of the
constrained configuration space. For multi--particle systems we describe
geometrically the splitting related to the center of mass and relative
velocities; in this way we emphasise the geometric source of classical
formulas.
  Then, the above scheme is applied in detail to discrete rigid systems. We
start by analysing the geometry of the rigid configuration space. In this way
we recover the classical formula for the velocity of the rigid system via the
parallelisation of Lie groups. Moreover, we study in detail the splitting of
the tangent and cotangent environmental space into the three components of
center of mass, of relative velocities and of the orthogonal subspace. This
splitting yields the classical components of linear and angular momentum (which
here arise from a purely geometric construction) and, moreover, a third non
standard component. The third projection yields an explicit formula for the
reaction force in the nodes of the rigid constraint.

``covariant quantum mechanics'' on a curved spacetime with absolute time.
  The basic idea is to consider the multi-configuration space, i.e. the
configuration space for $n$ particles, as the $n$-fold product of the
configuration space for one particle. Then we impose a rigid constraint on the
multi-configuration space. The resulting space is then dealt with as a
configuration space of a single abstract `particle'. The same idea is applied
to all geometric and dynamical structures.
  We show that the above configuration space fits into the general framework of
``covariant quantum mechanics''. Hence, the methods of this theory can be
applied to the rigid body.
  Accordingly, we find exactly two inequivalent choices of quantum structures
for the rigid body. Then, we evaluate the quantum energy and momentum operators
and the `rotational part' of their spectra. We provide a new mathematical
interpretation of two-valued wavefunctions on SO(3) in terms of single-valued
sections of a new non-trivial quantum bundle. These results have clear
analogies with spin.

can be developed within the framework of the quantum stochastic calculus of
Hudson-Parthasarathy. The addition of real-time feedback control has been
discussed by many authors, but the foundations of the theory still appear to be
relatively undeveloped. Here we introduce the notion of a controlled quantum
flow, where feedback is taken into account by allowing the coefficients of the
quantum stochastic differential equation to be adapted processes in the
observation algebra. We then prove a separation theorem for quantum control:
the admissible control that minimizes a given cost function is a memoryless
function of the filter, provided that the associated Bellman equation has a
sufficiently regular solution. Along the way we obtain results on existence and
uniqueness of the solutions of controlled quantum filtering equations and on
the innovations problem in the quantum setting.

of Christian Schulze et al and of Viviane de Oliveira et al which allow the
simulation of a large number of languages, similar to today's 8,000 human
languages. The first model deals with a continuous process of random mutations
of a language, transfer from and to other languages, and flight away from
languages spoken by only a few people. The second model combines these flight
and mutation aspects, ignores transfer and describes the colonization of a
large geographical region by people starting at one lattice point. The size of
a language is defined by the number of people speaking it. The first model
gives a realistic log-normal shape for the histogram of language sizes but the
