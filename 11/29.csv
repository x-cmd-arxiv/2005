experiments to measure the power spectrum of large scale structure using
quadratic estimators of the weak lensing deflection field. We calculate the
sensitivity of upcoming CMB experiments such as BICEP, QUaD, BRAIN, ClOVER and
PLANCK to the non-zero total neutrino mass M_nu indicated by current neutrino
oscillation data. We find that these experiments greatly benefit from lensing
extraction techniques, improving their one-sigma sensitivity to M_nu by a
factor of order four. The combination of data from PLANCK and the SAMPAN
mini-satellite project would lead to sigma(M_nu) = 0.1 eV, while a value as
small as sigma(M_nu) = 0.035 eV is within the reach of a space mission based on
bolometers with a passively cooled 3-4 m aperture telescope, representative of
the most ambitious projects currently under investigation. We show that our
results are robust not only considering possible difficulties in subtracting
astrophysical foregrounds from the primary CMB signal but also when the minimal
cosmological model (Lambda Mixed Dark Matter) is generalized in order to
include a possible scalar tilt running, a constant equation of state parameter
for the dark energy and/or extra relativistic degrees of freedom.

and observed X-ray luminosity and temperature of galaxy clusters and groups in
the local Universe. Specifically, we compare recent observations with analytic
models of the intracluster medium in which the gas entropy distribution has
been shifted by a variable amount, K0, to investigate the origin of the scatter
in these scaling relations, and its influence on the luminosity and temperature
functions. We find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch
(which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) are
insufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation.
Instead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately
50 keV sq.cm to 700 keV sq.cm, is required to match the data. This range is
likely related to the variance in heating and/or cooling efficiency from halo
to halo. We demonstrate that these models are consistent with the observed
temperature and luminosity functions of clusters, if scatter in the
mass-luminosity relation is accounted for. Finally, we present predictions for
the redshift evolution of these scaling relations and luminosity/temperature
functions. Comparison with recent data at z<0.7 shows reasonable agreement with
a model that assumes a median entropy floor of K0=200 keV sq.cm. When
observations are extended to group scales (kT < 1 keV), this evolution will
have the potential to discriminate between an entropy floor that is independent
of redshift (for example, in a preheating scenario) and one that depends on the
cooling time of the halo.

with environment, as well as of how correlations between galaxy properties are
affected by environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is
developed, which incorporates the effects which arise from the facts that
typical galaxy marks (e.g., luminosity, color, star formation rate, stellar
mass) depend on the mass of the parent halo, and that massive haloes extend to
larger radii and populate denser regions. Comparison with measured marked
statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good agreement on
scales smaller than a Megaparsec, and excellent agreement on larger scales. The
halo-model description shows clearly that the behaviour of some low-order
marked statistics on these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy
mark as a function of halo mass, but is insensitive to mark-gradients within
haloes. Higher-order statistics encode information about higher order moments
of the distribution of marks within haloes. This information is obtained
without ever having to identify haloes or clusters in the galaxy distribution.
On scales smaller than a Megaparsec, the halo-model calculation shows that
marked statistics allow sensitive tests of whether or not central galaxies in
haloes are a special population. A prescription for including more general
mark-gradients in the halo-model description is also provided. The formalism
developed here is particularly well-suited to interpretation of marked
statistics in astrophysical datasets, because it is phrased in the same
language that is currently used to interpret more standard measures of galaxy
clustering.

quantifying how galaxies are clustered. The statistic uses the positions of
galaxies, but not their properties. Clustering as a function of galaxy
property, be it type, luminosity, color, etc., is usually studied by analysing
a subset of the full population, the galaxies in the subset chosen because they
have a similar range of properties. We explore an alternative
technique---marked correlations---in which one weights galaxies by some
property or `mark' when measuring clustering statistics. Marked correlations
are particularly well-suited to quantifying how the properties of galaxies
correlate with their environment. Therefore, measurements of marked statistics,
with luminosity, stellar mass, color, star-formation rate, etc. as the mark,
permit sensitive tests of galaxy formation models. We make measurements of such
marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models to illustrate their
utility. These measurements show that close pairs of galaxies are expected to
be red, to have larger stellar masses, and to have smaller star formation
rates. We also show that the simplest unbiased estimator of the particular
marked statistic we use extensively is very simple to measure---it does not
require construction of a random catalog---and provide an estimate of its
variance. Large wide-field surveys of the sky are revolutionizing our view of
galaxies and how they evolve. Our results indicate that application of marked

dissipation. The latter is realised by radiative cooling and inelastic
cloud-cloud collisions. We present new schemes for SF and stellar feedback.
They include a consistent calculation of the star formation efficiency (SFE)
based on ISM properties as well as a detailed redistribution of the feedback
energy into the different ISM phases. As a first test example we show a model
of the evolution of a present day Milky-Way-type galaxy. Though the model
exhibits a quasi-stationary behaviour in global properties like mass fractions
or surface densities, the evolution of the ISM is locally strongly variable
depending on the local SF and stellar feedback. We start only with two distinct
phases, but a three-phase ISM is formed soon consisting of cold molecular
clouds, a warm gas disk and a hot gaseous halo. Hot gas is also found in
bubbles in the disk accompanied by type II supernovae explosions. The star
formation rate (SFR) is ~1.6 M_sun/year on average decreasing slowly with time
due to gas consumption. In order to maintain a constant SFR gas replenishment,
e.g. by infall, of the order 1 M_sun/year is required. Our model is in fair
agreement with Kennicutt's (1998) SF law including the cut-off at ~10
M_sun/pc^2. Models with a constant SFE, i.e. no feedback on the SF, fail to

all models. Larger values of $\sigma_{8,0}$, i.e., earlier cluster formation
time, produce lower ellipticities. The dependence of ellipticity on $\Omega_m$
is relatively weak in the range $0.2 \leq \Omega_m \leq 0.5$ for high mass
clusters. The mean ellipticity $\bar{e}(z)$ decreases linearly with the
amplitude of fluctuations at the cluster redshift $z$, nearly independent of
$\Omega_m$; on average, older clusters are more relaxed and are thus less
elliptical. The distribution of ellipticities about the mean is approximated by
a Gaussian, allowing a simple characterization of the evolution of ellipticity
with redshift as a function of cosmological parameters. At $z=0$, the mean
ellipticity of high mass clusters is approximated by $\bar{e}(z=0) =
0.248-0.069 \sigma_{8,0} + 0.013 \Omega_{m,0}$. This relation opens up the
possibility that, when compared with future observations of large cluster

degeneracies between the best solutions for the elements arise for changes in
the relative CNONe abundances and their effects are quantified. We obtain

with the abundance inferred from the 3D hydro models. Changes in the Ne

constructed with low oxygen and high neon are inconsistent with the solar sound

cluster would sink toward the center of the galaxy, and at the same time stars
are stripped out of the cluster by the tidal field of the parent galaxy. We
investigated the orbital evolution of the IMBH, after its parent cluster is
completely disrupted by the tidal field of the parent galaxy, by means of
large-scale N-body simulations. We constructed a model of the central region of
our galaxy, with an SMBH (supermassive black hole) and Bahcall-Wolf stellar
cusp, and placed an IMBH in a circular orbit of radius 0.086pc. The IMBH sinks
toward the SMBH through dynamical friction, but dynamical friction becomes
ineffective when the IMBH reached the radius inside which the initial stellar
mass is comparable to the IMBH mass. This is because the IMBH kicks out the
stars. This behavior is essentially the same as the loss-cone depletion
observed in simulations of massive SMBH binaries. After the evolution through
dynamical friction stalled, the eccentricity of the orbit of the IMBH goes up,
resulting in the strong reduction in the merging timescale through
gravitational wave radiation. Our result indicates that the IMBHs formed close
to the galactic center can merge with the central SMBH in short time. The
number of merging events detectable with DECIGO is estimated to be around 50
per year. Event rate for LISA would be similar or less, depending on the growth

employed the fact that all clusters lie at the same distance and were observed
with the same instrumental setting to derive their properties in a consistent
way, being affected by the same instrumental and observational biases. We
extracted the clusters' K Luminosity Functions (KLF) and developed a simple
method to correct them for extinction, based on colour-magnitude diagrams. The
reliability of the method has been tested by constructing synthetic clusters
from theoretical tracks for pre-main sequence stars and a standard Initial Mass
Function (IMF). The clusters' IMFs have been derived from the dereddened KLFs
by adopting a set of pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks and assuming coeval
star formation. All clusters are small (~100 members) and compact (radius
\~0.1-0.2 pc); their most massive stars are intermediate-mass (~2-10 Msun)
ones. The dereddened KLFs are likely to arise from the same distribution,
suggesting that the selected clusters have quite similar IMFs and star
formation histories. The IMFs are consistent with those derived for field stars
and clusters. Adding them together we found that the ``global'' IMF appears
steeper at the high-mass end and exhibits a drop-off at ~10 Msun. In fact, a
standard IMF would predict a star with M>22.5 Msun within one of the clusters,

formed, or the IMF of the single clusters is steeper at the high-mass end

they are enhanced with respect to simple junctions, in qualitative agreement
with recent experimental studies performed on similar systems. By using a 2D

magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has aroused enormous interest and has
developed into a vigorous field of research. The large tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR) observed in MTJs garnered much attention due to
possible application in random access memories and magnetic field sensors. This
led to a number of fundamental questions regarding the phenomenon of SDT. One
such question is the role of interfaces in MTJs and their effect on the spin
polarization of the tunneling current and TMR. In this paper we consider
different models which suggest that the spin polarization is primarily
determined by the electronic and atomic structure of the ferromagnet/insulator
interfaces rather than by their bulk properties. First, we consider a simple
tight-binding model which demonstrates that the existence of interface states
and their contribution to the tunneling current depend on the degree of
hybridization between the orbitals on metal and insulator atoms. The decisive
role of the interfaces is further supported by studies of spin-dependent
tunneling within realistic first-principles models of Co/vacuum/Al,
Co/Al2O3/Co, Fe/MgO/Fe, and Co/SrTiO3/Co MTJs. We find that variations in the
atomic potentials and bonding strength near the interfaces have a profound
effect resulting in the formation of interface resonant states, which
dramatically affect the spin polarization and TMR. The strong sensitivity of
the tunneling spin polarization and TMR to the interface atomic and electronic
structure dramatically expands the possibilities for engineering optimal MTJ
properties for device applications.

reduces the scattering. The loss of metallicity continues progressively even
into the fully polarized state, and entails as much as a 25% reduction in
average mean-free path. We attribute the observed effect to a deepening of the
potential wells presented by the randomly distributed Co atoms to the majority
spin carriers. This mechanism inverts the sequence of steps for dealing with
disorder and interactions from that in the classic Al'tshuler Aronov approach -
where disorder amplifies the Coulomb interaction between carriers - in that
here, the Coulomb interaction leads to spin polarization which in turn
amplifies the disorder-induced scattering.

around the step is also shown to have a significant effect on the shift of the

dispersive transport of electrons. The latter is usually characterized by the
power $alpha$ of the transient current observed in the time-of-flight

distance dependence. In this paper, we formulate ways to calculate reaction
rates and survival probabilities in the case carriers execute dispersive
diffusion with long-range reactivity. The method is applied to obtain tunneling
recombination rates under dispersive diffusion. The theoretical condition of
observing the relation $delta = alpha/2 + 1$ is obtained and theoretical
recombination rates are compared to the kinetics of observed photoluminescence
decay in the whole time range measured.

There is currently widespread interest in using industrially relevant
semiconductors in new types of spintronic devices based on the manipulation of
spins injected into a semiconducting channel between a spin-polarized source
and drain. However, the transformation of spin information into large
electrical signals is limited by spin relaxation such that the magnetoresistive
signals are below 1%. We overcome this long standing problem in spintronics by
demonstrating large magnetoresistance effects of 61% at 5 K in devices where
the non-magnetic channel is a multiwall carbon nanotube that spans a 1.5 micron
gap between epitaxial electrodes of the highly spin polarized manganite
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. This improvement arises because the spin lifetime in nanotubes
is long due the small spin-orbit coupling of carbon, because the high nanotube
Fermi velocity permits the carrier dwell time to not significantly exceed this
spin lifetime, because the manganite remains highly spin polarized up to the
manganite-nanotube interface, and because the interfacial barrier is of an
appropriate height. We support these latter statements regarding the interface
using density functional theory calculations. The success of our experiments
with such chemically and geometrically different materials should inspire
adventure in materials selection for some future spintronics

reversals, one of them is similar to the phase reversal occurs very often in

are approximated by distinct parameterizations of the {\it same} spacetime. In
this model the evolution from decelerated to accelerated expansion can be
interpreted as a ""first-order"" phase transition between two successive stages.
The dominant energy condition allows different parts of the universe to evolve,
from deceleration to acceleration, at different redshifts within a narrow era.
This picture corresponds to the creation of bubbles of new phase, in the middle
of the old one, typical of first-order phase transitions. Taking $\Omega_{m} =
0.3$ today, we find that the cross-over from deceleration to acceleration
occurs at $z \sim 1-1.5 $, regardless of the equation of state in the very

the deceleration parameter ""jumps"" from $q \sim + 1.5$ to $q \sim - 0.4$ at $z

provides the standard theoretical response to the problem of collinear and

successfully applied to systems with final state degeneracies such as LEP
processes. If there are massless particles in both the initial and final

of disconnected diagrams which produce connected interference effects at the
level of the cross-section. However, this aspect of the theory has never been

become available for study, in addition to their b -> s counterparts that have
proven an indespensable tool for the exploration of new-physics effects in
flavour physics. A prominent example of the b -> d penguin transitions is $\bar
B^0_d \to K^0 \bar K^0$. We show that this decay can be charaterized in the
Standard Model by a surface in the observable space of the direct and
mixing-induced CP asymmetries and the branching ratio. The form of this
surface, which is theoretically clean, implies a lower bound for the branching
ratio that has recently been confirmed experimentally. If future measurements
of the CP asymmetries yield a point away from the SM surface, this would be an
interesting signal of new physics. We point out that the hadronic parameters in
$\bar B^0_d \to K^0 \bar K^0$ that parameterize the position on the SM surface
are related to hadronic parameters in the B -> pi K system. The fact that the
branching ratio of $\bar B^0_d \to K^0 \bar K^0$ is very close to its lower
bound yields interesting implications for B -> pi K even without knowledge of
the CP asymmetries of $\bar B^0_d \to K^0 \bar K^0$. The mechanism that
produces the lower bound for $\bar B^0_d \to K^0 \bar K^0$ is actually much
more general; we derive lower bounds for various other b -> d penguin-induced

Some of these theoretical lower bounds are very close to the current

smaller string constant alpha' and thus, a higher tension). T_s is the precise
quantum dual of the semiclassical (QFT Hawking-Gibbons) de Sitter temperature
T_sem = hbar c /(2\pi k_B L). We find a new formula for the full de Sitter
entropy S_sem (H), as a function of the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
S_sem^(0)(H). For L << l_{Planck}, ie. for low H << c/l_Planck,
S_{sem}^{(0)}(H) is the leading term, but for high H near c/l_Planck, a new
phase transition operates and the whole entropy S_sem (H) is drastically
different from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_sem^(0)(H). We compute the
string quantum emission cross section by a black hole in de Sitter (or
asymptotically de Sitter) space-time (bhdS). For T_sem ~ bhdS << T_s, (early
evaporation stage), it shows the QFT Hawking emission with temperature T_sem ~
bhdS, (semiclassical regime). For T_sem ~ bhdS near T_{s}, it exhibits a phase
transition into a string de Sitter state of size L_s = l_s^2/L}, l_s=
\sqrt{\hbar alpha'/c), and string de Sitter temperature T_s. Instead of
featuring a single pole singularity in the temperature (Carlitz transition), it
features a square root branch point (de Vega-Sanchez transition). New bounds on
the black hole radius r_g emerge in the bhdS string regime: it can become r_g =
L_s/2, or it can reach a more quantum value, r_g = 0.365 l_s.

state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the
system together with a model for the system's time evolution. Rather than
solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available,
one uses the model to ``forecast'' the current state, using a prior state
estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial
condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current
state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty
in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time,
are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for
data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a
type of ``ensemble Kalman filter'', in which the state estimate and its
approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of
system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its
implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed
rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble
Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the
efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric
data with the global forecast model used by the U.S. National Weather Service.

that the entire computational domain can be divided in two regions, with the FD

demonstrate the feasibility of the method on the Poiseuille flow, where the LB

the geometry of the flow, one technique can be more efficient, less memory

near the boundaries), whereas the converse is true for other parts of the same
system. We can also imagine that a given system solved, say by FD, can be
augmented in some spatial regions with a new physical process that is better
treated by a LB model. Our approach allows us to only modify the concerned
region without altering the rest of the computation.

gained through the distillation of a secret key. An analogue of `quantum state

two-stage scheme based on Sum Frequency Generation, using a Periodically Poled
Lithium Niobate (PPLN) nonlinear crystal and a Silicon Avalanche Photodiode. An
experimental investigation shows that, in addition to a high timing resolution,
this technique yields a detection sensitivity of 1.24 pW with 63mW of net pump
power.
