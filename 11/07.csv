detecting galaxy clusters throughout our Hubble volume through their
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signature, down to a given limiting flux. The number
density of galaxy clusters is highly sensitive to cluster mass through
fluctuations in the matter power spectrum, as well as redshift through the
comoving volume and the growth factor. This sensitivity in principle allows
tight constraints on such quantities as the equation of state of dark energy
and the neutrino mass. We evaluate the ability of future cluster surveys to
measure these quantities simultaneously when combined with PLANCK-like CMB
data. Using a simple effective model for uncertainties in the cluster mass-SZ
flux relation, we evaluate systematic shifts in cosmological constraints from
cluster SZ surveys. We find that a systematic bias of 10% in cluster mass
measurements can give rise to shifts in cosmological parameter estimates at
levels larger than the $1\sigma$ statistical errors. Systematic errors are
unlikely to be detected from the mass and redshift dependence of cluster number
counts alone; increasing survey size has only a marginal effect. Implications
for upcoming experiments are discussed.

this general EOS, a completely integrable dynamical equation to the scale

explain the late-time accelerating expansion universe in a new view. The early

halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that are
satellites. Here we present observational constraints from the SDSS on these
quantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass using
galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351,507 lenses. We use stellar
masses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak
gravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the
halo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an L*
galaxy with a stellar mass of 6x10^{10} M_{sun} is hosted by a halo with mass
of 1.4x10^{12} M_{sun}/h, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversion
efficiencies of 17_{-5}^{+10} (early types) and 16_{-6}^{+15} (late types) per
cent at the 95 per cent CL (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty
due to assumption of a universal initial mass function, or IMF). We find that
for a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below
M_{stellar}=10^{11} M_{sun}, in contrast to typically a factor of two
difference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity.
This suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range and
should be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed.
For higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of
stellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early and late types
become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster halos with
masses above 10^{13} M_{sun} host ellipticals at the center, while even the
brightest central spirals are hosted by halos of mass below 10^{13} M_{sun}.

region, and the swept-up shell, solving the UV- and FUV-radiative transfer, the
thermal and chemical processes in the time-dependent hydrodynamics code.
Following our previous paper, we investigate the time evolutions with various
ambient number densities and central stars. Our calculations show that basic
evolution is qualitatively similar among our models with different parameters.
The molecular gas is finally accumulated in the shell, and the gravitational
fragmentation of the shell is generally expected. The quantitative differences
among models are well understood with analytic scaling relations. The detailed
physical and chemical structure of the shell is mainly determined by the
incident FUV flux and the column density of the shell, which also follow the
scaling relations. The time of shell-fragmentation, and the mass of the
gathered molecular gas are sensitive tothe ambient number density. In the case
of the lower number density, the shell-fragmentation occurs over a longer
timescale, and the accumulated molecular gas is more massive. The variations
with different central stars are more moderate. The time of the
shell-fragmentation differs by a factor of several with the various stars of
M_* = 12-101 M_sun. According to our numerical results, we conclude that the
expanding HII region should be an efficient trigger for star formation in
molecular clouds if the mass of the ambient molecular material is large enough.

as well as geometrical role of the Ricci scalar curvature) in a natural way
without any input in the theory for it. In contrast to other models, where an
idea for dark energy is introduced in the beginning of the theory, here it
emerges from the gravitational sector spontaneously.Dark energy density,
obtained in this model,decreases with scale factor $a(t)$ as $\sim a(t)^{- 3 (1

{\rm GeV}^4$ at Planck scale to its present value suggested by recent
experiments. Interestingly, apart from dark energy, dark radiation and dark
matter are also obtained from gravity sector.Moreover, time for transition from
deceleration to acceleration is evaluated. It is found that if dark energy
obeys equation of state for generalized Chaplygin gas and barotropic fluid
simultaneously, evolution of scale factor depends on $cosh (t - t_*)$ ($t$ and
$t_*$ being time and transition time respectively), but after a finite time
expansion will become de-Sitter like.

effective temperature plays a critical role for the X-ray activity in brown
dwarfs. This underlines an earlier suggestion based on observations of
chromospheric Ha emission in ultracool dwarfs that the low ionization fraction
in the cool brown dwarf atmospheres may suppress magnetic activity.

of the gravitation energy is transformed into the energy of the explosion,
observed in SN II, SN Ib,c type supernovae. The mechanism of transformation is
not simple, because the overwhelming majority of the energy is going into
weakly interacting neutrino. The attempts to use this energy for the explosion
were not successful during about 40 years of investigation. We consider the
explosion mechanism in which the source of energy is the rotation, and magnetic
field serves for the transformation of the rotation energy into the energy of
explosion. 2-D MHD simulations of this mechanism were performed. After the
collapse the core consists of a rapidly rotating proto-neutron star with a
differentially rotating envelope. The toroidal part of the magnetic energy
generated by the differential rotation grows as quadratic function with time at
the initial stage of the evolution of the magnetic field. The linear growth of
the toroidal magnetic field is terminated by the development of
magnetohydrodynamic instability, when the twisted toroidal component strongly
exceeds the poloidal field, leading to a drastic acceleration in the growth of
magnetic energy. At the moment when the magnetic pressure becomes comparable to
the gas pressure at the periphery of the proto-neutron star the MHD compression
wave appears and goes through the envelope of the collapsed core. It transforms
into the fast MHD shock and produces a supernova explosion. Our simulations
give the energy of the explosion $0.6\cdot 10^{51}$ ergs. The amount of the
mass ejected by the explosion is $\sim 0.14M_\odot$. The implicit numerical
method, based on the Lagrangian triangular grid of variable structure, was used

Extending our previous consideration (Gusakov et al. 2004a), we include the
effects of accreted envelopes of light elements. We employ phenomenological
density-dependent critical temperatures T_{cp}(\rho) and T_{cnt}(\rho) of
singlet-state proton and triplet-state neutron pairing in a stellar core, as
well as the critical temperature T_{cns}(\rho) of singlet-state neutron pairing
in a stellar crust. We show that the presence of accreted envelopes simplifies
the interpretation of observations of thermal radiation from isolated neutron
stars in the scenario of Gusakov et al. (2004a) and widens the class of models
for nucleon superfluidity in neutron star interiors consistent with the

types of channel degradations rank deficiency and spatial fading correlation of

diversity performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, with an
emphasis on orthogonal space-time block codes, in terms of the symbol error
probability, the effective fading figure (EFF), and the capacity at low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In particular, we consider a general family of
MIMO channels known as double-scattering channels, which encompasses a variety
of propagation environments from independent and identically distributed
Rayleigh to degenerate keyhole or pinhole cases by embracing both
rank-deficient and spatial correlation effects. It is shown that a MIMO system

$\frac{\n_T n_S n_R}{\max(n_T,n_S,n_R)}$ in a double-scattering channel with

example, at the polarized neutrino scattering in the field of a spinless

Pauli form factors of each lepton and its neutrino. A new left-right
antisymmetric theory of force unification based on a gauge group $SU(2)_{L}$

conservation of charge, lepton flavors and full lepton number. Therefore, each

Examples are a model of crystalline solid as a lattice of coupled oscillators

Helmholtz resonator as a subsystem of a larger conservative oscillatory system.
Taking the view of an observer accessing only the open subsystem we ask, in
particular, what information about the entire system can be reconstructed

of an open subsystem, we construct a canonical decomposition of the
conservative system describing, in particular, its parts coupled to and
completely decoupled from the open subsystem. The coupled one together with the

of ratios of random characteristic polynomials are studied. Basic to our
treatment is a property shared by the spinor representation of the spin group
with the Shale-Weil representation of the metaplectic group: in both cases the
character is the analytic square root of a determinant or the reciprocal
thereof. By combining this fact with Howe's theory of supersymmetric dual pairs
(g,K), we express the K-Haar average product of p ratios of characteristic
polynomials and q conjugate ratios as a character which is associated with an
irreducible representation of the Lie superalgebra g = gl(n|n) for n = p+q.
This primitive character is shown to extend to an analytic radial section of a
real supermanifold related to gl(n|n), and is computed by invoking Berezin's
description of the radial parts of Laplace-Casimir operators for gl(n|n). The
final result for the character looks like a natural transcription of the Weyl
character formula to the context of highest-weight representations of Lie
supergroups.

range where N is no less than max(p,q), the present approach covers the full
range of matrix dimensions N.

  If $R$ is some (analytic) equivalence relation on a Polish space $X$, it is

conjectured that any separable Banach space such that isomorphism between its

  - the relation $\sim^{perm}$ of permutative equivalence between normalized
basic sequences is analytic non Borel,
  - if $X$ is a Banach space with a Schauder basis $(e_n)$, such that
$\sim^{perm}$ between normalized block-sequences of $X$ is classifiable, then

structure. To better understand these examples, we catalog the ramification
filtrations that are possible in totally ramified extensions of dyadic number
fields. Interestingly, we find that the catalog depends, for sharp lower
bounds, upon the refined ramification filtration, which is associated with the
biquatratic subfield. Moreover these examples, as counter-examples to the
conclusion of Hasse-Arf, occur only when the refined filtration is, in two
different ways, extreme.

measurements of spin or polarization on multi-particle systems in singlet

relation. Theoretically, the non-commuting nature should be independent of
whether the singlet state consists of multiple particles or a single particle.
Recent experiments in single neutron interferometry have in fact demonstrated
this. In addition, if Bell-type inequalities can be found for experiments
involving spin and polarization, the same should be true for experiments
involving other non-commuting observables such as position and momentum as in
the original EPR paper. As such, an experiment is proposed to measure (quantum
mechanically) position and momentum for a single oscillator as a means for
deriving a Bell-type inequality for these correlated observables. The
experiment, if realizable, would shed light on the basic nature of matter,
perhaps pointing to some form of self-entanglement, and would also help to
further elucidate a possible mechanism behind the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. Violation of these inequalities would, in fact, offer yet another

strongly increased when the potential barrier varies in the direction
perpendicular to the line connecting the two wells and remains constant along
this line. An oscillatory structure of the wave function is formed in the
direction joining the wells. The resulting motion can be coherent like motion
in a conventional narrow band periodic structure. A particle penetrates the
barrier over a long distance which strongly contrasts to WKB-like tunneling.
The whole problem is stationary. A not very small tunneling transparency can be
set between two quantum wires with real physical parameters and separated by a
long potential barrier. The phenomenon is connected to Euclidean resonance.

ensembles of single photons. Our setup is based on a measurement method known
to be optimal for estimating the state of two level systems. The setup has no
moving parts and is sensitive to weak sources (emitting single photons) of
light as it relies on photon counting and has potential applications in both
classical polarization measurements and quantum communication scenarios. In our
implementation, we are able to reconstruct the Stokes parameters of pure
polarization states with an average fidelity of 99.9%.

powers $G^n$ of a fixed group $G$. Under a condition on the base group $G$, we
prove that strong Fourier sampling cannot distinguish some subgroups of $G^n$.
Since strong sampling is in fact the optimal measurement on a coset state, this
shows that we have no hope of efficiently solving the hidden subgroup problem
over these groups with separable measurements on coset states (that is, using
any polynomial number of single-register coset state experiments). Base groups
satisfying our condition include all nonabelian simple groups. We apply our
results to show that there exist uniform families of nilpotent groups whose
normal series factors have constant size and yet are immune to strong Fourier
sampling.

view, i.e., the viewpoint that thetheory has to do with what can be said about
nature. This gives a relationship to statistical reasoning and to other areas
of modelling and decision making. In particular, a quantum state can be defined
from an epistemic point of view to consist of two elements: A (maximal)
question about the value of some parameter together with the answer to that
question. Quantization itself can be approached from the point of view of model
reduction under symmetry.

space) when they are immersed in a background of non-interacting fermionic
matter fields. The interaction follows from the obstructions to the (quantum
mechanical) motions of the fermions caused by the presence of bubbles or other
(heavy) particles in the Fermi sea, as, for example, nuclei in the neutron sea
in the inner crust of a neutron star or superfluid grains in a normal Fermi
liquid. The effect resembles the traditional Casimir interaction between
metallic mirrors in the vacuum. However, the fluctuating electromagnetic fields
are replaced by fermionic matter fields. We show that the fermionic Casimir
problem for a system of spherical cavities can be solved exactly, since the
calculation can be mapped onto a quantum mechanical billiard problem of a
point-particle scattered off a finite number of non-overlapping spheres or
disks. Finally we generalize the map method to other Casimir systems,
especially to the case of a fluctuating scalar field between two spheres or a
sphere and a plate under Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Gen. 39 (2006) 5135-5150","10.1088/0305-4470/39/18/026",,"quant-ph",,"  Probabilistic cloning was first proposed by Duan and Guo. Then Pati
established a novel cloning machine (NCM) for copying superposition of multiple
clones simultaneously. In this paper, we deal with the novel cloning machine
with supplementary information (NCMSI). For the case of cloning two states, we
demonstrate that the optimal efficiency of the NCMSI in which the original
party and the supplementary party can perform quantum communication equals that
achieved by a two-step cloning protocol wherein classical communication is only
allowed between the original and the supplementary parties. From this
equivalence it follows that NCMSI may increase the success probabilities for
copying. Also, an upper bound on the unambiguous discrimination of two
nonorthogonal pure product states is derived. Our investigation generalizes and
completes the results in the literature.
