in the simplest curvaton model proposed in our paper astro-ph/9610219. The
amplitude of metric perturbations in this model takes different values in
different parts of the universe. The spatial distribution of the amplitude
looks like a web consisting of exponentially large cells. Depending on the
relation between the cell size l_0 and the scale of the horizon l_H, one may
either live in a part of the universe dominated by gaussian perturbations
(inside a cell with l_0 >> l_H), or in the universe dominated by nongaussian
perturbations (for l_0 << l_H). We show that the curvaton contribution to the
total amplitude of adiabatic density perturbations can be strongly suppressed
if the energy density of the universe prior to the curvaton decay was dominated
not by the classical curvaton field but by the curvaton particles produced
during reheating. We describe the curvaton-inflaton transmutation effect: The
same field in different parts of the universe may play either the role of the
curvaton or the role of the inflaton. Finally, we discuss an interplay between
the curvaton web and anthropic considerations in the string theory landscape.

galaxies are explored using principal component analysis (PCA), focusing on
differences between elliptical galaxies in Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) and in
the field. The method is model-independent and relies on variations between the
observed spectra. The projections (PC1,PC2) reveal a difference with respect to
environment, with a wider range in PC1 and PC2 in the group sample. We define a
spectral parameter (zeta=0.36PC1-PC2) which simplifies this result to a single
number: field galaxies have a very similar value of zeta, whereas HCG galaxies
span a wide range in this parameter. We obtain a strong correlation between the
values of zeta and the mass fraction in younger stars, so that some group
galaxies present a higher fraction of them. PCA is more sensitive than other
methods based on a direct analysis of observables such as the structure of the
surface brightness profile or the equivalent width of absorption lines. The
latter do not reveal any significant variation between field and compact group
galaxies. Our results imply that the presence of young stars only amounts to a
fraction of a percent in its contribution to the total variance.

generalise the analytical results obtained in the deep-MOND limit by Zhao

framework of a MOND-like gravity modification function mu(g) or a general
non-Keplerian gravity g \propto R^-\zeta. We give analytical expressions for
the inner Lagrange point and Robe lobe axis ratios. The Roche lobe volume is
proven to scale linearly with the true mass ratio, which applies to any mu(g),
hence mass-tracing light models would overpredict the Roche lobe of a DM-poor
globular cluster in a DM-rich host galaxy, and underpredict the size of a
DM-richer dwarf satellite. The lobes are squashed with the flattening ~ 0.4 in
the strong gravity and ~ 0.6 in the weak gravity; a precise measurement of the

analysed to estimate the contributions of both macroturbulence and rotation to
the broadening of their metal lines. Two different methodologies are
considered, viz. goodness-of-fit comparisons between observed and theoretical
line profiles and identifying zeros in the Fourier transforms of the observed
profiles. The advantages and limitations of the two methods are briefly
discussed with the latter techniques being adopted for estimated projected
rotational velocities (\vsini) but the former being used to estimate
macroturbulent velocities. Only one SMC supergiant, SK 191, shows a significant
degree of rotational broadening (\vsini $\simeq$ 90 \kms). For the remaining
targets, the distribution of projected rotational velocities are similar in
both our Galactic and SMC samples with larger values being found at earlier
spectral types. There is marginal evidence for the projected rotational
velocities in the SMC being higher than those in the Galactic targets but any
differences are only of the order of 5-10 \kms, whilst evolutionary models
predict differences in this effective temperature range of typically 20 to 70
\kms. The combined sample is consistent with a linear variation of projected
rotational velocity with effective temperature, which would imply rotational
velocities for supergiants of 70 \kms at an effective temperature of 28 000 K
(approximately B0 spectral type) decreasing to 32 \kms at 12 000 K (B8 spectral
type). For all targets, the macroturbulent broadening would appear to be
consistent with a Gaussian distribution (although other distributions cannot be
discounted) with an $\frac{1}{e}$ half-width varying from approximately 20 \kms
at B8 to 60 \kms at B0 spectral types.

spheroidals (dSphs): tidal stripping and tidal shocking. Using N-body
simulations, we show that tidal stripping always leads to flat or rising
projected velocity dispersions beyond a critical radius; it is $\sim 5$ times
more likely, when averaging over all possible projection angles, that the
cylindrically averaged projected dispersion will rise, rather than be flat. In
contrast, the Local Group dSphs, as a class, show flat or falling projected
velocity dispersions interior to $\sim 1$ kpc. This argues for tidal stripping
being unimportant interior to $\sim 1$ kpc for most of the Local Group dSphs
observed so far.
  These results have important implications for the formation of the dSphs and
for cosmology. A tidal origin for the formation of these Local Group dSphs (in
which they contain no dark matter) is strongly disfavoured. In the cosmological
context, a naive solution to the missing satellites problem is to allow only
the most massive substructure dark matter halos around the Milky Way to form
stars. It is possible for dSphs to reside within these halos ($\sim
10^{10}$M$_\odot$) and have their velocity dispersions lowered through the
action of tidal shocks, but only if they have a central density core in their
dark matter, rather than a cusp. dSphs can reside within cuspy dark matter
halos if their halos are less massive ($\sim 10^{9}$M$_\odot$) and therefore
have smaller central velocity dispersions initially (abridged).

angular-momentum losses due to magnetic braking, not otherwise operative with
intermediate-mass companion stars. We suggest that for donor stars possessing
the anomalously high magnetic fields associated with Ap and Bp stars, a
magnetically coupled, irradiation-driven stellar wind can lead to substantial
systemic loss of angular-momentum. In this paper we apply this mechanism to a
specific astrophysics problem involving the formation of compact black-hole
binaries with low-mass donor stars. At present, it is not understood how these
systems form, given that low-mass companion stars are not likely to provide
sufficient gravitational potential to unbind the envelope of the massive
progenitor of the black hole during a prior `common-envelope' phase. However,
in the absence of magnetic braking, such systems tend to evolve to long orbital
periods. We show that, with the proposed magnetic braking properties afforded
by Ap and Bp companions, such a scenario can lead to the formation of compact
black-hole binaries with orbital periods, donor masses, lifetimes, and
production rates that are in accord with the observations. In spite of these
successes, our models reveal a significant discrepancy between the calculated
effective temperatures and the observed spectral types of the donor stars.
Finally, we show that this temperature discrepancy would still exist for other
scenarios invoking initially intermediate-mass donor stars, and this presents a
substantial unresolved mystery.

most clearly for the optimally doped sample and commonly ascribed to the mode

elaborate that the overall decrease of the optical scattering rate originates

of the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application
domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy
controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with
synergistic rules, fulfilling the $\epsilon$-completeness property and
providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed
representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units
that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act
as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be
specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the
rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution.

  The integrated POSIX threads support of NetBSD-2.0 and later allows us to use
library primitives provided for NetBSD's phtread system to implement the
primitives needed by the SR run-time system, thus implementing 13 target CPUs
at once and automatically making use of SMP on VAX, Alpha, PowerPC, Sparc,
32-bit Intel and 64 bit AMD CPUs.
  We'll present some methods used for the impementation and compare some
performance values to the traditional implementation.

neglected before is taken into account in this work. It is found that the
intermediate $K^*$ contribution dominates in the $\Sigma\bar p\gamma$ mode and
is comparable to the baryon pole effect in $\Lambda\bar p\gamma$ and
$\Xi\bar\Lambda\gamma$ modes. The branching ratios for $B^-\to\Lambda\bar

and $6\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The threshold enhancement effect in the
dibaryon mass spectrum is responsible by the meson pole diagram. We also study
the angular distribution of the baryon in the dibaryon rest frame. The baryon
pole diagrams imply that the antibaryon tends to emerge in the direction of the
photon in the baryon-pair rest frame. The predicted angular asymmetry agrees
with experiment for $B^-\to\Lambda\bar p\gamma$. Measurements of the
correlation of the photon with the baryon allow us to discriminate between
different models for describing the radiative baryonic B decays. For decays
$B\to\Xi\bar\Sigma\gamma$, a large correlation of the photon to the
$\bar\Sigma$ and a broad bump in the dibaryon mass spectrum are predicted.

diffeomorphisms on target space. Here we demonstrate that for all these
theories there exists, in fact, a weaker integrability condition which again
defines submodels with infinitely many conservation laws. These conservation
laws will be related to an abelian subgroup of the group of area-preserving
diffeomorphisms. As this weaker integrability condition is much easier to
fulfil, it should be useful in the study of those non-linear field theories.

continuous spectrum (a feature uncommon for periodic elliptic operators of
second order). In all known constructions of such examples, the corresponding
eigenfunction is compactly supported. One wonders whether this must always be
the case. The paper answers this question affirmatively. What is more
surprising, one can estimate that the eigenmode must be localized not far away
from the perturbation (in a neighborhood of the perturbation's support, the
width of the neighborhood determined by the unperturbed operator only).
  The validity of this result requires the condition of irreducibility of the
Fermi (Floquet) surface of the periodic operator, which is expected to be
satisfied for instance for periodic Schroedinger operators.

question: We establish contact non-squeezing on large scales, and show that it
disappears on small scales. The algebraic counterpart of the (non)-squeezing
problem for contact domains is the question of existence of a natural partial

prove that the standard contact sphere is non-orderable while the real
projective space is known to be orderable. Our methods include a new embedding

  The main technical step is to prove a very general result concerning
existence of harmonic maps into infinite dimensional spaces, namely a class of
simply connected, homogeneous, aspherical Hilbert manifolds. This builds on
previous work of Corlette-Zimmer and Korevaar-Schoen. Our result is new because
we consider more general targets than previous authors and make no assumption
concerning the action. In particular, the target space is not assumed to have
non-positive curvature and in important cases has significant positive
curvature. We also do not make a ""reductivity"" assumption concerning absence of
fixed points at infinity.

prove the analog of a conjecture of Rapoport and Zink stating the existence of

statistical model for atoms, with a communication at the general meeting of the
Italian Physical Society, held in Rome, on December 29th, 1928, regularly
published on Nuovo Cimento. This communication did not receive any mention,
neither in the numerous publications of Fermi and his associates on the
subject, nor in the further reconstructions of the life and activity of Ettore
Majorana. The Majorana proposal was not accepted by Enrico Fermi for years, and
forgotten. However, it was finally exploited, without reference, in the 1934
conclusive paper by Fermi and Amaldi on the statistical model for atoms. We
analyze the improved model proposed by Majorana, with the help of unpublished
notes, kept in the Majorana Archives in Pisa. Moreover, we trace the path
leading Fermi to the eventual late acceptance of Majorana improvement, also
with the help of the material in Fermi Archives in Pisa. The conclusion is that
Ettore Majorana played an effective leadership in Rome for the very conceptual
formulation of the statistical model for atoms.

of these planets or by the possible tidal distorsions of their liquid cores. We
will review in this paper some of our experimental works devoted to the
elliptical instability and present some new results when the experimental fluid
is a liquid metal. We show in particular that an imposed magnetic field is
distorted by the spin- over mode generated by the elliptical instability. In
our experiment, the field is weak (20 Gauss) and the Lorenz force is negligible
compared to the inertial forces, therefore the magnetic field does not modify
the fluid flow and the pure hydrodynamics growth rates of the instability are
recovered through magnetic measurements.

phase-shifting telescope-interferometer. What is called a
""Telescope-Interferometer"" (T-I) is indeed a novel, recently proposed Wavefront
Error (WFE) sensing technique, whose basic idea consists in combining the main
pupil of a telescope with a second, off-axis reference arm. Then a weak
modulation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is generated at the focal plane,
allowing for direct phase measurements. We propose a notable improvement of the
method, inspired from classical principles of phase shifting interferometry.
Herein are presented the alternative principle and its achievable measurement
accuracy. The technique shows high performance excepted on narrow areas located
near the pupil boundary. It is applicable to both ground or space telescopes
and is suitable for the co-phasing of segmented mirrors, which is of prime
importance in view of future giant telescope projects.

oneself in the complex and rapidly changing modern worlds of work. This paper
examines the evolution of competence, i.e. the role of competences in an
evolutionary problem-solving process, and the role of flexibility as a
meta-competence from the perspective of the general concept of
Geometrically-Oriented Evolution THEory (G_O_E_THE).
  We use evolutionary search agents as abstract models of real individuals and
groups. In a first approach the agents search for better competence profiles.
In a second approach they use competences to solve problems. A search agent
operates in an abstract value landscape, a fitness landscape. The crucial
difference between the evolutionary search agents and other agent models is the
fact that interaction patterns of the new agents incorporate evolutionary
search strategies.
  A special simulation tool called EVOLINO allows to simulate the hill-climbing
process of search agents in complex landscapes.
