  Universitatis Turkuensis, C. Flynn, ed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) In this celebratory contribution, we present some new data from
standard star cluster modelling containing primordial binaries and triples, as
well as results from a binary black hole simulation with two massive members.
In the star cluster case, the process of mass loss from evolving stars,
together with general mass segregation, promotes favourable interactions
involving compact subsystems of binaries and triples in the central region.
Three-body interactions often lead to energetic ejections, with one or more of
the components attaining relatively large terminal velocities which can be
observed in principle. The second type of stellar system to be discussed is
based on the scenario of two approaching galactic cores with density cusps,
each having a massive black hole. After the subsystems become well mixed, the
two massive components soon form a hard binary which gains energy by ejecting
other members. Such a massive binary has a large cross section and can be very
effective in depleting bound stars from the core. Again high-velocity escapers
are produced, with their terminal speeds related to the shrinking binary size
which eventually leads to coalescence.

Interestingly, more than 50% of these objects have 24 micron flux densities >50

\~100-1000 solar masses per year. As a result, galaxies with stellar masses
>10^11 solar masses have specific SFRs equal to or exceeding the global value
at z~1.5-3. In contrast, galaxies with >10^11 solar masses z~0.3-0.75 have
specific SFRs less than the global average, and more than an order of magnitude
lower than that for massive DRGs at z~1.5-3. Thus, the bulk of star formation
in massive galaxies is largely complete by z~1.5. The red colors and large
inferred stellar masses in the DRGs suggest that much of the star formation in
these galaxies occurred at redshifts z>5-6. Using model star-formation
histories that match the DRG colors and stellar masses at z~2-3, and
measurements of the UV luminosity density at z>5-6, we consider what

extended the usual presumption of a scale invariant spectrum to include: (i) a

interruption of the potential driving inflation; (iii) a large scale cutoff in
power as the first year WMAP results appear to indicate; (iv) a reconstruction
of the spectrum in eight bins in wavenumber; and (v) a spectrum resulting from
a cosmological model proposed by Lasenby & Doran, which naturally exhibits an
exponential drop in power on very large scales. The result of our complete
Bayesian analysis includes not only the posterior probability distribution from
which parameter estimates are inferred but also the Bayesian evidence. This
evidence value is greater for a model with fewer parameters unless a more
complicated model provides a significantly better fit to the data, thus
allowing a powerful method of model selection. We find that those models
exhibiting any form of cutoff in power on large scales consistently produce
higher evidences than either the Harrison-Zel'dovich or single spectral index

close encounters (r <30 kpc/h) can increase the SF activity to levels higher
than that exhibit in galaxies without a close companion. Analysing the internal

their detection efficiency by steering electrons to the anode pixels which
otherwise would drift to the area between pixels. Previously, the benefit of
steering grids had been compromised by additional noise associated with
currents between the steering grids and the anode pixels. We use thin film
deposition techniques to isolate the steering grid from the CZT substrate by a
150 nm thick layer of the isolator Aluminiumoxide. While the thin layer does
not affect the beneficial effect of the steering grid on the weighting

we extrapolate the time dependent fluxes measured by the BAT, in the energy
band 15-350 keV, into the spectral regime observed by the XRT 0.2-10 keV, and
examine the functional form of the rate of decay of the two light curves. We
find that the BAT and XRT light curves merge to form a unified curve. There is
a period of steep decay up to ~300 s, followed by a flatter decay. The duration
of the steep decay, ~100 s in the source frame after correcting for
cosmological time dilation, agrees roughly with a theoretical estimate for the
deceleration time of the relativistic ejecta as it interacts with circumstellar
material. For GRB 050315, the steep decay can be characterized by an
exponential form, where one e-folding decay time t_e(BAT) ~ 24+/-2 s, and
t_e(XRT) ~ 35+/-2 s. For GRB 050319, a power law decay -(d ln f/d ln t) = n,
where n is about 3, provides a reasonable fit. The early time X-ray fluxes are
consistent with representing the lower energy tail of the prompt emission, and
provide our first quantitative measure of the decay of the prompt gamma-ray
emission over a large dynamic range in flux. The initial steep decay is
expected due to the delayed high latitude photons from a curved shell of
relativistic plasma illuminated only for a short interval. The overall
conclusion is that the prompt phase of GRBs remains observable for hundreds of
seconds longer than previously thought.

volume-limited sample, with magnitude limit cutoff M_r = -20.5, containing
about 50 thousand luminous galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2. In addition,
galaxies are classified according to their emission line properties in three
distinct spectral classes: star-forming galaxies, with young stellar
populations; passive galaxies, dominated by old stellar populations; and, hosts
of active nuclei, which comprise a mix of young and old stellar populations. We
show that the extremes of the distribution of some galaxy properties,
essentially galaxy colours, 4000 A break index, and mean stellar ages, are
associated to star-forming galaxies at one side, and passive galaxies at
another. We find that the mean light-weighted stellar age of galaxies is the
direct responsible for the bimodality seen in the galaxy population. The
stellar mass, in this view, has an additional role since most of the
star-forming galaxies present in the local universe are low-mass galaxies. Our
results also give support to the existence of a 'downsizing' in galaxy
formation, where massive galaxies seen nowadays have stellar populations formed

to the present by using IRAC imaging of a sample of early-type galaxies in the
Chandra Deep Field-South at z~1 with accurately measured dynamical masses. We
find that $M/L_K$ evolves as $\Delta\ln{(M/L_K)}=(-1.18\pm0.10)z$, which is
slower than in the B-band ($\Delta\ln{(M/L_B)}=(-1.46\pm0.09)z$). In the B-band
the evolution has been demonstrated to be strongly mass dependent. In the
K-band we find a weaker trend: galaxies more massive than
$M=2\times10^{11}M_{\odot}$ evolve as $\Delta\ln{(M/L_K)}=(-1.01\pm0.16)z$;
less massive galaxies evolve as $\Delta\ln{(M/L_K)}=(-1.27\pm0.11)z$. As
expected from stellar population models the evolution in $M/L_K$ is slower than
the evolution in $M/L_B$. However, when we make a quantitative comparison, we
find that the single burst Bruzual-Charlot models do not fit the results well,
unless large dust opacities are allowed at z=1. Models with a flat IMF fit
better, Maraston models with a different treatment of AGB stars fit best. These
results show that the interpretation of rest-frame near-IR photometry is
severely hampered by model uncertainties and therefore that the determination
of galaxy masses from rest-frame near-IR photometry may be harder than was
thought before.

potential of radio-transient searches is high, as demonstrated recently by the
discovery of a previously unknown type of source which varies on timescales of
minutes to hours. Here we report a new large-scale search for radio sources
varying on much shorter timescales. This has revealed 11 objects characterized
by single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30 ms. The average
time intervals between bursts range from 4 minutes to 3 hours, with radio

arrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4 - 7 s for ten
of the 11 sources, suggesting a rotating neutron star origin. Despite the small
number of sources presently detected, their ephemeral nature implies a total
Galactic population which significantly exceeds that of the regularly pulsing
radio pulsars. Five of the ten sources have periods greater than 4 s, and
period derivatives have been measured for three of the sources, with one having
a very high inferred magnetic field of 5e13 G, suggesting that this new

duration was 0.07 s), we identify two models: i) a high-density solution, where
the ejecta are collimated in a jet of half-angle theta_{jet} > 6 deg and
interact with a medium of particle density 10^{-4}/cc < n < 0.1/cc, and ii) a
low-density solution with theta_{jet} > 2 deg and n < 10^{-5}/cc. These density
ranges are compatible with those expected in the vicinity of the host galaxy
and in the intergalactic medium, lending support to the hypothesis that the
progenitor of GRB 050907 is a NS-NS or NS-BH merger. For GRB 050724 (which last
3 s), we obtain 0.1/cc < n < 1000/cc and theta_{jet} > 8 deg. The range of
allowed densities shows that this burst occurred in the intragalactic
environment. The dynamical parameters of the high-density model for the GRB
afterglow 050709 are similar to those for 050724. If these parameters are
representative for short-GRB outflows, then these jets are less collimated and
have a lower kinetic energy than those of long bursts, which suggests that GRB
jets are not magnetically collimated and are powered by the gravitational
energy of the torus. Evidently, the analysis of more short-GRB afterglows is
required for a more robust conclusion.

Sagittarius A* at the Galactic Center. For the region inside
$1.^{\prime\prime}5$ of the center, we use a {generalized} radiatively
inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, and for the region out to
$10^{\prime\prime}$ we use published models of the ambient hot gas. We
calculate the equivalent widths of Hydrogen-like and Helium-like emission lines
of various elements, notably iron. We predict that a strong Helium-like iron
line with an equivalent width $\sim1$ keV should be emitted by both the
external medium and the RIAF. The equivalent width in the external medium is
sensitive to the metallicity $Z$ of the gas as well as the mean temperature.
For reasonable choices of these parameters, the calculated results agree with
Chandra's detection of an iron line with an equivalent width of 1.3 keV within
$10^{\prime\prime}$. The emission from within $1.^{\prime\prime}5$ is not
sensitive to the external temperature, but is sensitive to the density and,
especially, temperature profile inside the Bondi radius. For the range of
profiles we consider, we calculate the equivalent width of the iron line to be
$\sim0.6-1.5 (Z/Z_\odot)$ keV, where $Z_\odot$ is the solar metallicity. We
present a new Chandra spectrum of the quiescent emission within
$1.^{\prime\prime}5$ of Sgr A*. The measured equivalent width of the iron line

universally observed in thin films that grow via the Volmer-Weber mode. The
commonly accepted mechanism for the origin of this tensile stress is a process
driven by the reduction in surface energy at the expense of the strain energy
associated with the deformation of coalescing islands during grain boundary
formation. In the present work, we have performed molecular statics
calculations using an embedded atom interatomic potential to obtain a
functional form of the interfacial energy vs distance between two closely
spaced free surfaces. The sum of interfacial energy plus strain energy provides
a measure of the total system energy as a function of island separation.
Depending on the initial separation between islands, we find that in cases
where coalescence is thermodynamically favored, gap closure can occur either
spontaneously or be kinetically limited due to an energetic barrier. Atomistic
simulations of island coalescence using conjugate gradient energy minimization
calculations agree well with the predicted stress as a function of island size
from our model of spontaneous coalescence. Molecular dynamics simulations of
island coalescence demonstrate that only modest barriers to coalescence can be
overcome at room temperature. A comparison with thermally activated coalescence
results at room temperature reveals that existing coalescence models
significantly overestimate the magnitude of the stress resulting from island
coalescence.

provides a means to separate measured values of anisotropy parameters from

best possible trade-off between the rate and error-correction radius.
Specifically, for every $0 < R < 1$ and $\eps> 0$, we present an explicit
construction of error-correcting codes of rate $R$ that can be list decoded in
polynomial time up to a fraction $(1-R-\eps)$ of {\em worst-case} errors. At
least theoretically, this meets one of the central challenges in algorithmic
coding theory.
  Our codes are simple to describe: they are {\em folded Reed-Solomon codes},
which are in fact {\em exactly} Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, but viewed as a code
over a larger alphabet by careful bundling of codeword symbols. Given the
ubiquity of RS codes, this is an appealing feature of our result, and in fact
our methods directly yield better decoding algorithms for RS codes when errors
occur in {\em phased bursts}.
  The alphabet size of these folded RS codes is polynomial in the block length.
We are able to reduce this to a constant (depending on $\eps$) using ideas
concerning ``list recovery'' and expander-based codes from
\cite{GI-focs01,GI-ieeejl}. Concatenating the folded RS codes with suitable
inner codes also gives us polynomial time constructible binary codes that can
be efficiently list decoded up to the Zyablov bound, i.e., up to twice the
radius achieved by the standard GMD decoding of concatenated codes.

"physics/0511170","Jianhua Xiao","Jianhua Xiao","Evolution of Continuum from Elastic Deformation to Flow","25 pages, no figures",,,,"physics.class-ph",,"  Traditionally, the deformation of continuum is divided into elastic, plastic,
and flow. For a large deformation with cracking, they are combined together.
So, for complicated deformation, a formulation to express the evolution of
deformation from elastic to flow will help to understand the intrinsic relation
among the related parameters which relate the deformation with a stress field.
To this purpose, Eringen polar decomposition and Trusedell polar decomposition
are formulated by explicit formulation of displacement field, based on Chen
additive decomposition of deformation gradient. Then the strain introduced by
the multiplicative decomposition and the strain introduced by the additive
decomposition are formulated explicitly with displacement gradient. This
formulation clears the intrinsic contents of strains defined by taking the
Eringen polar decomposition and Trusedell polar decomposition. After that, it
shows that the plastic deformation can be expressed as the irreversible local
average rotation. For initial isotropic simple elastic material, the
path-dependent feature of classical plasticity theory is naturally expressed in
Chen strain definition. It is founded that for initially isotropic material the
motion equations require a non-symmetric stress for dynamic deformation and a
symmetric stress for static deformation. This controversy between dynamic
deformation and static deformation can be used to explain the cracking or
buckling of solid continuum. Finally, the research shows that the flow motion
of continuum can be expressed by the same formulation system. So, it forms an
evolution theory from elastic deformation to flow of continuum.

index, for which topological sum rules are derived. The paradox of the the
missing diabolical points for Fe8 molecular magnets is clarified. A new method
is also developed to provide a simple interpretation, in terms of destructive
interferences due to the Berry phase, of the complete set of diabolical points
found in biaxial systems such as Fe8.

quantify important physical resources and are frequently used in quantum
information science. They are usually calculated from a full description of a
quantum state, even though they depend only on a small number parameters that
specify the state. Here we extract a non-local and a non-linear quantity,
namely the Renyi entropy, from local measurements on two pairs of polarization
entangled photons. We also introduce a ""phase marking"" technique which allows
to select uncorrupted outcomes even with non-deterministic sources of entangled
photons. We use our experimental data to demonstrate the violation of entropic
inequalities. They are examples of a non-linear entanglement witnesses and
their power exceeds all linear tests for quantum entanglement based on all
possible Bell-CHSH inequalities.

examine an aspect of this claim I generalize the ideal measurement model to
include translational degrees of freedom for both the measured system and the
measuring apparatus. Analysis of this generalized model using the Everett
interpretation in the Heisenberg picture shows that it makes unambiguous
predictions for the possible results of measurements and their respective
probabilities. The presence of translational degrees of freedom for the
measuring apparatus affects the probabilities of measurement outcomes in the
same way that a mixed state for the measured system would. Examination of a
measurement scenario involving several observers illustrates the consistency of
the model with perceived spatial localization of the measuring apparatus.

  Demonstration of N-Photon de Broglie Wavelength","8 pages, 3 figures, new title, some content change, replaced Fig.1",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.023808",,"quant-ph",,"  We construct a projection measurement process for the maximally entangled
N-photon state (the NOON-state) with only linear optical elements and
photodetectors. This measurement process will give null result for any N-photon
state that is orthogonal to the NOON state. We examine the projection process
in more detail for N=4 by applying it to a four-photon state from type-II
parametric down-conversion. This demonstrates an orthogonal projection
measurement with a null result. This null result corresponds to a dip in a
generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer for four photons. We find that the
depth of the dip in this arrangement can be used to distinguish a genuine
entangled four-photon state from two separate pairs of photons. We next apply
the NOON state projection measurement to a four-photon superposition state from
two perpendicularly oriented type-I parametric down-conversion processes. A
successful NOON state projection is demonstrated with the appearance of the
four-photon de Broglie wavelength in the interference fringe pattern.
