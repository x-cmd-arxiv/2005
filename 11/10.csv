  Final version in press","Phys.Rev.D73:103001,2006","10.1103/PhysRevD.73.103001",,"astro-ph",,"  The cosmic 21-cm background frequency spectrum related to the spin-flip
transition of neutral Hydrogen present during and before the era of
reionization is rich in features associated with physical processes that govern
transitions between the two spin states. The intervening electrons in
foreground galaxy clusters inversely Compton scatter the 21-cm background
spectrum and modify it just as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum
is modified by inverse-Compton scattering. Towards typical galaxy clusters at
low redshifts, the resulting modification is a few tenths milli-Kelvin
correction to the few tens milli-Kelvin temperature of 21-cm signal relative to
that of the cosmic microwave background black body spectrum. The modifications
are mostly associated with sharp changes in the cosmic 21-cm background
spectrum such as due to the onset of a Lyman-$\alpha$ radiation field or
heating of neutral gas. Though low frequency radio interferometers that are now
planned for 21-cm anisotropy measurements are insensitive to the mean 21-cm
spectrum, differential observations of galaxy clusters with these
interferometers can be utilized to indirectly establish global features in the
21-cm frequency spectrum. We discuss the feasibility to detect the spectrum
modified by clusters and find that for upcoming interferometers, while a
detection towards an individual cluster is challenging, one can average signals
over a number of clusters, selected based on the strength of the
Sunyave-Zel'dovich effect at high radio frequencies involving CMB scattering
alone, to establish the mean 21-cm spectrum.

well-mixed with ashes of nuclear burning and its extent determines the rise
time of the burst light curve. Using a full nuclear reaction network, we show
that the maximum vertical extent of the convective region during photospheric
radius expansion (RE) bursts can be sufficiently great that: (1) some ashes of
burning are ejected by the radiation driven wind during the RE phase and, (2)
some ashes of burning are exposed at the neutron star surface following the RE
phase. We find that ashes with mass number A ~ 30 - 60 are mixed in with the
ejected material. We calculate the expected column density of ejected and
surface ashes in hydrogen-like states and determine the equivalent widths of
the resulting photoionization edges from both the wind and neutron star

detection would probe the nuclear burning processes and might enable a
measurement of the neutron star gravitational redshift. In addition, we find
that in bursts with pure helium burning layers, protons from (alpha, p)
reactions cause a rapid onset of the 12C(p, gamma)13N(alpha, p)16O reaction
sequence. The sequence bypasses the relatively slow 12C(alpha, gamma)16O

bursts (SHBs), suggests that they typically result from long-lived progenitor
systems. The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double
neutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such
events are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by
ground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB
observations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation
of the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection
of these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic
time, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can
reproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux
distribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical
progenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the
typical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution
is a power-law with index \eta then \eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \sigma c.l.). This
result is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic
DNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the
observed galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that
the local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several
orders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that
SHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO
event rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is
not negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic
radiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories.

approximated central energy equipartition between stars of different masses is
usually imposed by scaling the velocity parameter of each mass class inversely
with the stellar mass, as if the distribution function were isothermal. In this
paper, this 'isothermal approximation' (IA) has been checked and its
consequences on the model parameters studied by a comparison with models
including central energy equipartition correctly. It is found that, under the
IA, the 'temperatures' of a pair of components can differ to a non-negligible
amount for low concentration distributions. It is also found that, in general,
this approximation leads to a significantly reduced mass segregation in
comparison with that given under the exact energy equipartition at the centre.
As a representative example, an isotropic 3-component model fitting a given
projected surface brightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles is
discussed. In this example, the IA gives a cluster envelope much more
concentrated (central dimensionless potential W=3.3) than under the true
equipartition (W=0.059), as well as a higher logarithmic mass function slope.
As a consequence, the inferred total mass (and then the global mass-to-light
ratio) results a factor 1.4 times lower than the correct value and the amount
of mass in heavy dark remnants is 3.3 times smaller. Under energy
equipartition, the fate of stars having a mass below a certain limit is to
escape from the system. This limit is derived as a function of the mass and W
of the giants and turn-off stars component.

the peak energy is lower by a factor of 4. We study the optical and X-Ray
afterglow properties of the XRRs/XRFs; in particular we analyze the XRR 011030
afterglow. We find that the X-ray and optical flux distributions and the
lightcurves of the XRRs/XRFs sample are consistent with those of classical
GRBs; in particular, they show evidence of a break and no rising temporal
slope. We compare these results with the afterglow predictions of the high
redshift scenario, where XRFs are GRBs at higher redshift and of the off-axis
scenario, where the observed differences are due to viewing angle effects. In
this last framework, we consider jets with a homogeneous, a -2 power-law shaped
and a Gaussian luminosity angular distribution.
  We find that the high redshift scenario can explain some events but not the
total sample of XRRs/XRFs. The off-axis model may be consistent with our
findings when a homogeneous jet is considered. However, given the uncertainties
on the selection effects in our sample, a Gaussian jet viewed at small angles
from the Gaussian core and a power-law shaped cannot be ruled out.

Revised for better presentation","Phys.Rev.D74:123004,2006","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.123004",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  We examine coherent active-active channel neutrino flavor evolution in
environments where neutrino-neutrino forward scattering can engender
large-scale collective flavor transformation. We point out a key quantity, the
""total effective energy"", which is conserved in several important regimes.
Using this concept, we analyze collective neutrino and antineutrino flavor
oscillation in the ""synchronized"" mode and what we term the ""bi-polar"" mode. We
thereby are able to explain why large collective flavor mixing can develop on
short timescales even when vacuum mixing angles are small in, e.g., a dense gas
of initially pure $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ with an inverted neutrino mass
hierarchy (an example of bi-polar oscillation). In the context of the spin
precession analogy, we find that the co-rotating frame provides insights into
more general systems, where either the synchronized or bi-polar modes could
arise. For example, we use the co-rotating frame to demonstrate how large
flavor mixing in the bi-polar mode can occur in the presence of a large and
dominant matter background. We use the adiabatic condition to derive a simple
criterion for determining whether the synchronized or bi-polar mode will occur.
Based on this criterion we predict that neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted
from a proto-neutron star in a core-collapse supernova event can experience
synchronized and bi-polar flavor transformations in sequence before
conventional Mikhyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) flavor evolution takes over.
This certainly will affect the analyses of future supernova neutrino signals,
and might affect the treatment of shock re-heating rates and nucleosynthesis
depending on the depth at which collective transformation arises.

luminosity to an AGN, consistent with X-ray observations, if the AGN is heavily
obscured and emits mostly in the far-infrared. This ambiguity arises because
the intrinsic variation of properties among a given galaxy population (e.g.,
starbursts) introduces at least a factor of a few uncertainty even into the
most robust AGN-starburst diagnostics. We conclude that with present
observations it is not possible to determine the dominant power source in
galaxies when AGN and starburst luminosities are within a factor of a few of
each other.

observed to spin up steadily, others to alternate between spin-up and spin-down
states, sometimes superimposed on a longer trend of either spin up or spin
down. Here we interpret this rich phenomenology within a new model of the
disk-magnetosphere interaction. Our model, based on the simplest version of a
purely material torque, accounts for the fact that, when a neutron star is in
the propeller regime, a fraction of the ejected material does not receive
enough energy to completely unbind, and hence falls back into the disk. We show
that the presence of this feedback mass component causes the occurrence of
multiple states available to the system, for a given, constant value of the
mass accretion rate dot{M}_* from the companion star. If the angle chi of the
magnetic dipole axis with respect to the perpendicular to the disk is larger
than a critical value chi_crit, the system eventually settles in a cycle of
spin-up/spin-down transitions for a constant value of dot{M}_* and independent
of the initial conditions. No external perturbations are required to induce the
torque reversals. The transition from spin up to spin down is often accompanied
by a large drop in luminosity. The frequency range spanned in each cycle and
the timescale for torque reversals depend on dot{M}_*, the magnetic field of
the star, the magnetic colatitude chi, and the degree of elasticity regulating
the magnetosphere-disk interaction. The critical angle chi_crit ranges from
\~25-30 deg for a completely elastic interaction to ~40-45 deg for a totally
anelastic one. For chi ~< chi_crit, cycles are no longer possible and the
long-term evolution of the system is a pure spin up. We specifically illustrate
our model in the cases of the X-ray binaries GX 1+4 and 4U 1626-67.

from hot to cold flows by Dekel & Birnboim (2005).
  Here we explore whether globular cluster (GC) systems also reveal a bimodal
nature with regard to this critical mass scale. Globular clusters probe star
formation at early epochs in the Universe and survive subsequent galaxy mergers
and accretions. We use new data from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (Peng etal

Virgo early-type galaxies covering a range of five hundred in galaxy mass.
Their classification of the GC color distributions is taken to examine a key
quantity -- the number of GCs per unit galaxy luminosity. Below the critical
mass, this quantity (called the GC specific frequency) increases dramatically
in its mean value and spread. This increase may be due to regulated star
formation in low mass galaxies, which in turn is due to mass loss via winds and
the transition from hot to cold gas accretion flows. We also note that above
the critical mass, galaxies possess two GC subpopulations (with blue and red
mean colors) but below this mass, galaxies reveal an increasing proportion of
single (blue) GC systems.

cooling rate almost cancel. The result is an oscillatory mode of burning, with
an oscillation period close to the geometric mean of the thermal and accretion
timescales for the burning layer. We describe a simple one-zone model which
illustrates this basic physics, and then present detailed multizone
hydrodynamical calculations of nuclear burning close to the stability boundary
using the KEPLER code. Our models naturally explain the characteristic 2 minute
period of the mHz QPOs, and why they are seen only in a very narrow range of
X-ray luminosities. The oscillation period is sensitive to the accreted
hydrogen fraction and the surface gravity, suggesting a new way to probe these

appear in the theoretical models is an order of magnitude larger than the rate
implied by the X-ray luminosity when the mHz QPOs are seen. We discuss the
implications for our general understanding of nuclear burning on accreting

surrounding diffuse thermal emission from hot gas, which is detectable on

our direct view of the SMBH. We have estimated the temperature and density of
the hot interstellar medium, which is one major source of fuel for the
accreting SMBH; typical central densities are n_e ~ (0.02 +/- 0.01) cm^{-3}.
Assuming that the hot gas is captured by the SMBH at the Bondi rate, we show
that the observed X-ray luminosities are too faint to be consistent with
standard disk accretion, but brighter than predicted by radiatively-inefficient
solutions (eg, ADAF). In total, there are ~ 20 galaxies for which SMBH mass,
hot gas density, and nuclear X-ray luminosity are simultaneously known. In some
cases, the nuclear sources are brighter than predicted by the ADAF model; in
other cases, they are consistent or fainter. We discuss the apparent lack of
correlations between Bondi rate and X-ray luminosity, and suggest that, in
order to understand the observed distribution, we need to know two additional
parameters: the amount of gas supplied by the stellar population inside the
accretion radius, and the fraction (possibly << 1) of the total gas available
that is accreted by the SMBH. We shall discuss these issues in our Paper II.

waveguides (HMW) presented here are manufactured using micro-machining
techniques. Single-mode behavior has been investigated in laboratory through a
technique of polarization analysis while transmission features have been
measured using flux relative comparison. The single-mode behavior have been
assessed at lambda=10.6 um for rectangular waveguides with dimensions a=10 um
and b<5.3 um with an accuracy of ~2.5 %. The tests have shown that a
single-polarization state can be maintained in the waveguide. A comparison with
results on multi-mode HMW is proposed. Excess losses of 2.4 dB (~ 58 %
transmission) have been measured for a single-mode waveguide. In particular,
the importance of coupling conditions into the waveguide is emphasized here.
The goal of manufacturing and characterizing the first single-mode HMW for the
mid-infrared has been achieved. This opens the road to the use of integrated
optics for interferometry in the mentioned spectral range.

effects are simulated by using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. Cooling
instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes sufficiently
large. We found that as the instability grows the accretion flow changes from
an optically thin, hot, gas pressure-supported state (low/hard state) to a
cooler, magnetically supported, quasi-steady state. During this transition,
magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure because the disk shrinks in the
vertical direction almost conserving the toroidal magnetic flux. Since further
vertical contraction of the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool
disk stays in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically
supported disk, the heating rate balances with the radiative cooling rate. The
magnetically supported disk exists for time scale much longer than the thermal
time scale and comparable to the accretion time scale.
  We examined the stability of the magnetically supported disk analytically,
assuming that the toroidal magnetic flux is conserved, and found it thermally
and secularly stable. Our findings may explain why black hole candidates stay
in luminous, X-ray hard state even when their luminosity exceeds the threshold
for the onset of the cooling instability.

photometry. Our main aim is to set the tightest limits yet on the accuracy of
ABSOLUTE age determinations based on broad-band SEDs, and therefore on the
usefulness of such an approach. Our broad-band SED fits yield reliable ages,
with statistical absolute uncertainties within Delta[log(Age/yr)] = 0.4
overall. The systematic differences we find with respect to previous age
determinations are caused by conversions of the observational photometry to a
different filter system. The LMC's cluster formation rate (CFR) has been
roughly constant outside of the well-known age gap between ~3 and 13 Gyr, when
the CFR was a factor of ~5 lower. We derive the characteristic cluster
disruption time-scale, log(t_4^dis/yr) = 9.9 +- 0.1, where t_dis = t_4^dis
(M_cl/10^4 Msun)^0.62. This long characteristic disruption time-scale implies
that we are observing the INITIAL cluster mass function (CMF). We conclude that
the youngest mass and luminosity-limited LMC cluster subsets show shallower
slopes than the slope of alpha = -2 expected (at least below masses of a few x
10^3 Msun), which is contrary to dynamical expectations. This may imply that
the initial CMF slope of the LMC cluster system as a whole is NOT well
represented by a power-law, although we cannot disentangle the unbound from the
bound clusters at the youngest ages.

spectrum and the emission lines. Using this technique we can detect emission
lines down to an equivalent width of 0.1A set by the current limitations in
describing galaxy spectra with synthetic and real stellar templates, rather
than by the quality of our spectra. Emission is detected in 75% of our sample
galaxies, and comes in a variety of resolved spatial distributions and
kinematic behaviours. The ionised-gas kinematics is rarely consistent with
simple coplanar circular motions. However, the gas almost never displays
completely irregular kinematics, generally showing coherent motions with smooth
variations in angular momentum. In the majority of the cases the gas kinematics
is decoupled from the stellar kinematics, and in half of the objects this
decoupling implies a recent acquisition of gaseous material. Over the entire
sample however, the distribution of the mean misalignment values between
stellar and gaseous angular momenta is inconsistent with a purely external
origin. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of dust features is
always accompanied by gas emission while the converse is not always true. A
considerable range of values for the [OIII]/Hb ratio is found both across the
sample and within single galaxies. Despite the limitations of this ratio as an
emission-line diagnostic, this finding suggests either that a variety of
mechanisms is responsible for the gas excitation in E and S0 galaxies or that
the metallicity of the interstellar material is quite heterogeneous.

components in clusters. METHODS. The cluster mass profile is determined by
using the Jeans equation applied to the projected phase-space distribution of
about 3000 galaxies members of 59 nearby clusters from the ESO Nearby Abell
Cluster Survey. The baryonic and subhaloes mass components are determined from
the galaxies' luminosity-density profiles through scaling relations between
luminosities and baryonic and dark halo masses. The baryonic mass component
associated to the intra-cluster gas is determined using X-ray data from ROSAT.
RESULTS. The baryon-to-total mass fraction decreases from a value of 0.12 near
the center, to 0.08 at the distance of 0.15 virial radii, then it increases
again, to reach a value of 0.14 at the virial radius. Diffuse, cluster-scale,
dark matter dominates at all radii, but its contribution to the total mass
content decreases outwards to the virial radius, where the dark matter in
subhaloes may contribute up to 23 %, and the baryons 14 %, of the total mass.
The dark mass, and diffuse dark mass profiles are well fit by both cuspy and
cored models. The subhaloes mass distribution is not fit by either model.

conditions, represent a promising class of nonviral, nano-sized vectors for
drug and gene delivery. We performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations
of a generic model dendrimer in a salt-free solution with dendrimer's terminal
beads positively charged. Solvent molecules as well as counterions were
explicitly included as interacting beads. We find that the size of the charged
dendrimer depends non-monotonically on the strength of electrostatic
interactions demonstrating a maximum when the Bjerrum length equals the
diameter of a bead. Many other structural and dynamic characteristics of
charged dendrimers are also found to follow this pattern. We address such a
behavior to the interplay between repulsive interactions of the charged
terminal beads and their attractive interactions with oppositely charged
counterions. The former favors swelling at small Bjerrum lengths and the latter
promotes counterion condensation. Thus, counterions can have a dramatic effect
on the structure and dynamics of charged dendrimers and, under certain
conditions, cannot be treated implicitly.

rate and volume fractions, the type of particle and the observable in the

tracer particles in the system. The temperature becomes independent on the
shear rate for slow enough shear suggesting that it is the effective
temperature of the jammed packing. However, we also show that the agreement of
the effective temperature for different observables is only approximate, for
very long times, suggesting that this defintion may not capture the full
thermodynamics of the system. On the other hand, we find good agreement between
the dynamical effective temperature and a compactivity calculated assuming that
all jammed states are equiprobable. Therefore, this definition of temperature
may capture an instance of the ergodic hypothesis for granular materials as
proposed by theoretical formalisms for jamming. Finally, our simulations
indicate that the average shear stress and apparent shear viscosity follow the

small-momentum optical conductivity due to forward scattering: $\sigma \sim
1/\om$ for $T \ll \om$ and $\sigma \sim T/\om^2$ for $T \gg \om$. Next, within

recover Einstein gravity at short distances because the mass of this scalar
field depends on the background in such a way that it effectively decouples
when one gets close to any source. Remarkably, for the values of the parameters
necessary to explain the cosmic acceleration the induced modifications of
gravity are suppressed at the Solar System level but can be important for
systems like a galaxy.

gravitational instability of massive perturbations. We present arguments to the
effect that the initial conditions problem {\it cannot} be meaningfully
addressed by thermostatistics as far as the gravitational degrees of freedom
are concerned. Rather, the choice of the initial conditions for the universe in
the phase space and the emergence of an arrow of time have to be treated as a
dynamic selection.

contains infinitely many interactions, and therefore one expects very
complicated higher-loop corrections. Remarkably, we find a short and simple
expression for the two-loop dilatation generator. Our solution for the
non-compact su(1,1|2) sector consists of nested commutators of four O(g)
generators and one simple auxiliary generator. Moreover, the solution does not
require the planar limit; we conjecture that it is valid for any gauge group.
To obtain the two-loop dilatation generator, we find the complete O(g^3)
symmetry algebra for this sector, which is also given by concise expressions.
We check our solution using published results of direct field theory
calculations. By applying the expression for the two-loop dilatation generator

  Foundations of the Gauge Invariance Idea","13 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  Soon after the Yang-Mills work, the gauge invariance became one of the basic
principles in the elementary particles theory. The gauge invariance idea is
that Lagrangian has to be invariant not only with respect to the coordinates
transformations corresponding to the Lorentz group (external symmetry). It is
supposed that Lagrangian has also to be invariant with respect to wave
functions (not coordinates) transformations corresponding to some additional
groups (so-called ""internal symmetry groups""). Useful though this idea is,
there is no satisfactory understanding of the above additional symmetries
origin, and the gauge invariance is considered as an auxiliary theoretical
hypotheses. We propose a new, topological interpretation of the basic quantum
mechanical equation -- the Dirac equation, and within the framework of this
interpretation the notions of internal symmetry and gauge invariance bear a
simple geometrical meaning and are natural consequences of the basic principles
of the proposed geometrical description. According to this interpretation the
Dirac equation proves to be the group-theoretical relation that accounts for
the symmetry properties of a specific 4-manifold -- localized microscopic
deviation of the space-time geometry from the Euclidean one. This manifold
covering space plays the role of the internal space, and the covering space
automorphism group plays the role of the gauge group.

  references added",,,,"hep-th",,"  In this thesis noncommutative gauge theory is extended beyond the canonical
case, i.e. to structures where the commutator no longer is a constant. In the
first part noncommutative spaces created by star-products are studied. We are
able to identify differential operators that still have an undeformed Leibniz
rule and can therefore be gauged much in the same way as in the canonical case.
By linking these derivations to frames (vielbeins) of a curved manifold, it is
possible to formulate noncommutative gauge theories that admit nonconstant
noncommutativity and go to gauge theory on curved spacetime in the commutative
limit. We are also able to express the dependence of the noncommutative
quantities on their corresponding commutative counterparts by using
Seiberg-Witten maps. In the second part we study noncommutative gauge theory in
the matrix theory approach. There, the noncommutative space is a finite
dimensional matrix algebra (fuzzy space) which emerges as the ground state of a
matrix action, the fluctuations around this ground state creating the gauge
theory. This gauge theory is finite, goes to gauge theory on a 4-dimensional
manifold in the commutative limit and can also be used to regularize the
noncommutative gauge theory of the canonical case. In particular, we are able
to match parts of the known instanton sector of the canonical case with the
instantons of the finite theory.

on the set $Z$ where $f$ is not surjective. The main property is that if $\phi$
is a holomorphic section of $Q$, and $R^f\phi=0$, then locally $f\psi=\phi$ has
a holomorphic solution $\psi$. In the generic case also the converse holds.
This gives a generalization of the corresponding theorem for a complete

polynomial mappings, related to M Noether's theorem and the effective
Nullstellensatz. The construction of the current is based on a generalization

point of $f^{m}$ and the fixed point index $\mu_{f^{m}}(0)$ of $f^{m}$ at the

this framework, including acyclic colourings, star colourings, and distance-2
colourings. This paper studies $F$-free colourings of the cartesian product of
graphs.
  Let $H$ be the cartesian product of the graphs $G_1,G_2,...,G_d$. Our main
result establishes an upper bound on the $F$-free chromatic number of $H$ in
terms of the maximum $F$-free chromatic number of the $G_i$ and the following
number-theoretic concept. A set $S$ of natural numbers is $k$-multiplicative
Sidon if $ax=by$ implies $a=b$ and $x=y$ whenever $x,y\in S$ and $1\leq a,b\leq
k$. Suppose that $\chi(G_i,F)\leq k$ and $S$ is a $k$-multiplicative Sidon set
of cardinality $d$. We prove that $\chi(H,F) \leq 1+2k\cdot\max S$. We then
prove that the maximum density of a $k$-multiplicative Sidon set is
$\Theta(1/\log k)$. It follows that $\chi(H,F) \leq O(dk\log k)$. We illustrate
the method with numerous examples, some of which generalise or improve upon
existing results in the literature.

redundancy is a way of ""smoothening"" fitness landscapes. Therefore, redundancy

involving valence electron. Triple excitations of core electrons are included
in the fourth-order of many-body perturbation theory. In addition,
contributions from the disconnected excitations are incorporated. Evaluation of
matrix elements includes all-order dressing of lines and vertices of the
diagrams. The resulting formalism for matrix elements is complete through the
fourth order and sums certain chains of diagrams to all orders. With the
developed method we compute removal energies, magnetic-dipole
hyperfine-structure constants A and electric-dipole amplitudes. We find that
the removal energies are reproduced within 0.01-0.03% and the hyperfine
constants of the 3s_1/2 and 3p_1/2 states with a better than 0.1% accuracy. The
computed dipole amplitudes for the principal 3s_1/2 - 3p_1/2;3/2 transitions
are in an agreement with 0.05%-accurate experimental data.

Dow Jones Industrial Averaged (DJIA) [1-3]. Specifically, we argued that the
natural candidate for such statistics is the investment horizons distribution.
This is the distribution of waiting times needed to achieve a predefined level
of return obtained from detrended historic asset prices. Such a distribution
typically goes through a maximum at a time coined the {\em optimal investment
horizon}, $\tau^*_\rho$, which defines the most likely waiting time for
obtaining a given return $\rho$. By considering equal positive and negative
levels of return, we reported in [2,3] on a quantitative gain/loss asymmetry
most pronounced for short horizons. In the present paper, this gain/loss
asymmetry is re-visited for 2/3 of the individual stocks presently in the DJIA.
We show that this gain/loss asymmetry established for the DJIA surprisingly is
{\em not} present in the time series of the individual stocks. The most
reasonable explanation for this fact is that the gain/loss asymmetry observed
in the DJIA as well as in the SP500 and Nasdaq are due to movements in the
market as a whole, {\it i.e.}, cooperative cascade processes (or
``synchronization'') which disappear in the inverse statistics of the
individual stocks.

are non-coding parts within genes, while the remaining non-coding parts are
intergenic sequences. To study the evolutionary significance of recombination
inside introns we have used two models based on the Monte Carlo method. In our
computer simulations we have implemented the internal structure of genes by
declaring the probability of recombination between exons. One situation when
inside-intron recombination is advantageous is recovering functional genes by
combining proper exons dispersed in the genetic pool of the population after a
long period without selection for the function of the gene. Populations have to
pass through the bottleneck, then. These events are rather rare and we have
expected that there should be other phenomena giving profits from the
inside-intron recombination. In fact we have found that inside-intron
recombination is advantageous only in the case when after recombination,
besides the recombinant forms, parental haplotypes are available and selection
is set already on gametes.

topology. Among its many connections to various mathematical and physical
areas, it is known (due to Witten) to be intimately connected to Topological
Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). The works of Freedman, Kitaev, Larsen and Wang
provide an efficient simulation of TQFT by a quantum computer, and vice versa.
These results implicitly imply the existence of an efficient quantum algorithm
that provides a certain additive approximation of the Jones polynomial at the
fifth root of unity, e^{2\pi i/5}, and moreover, that this problem is
BQP-complete. Unfortunately, this important algorithm was never explicitly
formulated. Moreover, the results mentioned are heavily based on TQFT, which
makes the algorithm essentially inaccessible to computer scientists.
  We provide an explicit and simple polynomial quantum algorithm to approximate
the Jones polynomial of an n-strands braid with m crossings at any primitive
root of unity e^{2\pi i/k}, where the running time of the algorithm is
polynomial in m,n and k. Our algorithm is based, rather than on TQFT, on well
known mathematical results. By the results of Freedman et. al., our algorithm
solves a BQP complete problem.
  The algorithm we provide exhibits a structure which we hope is generalizable
to other quantum algorithmic problems. Candidates of particular interest are
the approximations of other #P-hard problems, most notably, the partition
function of the Potts model, a model which is known to be tightly connected to
the Jones polynomial.

are resistant to systematic errors in their implementation. Single qubit gates
based on the BB1 family of composite rotations have been experimentally
demonstrated in a variety of systems, but little study has been made of their
application in extended computations, and there has been no experimental study
of the corresponding robust two qubit gates to date. Here we describe an
application of robust gates to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies of
approximate quantum counting. We find that the BB1 family of robust gates is
indeed useful, but that the related NB1, PB1, B4 and P4 families of tailored
logic gates are less useful than initially expected.
