magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the presence of a strong large-scale external
magnetic field. We argue that in the inertial range of scales, magnetic-field
and velocity-field fluctuations tend to align the directions of their
polarizations. However, the perfect alignment cannot be reached, it is
precluded by the presence of a constant energy flux over scales. As a
consequence, the directions of fluid and magnetic-field fluctuations at each
scale $\lambda$ become effectively aligned within the angle
$\phi_{\lambda}\propto \lambda^{1/4}$, which leads to scale-dependent depletion
of nonlinear interaction and to the field-perpendicular energy spectrum
$E(k_{\perp})\propto k_{\perp}^{-3/2}$. Our results may be universal, i.e.,
independent of the external magnetic field, since small-scale fluctuations
locally experience a strong field produced by large-scale eddies.

Universe. Instruments such as Compton-GRO/BATSE and the GRB monitor on BeppoSAX
have detected more than 2700 GRBs and, although observational confirmation is
still required, it is now generally accepted that many of these bursts are
associated with the collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars to form black
holes. Consequently, since first generation stars are expected to be very
massive, GRBs are likely to have occurred in significant numbers at early
epochs. X-red is a space mission concept designed to detect these extremely
high redshifted GRBs, in order to probe the nature of the first generation of
stars and hence the time of reionisation of the early Universe. We demonstrate
that the gamma and x-ray luminosities of typical GRBs render them detectable up
to extremely high redshifts (z~10-30), but that current missions such as HETE2
and SWIFT operate outside the observational range for detection of high
redshift GRB afterglows. Therefore, to redress this, we present a complete
mission design from the science case to the mission architecture and payload,
the latter comprising three instruments, namely wide field x-ray cameras to
detect high redshift gamma-rays, an x-ray focussing telescope to determine
accurate coordinates and extract spectra, and an infrared spectrograph to
observe the high redshift optical afterglow. The mission is expected to detect
and identify for the first time GRBs with z > 10, thereby providing constraints
on properties of the first generation of stars and the history of the early
Universe.

our outcome reinforces the view that sub-keplerian flows of matter may
significantly affect the physics of the high energy radiation emission from

Taking into account published Halpha spectroscopy that shows that five of the

bag of objects, both obscured (N_H>1e22 cm^{-2}) and unobscured (N_H<1e22

There is evidence that some bursts have a large gamma-ray efficiency, which may
be due to strong magnetic fields in their ejecta. The bright GRB050525A shows
behaviour broadly consistent with expectations from the simple fireball model
for bursts, including evidence for a reverse shock component in the UVOT data,
and an achromatic break in decay slope indicative of a jet break. Other bursts
observed with Swift have a shallow decay initially which is difficult to
reconcile with the simple model. Replenishment of the forward shock energy by
continued ejection of material from the central engine, or initial injection of
material with a range of velocities, offers a potential explanation. In the
case of the XRF050406 an initially rising optical afterglow flux followed by a
shallow decay may be due to observation of a structured jet from a significant

nebula are examined using 3-D MHD calculations in the shearing-box
approximation with vertical stratification. The turbulence is driven by the
magneto-rotational instability. The magnetic and hydrodynamic stresses in the
turbulence correspond to an accretion time at the midplane about equal to the
lifetimes of T Tauri disks, while accretion in the surface layers is thirty
times faster. The mixing resulting from the turbulence is also fastest in the
surface layers. The mixing rate is similar to the rate of radial exchange of
orbital angular momentum, so that the Schmidt number is near unity. The
vertical spreading of a trace species is well-matched by solutions of a damped
wave equation when the flow is horizontally-averaged. The damped wave
description can be used to inexpensively treat mixing in 1-D chemical models.
However, even in calculations reaching a statistical steady state, the
concentration at any given time varies substantially over horizontal planes,
due to fluctuations in the rate and direction of the transport. In addition to
mixing species that are formed under widely varying conditions, the turbulence
intermittently forces the nebula away from local chemical equilibrium. The
different transport rates in the surface layers and interior may affect
estimates of the grain evolution and molecular abundances during the formation
of the Solar system.

galaxies with the Spitzer space telescope are consistent with pure populations
of very old stars with no evidence of younger stars. Most of the stars in giant
elliptical galaxies are old but the mean stellar age determined from Balmer
absorption in optical spectra can appear much younger due to a small admixture
of younger stars. The mean stellar age can also be determined from the spectral
energy distribution in the mid-infrared which decreases with time relative to
the optical emission and shifts to shorter wavelengths. The observed flux
ratios F_8um/F_3.6um and F_24um/F_3.6um for elliptical galaxies with the oldest
Balmer line ages are lower than predicted by recent models of single stellar
populations. For ellipticals with the youngest Balmer line ages in our sample,
3-5 Gyrs, the flux ratios F_24um/F_3.6um are identical to those of the oldest
stars. When theoretical mid-IR spectra of old (12 Gyr) and young stellar
populations are combined, errors in the F_24um/F_3.6um observations are
formally inconsistent with a mass fraction of young stars that exceeds ~1%.
This is less than the fraction of young stars expected in discussions of recent
surveys of elliptical galaxies at higher redshifts. However, this inconsistancy
between Balmer line ages and those inferred from mid-IR observations must be
regarded as provisional until more accurate observations and theoretical
spectra become available. Finally, there is no evidence to date that central
disks or patches of dust commonly visible in optical images of elliptical

some sources down to V=23.2. In particular we identify 21 cluster members in
the cluster inner region, from which we derive a velocity dispersion of
\sigma=960 km/s, corresponding to a total mass of 7.1 x 10^{13} solar masses

the mass distribution of cluster galaxy halos we construct a detailed lensing
mass model leading to a total mass of 2.9 x 10^{13} solar masses within the
Einstein radius (16 arcsec). The lensing mass and dynamical mass are in good
agreement although the dynamical one is much less accurate. Comparing these

Although the X-ray temperature matches the dynamical and lensing estimates, the
published NFW mass model derived from the X-ray measurement with its small
concentration of c ~3 can not account for the large Einstein radius observed in
this cluster. A larger concentration of ~6 would however match the strong

neither of these difficulties can be removed if clouds are ionized and
invisible at 21cm as they leave the disc but become visible at some point on

early-type galaxies, and in a larger sample from the literature, confirmed
(Soria et al., Paper I) that the Bondi accretion rate of diffuse hot gas is not
a good indicator of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) X-ray luminosity. Here
we suggest that a more reliable estimate of the accretion rate must include the
gas released by the stellar population inside the sphere of influence of the
SMBH, in addition to the Bondi inflow of hot gas across that surface. We use
optical surface-brightness profiles to estimate the mass-loss rate from stars
in the nuclear region: we show that for our sample of galaxies it is an order
of magnitude higher (~ 10^{-4} - 10^{-3} M_sun/yr) than the Bondi inflow rate
of hot gas, as estimated from Chandra (Paper I). Only by taking into account
both sources of fuel can we constrain the true accretion rate, the accretion
efficiency, and the power budget. Radiatively efficient accretion is ruled out,
for quiescent SMBHs. For typical radiatively inefficient flows, the observed
X-ray luminosities of the SMBHs imply accretion fractions ~ 1 - 10% (ie, ~ 90 -
99% of the available gas does not reach the SMBH) for at least five of our six
target galaxies, and most of the other galaxies with known SMBH masses. We
discuss the conditions for mass conservation inside the sphere of influence, so
that the total gas injection is balanced by accretion plus outflows. We show
that a fraction of the total accretion power (mechanical plus radiative) would
be sufficient to sustain a self-regulating, slow outflow which removes from the
nuclear region all the gas that does not sink into the BH (``BH feedback'').
The rest of the accretion power may be carried out in a jet, or advected. We
also discuss scenarios that would lead to an intermittent nuclear activity.

Spitzer value. Global properties of 1E0657-56 are also remarkable. Despite
being extremely unrelaxed, the cluster fits well on the Lx-T relation, yet its
total mass estimated from the M-T relation is more than twice the value
measured from lensing. This is consistent with simulations predicting that in
the middle of a merger, global temperature and X-ray luminosity may be
temporarily boosted by a large factor.

exact global stationary configurations for both axisymmetric and
nonaxisymmetric coplanar MHD perturbations in such a composite MSID system and
proposed the MHD $D_s-$criteria for axisymmetric stability by the hydrodynamic
analogy. In a different perspective, we derive and analyze here the
time-dependent WKBJ dispersion relation in the low-frequency and tight-winding
regime to examine axisymmetric stability properties. By introducing a
rotational Mach number $D_s$ for the ratio of the stellar rotation speed $V_s$
to the stellar velocity dispersion $a_s$, one readily determines the stable
range of $D_s^2$ numerically to establish the $D_s-$criteria for axisymmetric
MSID stability. Those MSID systems rotating either too fast (ring ragmentation)
or too slow (Jeans collapse) are unstable. Our WKBJ results of (M)SID
instability provide physically compelling explanations for the stationary
analysis of Lou & Zou. We further introduce an effective MHD $Q$ parameter for
a composite MSID system and compare with the earlier work of Elmegreen, Jog and
Shen & Lou. As expected, an axisymmetric dark matter halo enhances the
stability against axisymmetric disturbances in a composite partial MSID system.

  II, Proc. SPIE 5905, 2005","10.1117/12.616564",,"astro-ph",,"  One of the science drivers for the extremely large telescope (ELT) is imaging
and spectroscopy of exo-solar planets located as close as 20mas to their parent
star. The application requires a well thought-out design of the high contrast
imaging instrumentation. Several working coronagraphic concepts have already
been developed for the monolithic telescope with the diameter up to 8 meter.
Nevertheless the conclusions made about the performance of these systems cannot
be applied directly to the telescope of the diameter 30-100m. The existing
schemes are needed to be reconsidered taking into account the specific
characteristics of a segmented surface. We start this work with the classical
system ? Lyot coronagraph. We show that while the increase in telescope
diameter is an advantage for the high contrast range science, the segmentation
sets a limit on the performance of the coronagraph. Diffraction from
intersegment gaps sets a floor to the achievable extinction of the starlight.
Masking out the bright segment gaps in the Lyot plane although helps increasing
the contrast, does not solve completely the problem: the high spatial frequency
component of the diffractive light remains. We suggest using the Lyot stop
which acts on the light within gaps in order to produce the uniform
illumination in the Lyot plane. We show that for the diffraction limit regime
and a perfect phasing this type of coronagraph achieves a sufficient star light
extinction.

excitations, or quasiparticles - fundamental quanta of energy and momentum.
Various strongly-interacting atomic systems are successfully treated as a
collection of quasiparticles with weak or no interactions. However, there are
interesting limitations to this description: the very existence of
quasiparticles cannot be taken for granted in some systems. Like unstable
elementary particles, quasiparticles cannot survive beyond a threshold where
certain decay channels become allowed by conservation laws - their spectrum
terminates at this threshold. This regime of quasiparticle failure was first
predicted for an exotic state of matter, super-fluid helium-4 at temperatures
close to absolute zero - a quantum Bose-liquid where zero-point atomic motion
precludes crystallization. Using neutron scattering, here we show that it can
also occur in a quantum magnet and, by implication, in other systems with
Bose-quasiparticles. We have measured spin excitations in a two dimensional
(2D) quantum-magnet, piperazinium hexachlorodicuprate (PHCC) in which spin-1/2
copper ions form a non-magnetic quantum spin liquid (QSL), and find remarkable
similarities with excitations measured in superfluid 4He. There is a threshold
momentum beyond which the quasiparticle peak merges with the two-quasiparticle
continuum. It then acquires a finite energy width and becomes indistinguishable
from a leading-edge singularity, so that lowest excited states occupy a wide
band of energy. Our findings have important ramifications for understanding
phenomena involving excitations with gapped spectra in many condensed matter
systems, including high-transition-temperature superconductors.

(1998)]. In the boundary part we obtain a cutoff independent term which is
linear in T and determines the temperature dependence of the boundary
susceptibility in the attractive regime for $T\ll 1$. We further show that at
particular anisotropies where contributions from irrelevant operators with
different scaling dimensions cross, logarithmic corrections appear. We give
explicit formulas for these terms at those anisotropies where they are most
important. We verify our results by comparing with extensive numerical
calculations based on a numerical solution of the T=0 Bethe ansatz equations,
the finite temperature Bethe ansatz equations in the quantum-transfer matrix
formalism, and the density-matrix renormalisation group applied to transfer
matrices.

interactions in different complex systems. Areas of investigation span from
biology to engineering, physics and the social sciences. Although having
different microscopic dynamics, the results demonstrate that most systems under
consideration tend to self-organize into structures that share common features.
In particular, the networks of interaction are characterized by a power law
distribution, $P(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, in the number of connections per node,
$k$, over several orders of magnitude. Networks that fulfill this propriety of
scale-invariance are referred to as ``scale-free''. In the present work we
explore the implication of scale-free topologies in the antiferromagnetic (AF)
Ising model and in a stochastic model of opinion formation. In the first case
we show that the implicit disorder and frustration lead to a spin-glass phase
transition not observed for the AF Ising model on standard lattices. We further
illustrate that the opinion formation model produces a coherent, turbulent-like
dynamics for a certain range of parameters. The influence, of random or
targeted exclusion of nodes is studied.

the wavelength becomes comparable to the transport mean free path $\ell^*$ [3].
The signatures of localization and those of absorption, or bound states, can

localization in disordered bulk materials is still lacking. Here we present
measurements of time resolved non-classical diffusion of visible light in
strongly scattering samples, which cannot be explained by absorption, sample

width and spacing of quasimodes, \delta, are key indicators of electronic and
classical wave localization when inelastic processes are absent. However, these
can no longer serve as localization parameters in absorbing samples since the
affect of absorption depends upon the length of the trajectories of partial
waves traversing the sample, which are superposed to create the scattered
field. A robust determination of localization in the presence of absorption is
found, however, in steady-state measurements of the statistics of radiation
transmitted through random samples. This is captured in a single parameter, the
variance of the total transmission normalized to its ensemble average value,
which is equal to the degree of intensity correlation of the transmitted wave,
\kappa. The intertwined effects of localization and absorption can also be
disentangled in the time domain since all waves emerging from the sample at a
fixed time delay from an exciting pulse, t, are suppressed equally by
absorption. As a result, the relative weights of partial waves emerging from
the sample, and hence the statistics of intensity fluctuations and correlation,
and the suppression of propagation by weak localization are not changed by
absorption, and manifest the growing impact of weak localization with t.

small non-symmetric degrees of freedom for the symmetric evolution. This serves
as a model for the general situation of perturbative degrees of freedom in a
background independent quantization such as loop quantum gravity, and for the
more complicated addition of perturbative inhomogeneities. While being crucial
for cosmological phenomenology, it is shown that perturbative non-symmetric
degrees of freedom do not allow definitive conclusions for the singularity
issue and in such a situation could even lead to wrong claims.

partons from the colour charged remnant plays an important role in
proton-proton collisions a similar model for soft scatterings in a quark-gluon
plasma was constructed and implemented as a Monte Carlo event generator. The
main emphasis was put on the question to what extend these soft scatterings can
contribute to the energy loss that an energetic parton suffers, when it
traverses a quark-gluon plasma. It was found that the soft scattering can
account for up to 50% of the observed energy loss.
  Furthermore, it was investigated what information present data reveal about
the general features of partonic energy loss. This study was carried out with a
Monte Carlo model that includes the full simulation of the quark-gluon plasma
but uses a more general ansatz for the energy loss which makes it possible to
emulate different scenarios like coherent gluon bremsstrahlung, scattering etc.
Unfortunately, it turned out that it is difficult to differentiate between them
so that at present no clear decision in favour of one or the other is possible.

is assumed to be a non-centre element of the gauge group SU(n) as most
appropriate for QCD applications in the confined phase. It is shown that a
charge k caloron can be seen as a collection of nk massive magnetic monopoles
each carrying fractional topological charge. This interpretation offers a
physically appealing way of introducing monopole degrees of freedom into pure
gluodynamics: as constituents of finite temperature instantons. New and exact
solutions are found along with the fermionic zero-modes of the Dirac operator.
The properties of the zero-modes are analysed as well as the hyperkahler and
twistor geometry of the caloron moduli space. Lattice gauge theoretic
applications are also mentioned.

independence of the pinched gluon self-energy from gauge-fixing parameters, and
the absence of unphysical thresholds in the resummed propagators permits a
complete check of the optical theorem for the off-shell two-point function. The
known anomalous (tachyonic) dispersion relations are recovered within this
framework, as well as their improved version in the (softly broken) SUSY case.
These applications should be considered as a first step in constructing
gauge-invariant truncations of the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the
non-commutative case. An interesting result of our formalism appears when
considering the theory in two dimensions: we observe a finite gauge-invariant
contribution to the photon mass because of a novel incarnation of IR/UV mixing,
which survives the commutative limit when matter is present.

Ricci-Hamilton flow. We remark that using our idea, D.Kokotov and D.Korotkin
[Normalized Ricci Flow on Riemann Surfaces and Determinant of Laplacian,
Letters in Mathematical Physics, 71(3)(2005)241-242] can give a simple proof of
the fact that the determinant of Laplace operator in a smooth metric over
compact Riemann surfaces of an arbitrary genus g monotonously grows under the
normalized Ricci flow. Together with results of Hamilton and B.Chow that under
the action of the normalized Ricci flow a smooth metric tends asymptotically to
the metric of constant curvature, this leads to a simple proof of the
Osgood-Phillips-Sarnak theorem stating that within the class of smooth metrics
with fixed conformal class and fixed volume the determinant of the Laplace
operator is maximal on the metric of constant curvature. One may consider
similar problems for other geometric flow and other elliptic operators, such as
Yamabe flow, or Kahler-Ricci flow.

plasmon oscillations of different symmetry in this case. A new type of the

which totally disappear at separation of the spheres, has been discovered. The
found plasmon oscillations have a dramatic effect on optical properties of an

equations in vacuum in order to clarify Faraday's law of induction. Using this
procedure, the Lorentz force is no longer separate from Maxwell's equations.
The Lorentz transformations are shown to be related to the convective
derivative, which is introduced in the electrodynamics of moving bodies. The
new formulation is in complete agreement with the actual set of Maxwell's
equations for bodies at rest, the only novel feature is a new kind of
electromotive force. Heinrich Hertz was the first to propose a similar
electrodynamic theory of moving bodies, although its interpretation was based
on the existence of the so called ""aether"". Examining the problem of a moving
circuit with this procedure, it is shown that a new force of induction should
act on a circuit moving through an inhomogeneous vector potential field. This
overlooked induction force is related to the Aharanov-Bohm effect, but can also
be related to the classical electromagnetic field when an external magnetic
field is acting on the system. Technological issues, such as the so called
Marinov motor are also addressed.

provides us a simple mechanism based on randomness which develops
self-organization through both winner/looser effects and relaxation process. A

different approach: by means of a discrete scheme we develop a mean field
approximation that not only reproduces the phase transition but also allows us
to characterize the complexity of hierarchic phase. In the same philosophy, we
study a new version of the Bonabeau model, developed by Stauffer et al. Several
previous works described numerically the presence of a similar phase transition
in this later version. We find surprising results in this model that can be
interpreted properly as the non-existence of phase transition in this version

switching on target genes. We apply this system to Drosophila embryos, where we
predict the existence of a hitherto undetected posterior co-repressor. Using

learning kernel) between incoming spikes and the internal state of the
postsynaptic neuron, building upon previous studies of spike timing dependent
synaptic plasticity (\cite{KGvHW,KGvH1,vH}). Our learning rule for the synaptic
weight $w_{ij}$ is $$ \dot w_{ij}(t)= \epsilon \int_{-\infty}^\infty
\frac{1}{T_l} \int_{t-T_l}^t \sum_\mu \delta(\tau+s-t_{j,\mu}) u(\tau) d\tau\
\Gamma(s)ds $$ where the $t_{j,\mu}$ are the arrival times of spikes from the
presynaptic neuron $j$ and the function $u(t)$ describes the state of the
postsynaptic neuron $i$. Thus, the spike-triggered average contained in the
inner integral is weighted by a kernel $\Gamma(s)$, the learning window,
positive for negative, negative for positive values of the time diffence $s$
between post- and presynaptic activity. An antisymmetry assumption for the
learning window enables us to derive analytical expressions for a general class
of neuron models and to study the changes in input-output relationships
following from synaptic weight changes. This is a genuinely non-linear effect
(\cite{SMA}).

between a two-level atom with photon recoil and a quantized field mode in an
ideal cavity, the basic model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). It is
shown that the Jaynes-Cummings dynamics can be unstable in the regime of
chaotic walking of the atomic center-of-mass in the quantized field of a
standing wave in the absence of any kind of interaction with environment. This
kind of quantum instability manifests itself in strong variations of reduced
quantum purity and entropy, correlating with the respective classical Lyapunov
exponent, and in exponential sensitivity of fidelity of quantum states to small
variations in the atom-field detuning. The connection between quantum
entanglement and fidelity and the center-of-mass motion is clarified
analytically and numerically for a few regimes of that motion. The results are
illustrated with two specific initial field states: the Fock and coherent ones.
Numerical experiments demonstrate various manifestations of the
quantum-classical correspondence, including dynamical chaos and fractals, which
can be, in principle, observed in real experiments with atoms and photons in
high finesse cavities.

is defined by the geometry of the periodic dielectric pattern, cavity control

is limited by the read-out channel, or in a high Q cavity, it is nearly
decoupled from the external world, making measurement of the state extremely
challenging. We present here a method for ameliorating these difficulties by
using a coupled cavity arrangement, where one cavity acts as a switch for the
other cavity, tuned by control of the atomic transition.
