relativistic, strongly magnetized, weakly baryon loaded magnetic clouds,
somewhat analogous to solar coronal mass ejection (CME) events. Flares are
driven by unwinding of internal non-potential magnetic fields which leads to
slow build-up of magnetic energy outside of the neutron star. For large
magnetospheric currents, corresponding to a large twist of external magnetic
field, magnetosphere becomes dynamically unstable on \Alfven crossing times
scale of inner magnetosphere, $t_A \sim R_{NS}/c \sim 30 \mu$sec. Released
magnetic energy results in formation of a strongly magnetized, pair-loaded,
quasi-spherically expanding flux rope, topologically connected by magnetic
field to the neutron star during the prompt flare emission. Magnetic stresses
of the tied flux rope lead to late collimation of the expansion, on time scales
longer than giant flare duration. Relativistic bulk motion of the expanding
magnetic cloud, directed at an angle $\theta \sim 135^\circ$ to the line of
sight (away from the observer), results in a strongly non-spherical forward
shock with observed non-relativistic apparent expansion and bulk motion
velocities $\beta_{app} \sim \cot \theta/2 \sim 0.4 $ at times of first radio
observations approximately one week after the burst. Interaction with a shell
of wind-shocked ISM and then with the unshocked ISM leads to deceleration to
non-relativistic velocities approximately one month after the flare.

the canonical ensemble. (Only in this case this is equivalent to the
fundamental microcanonical ensemble.) However, some 170 years ago the original
motivation of thermodynamics was the description of steam engines, i.e. boiling
water. Its essential physics is the separation of the gas phase from the
liquid. Of course, boiling water is inhomogeneous and as such cannot be treated
by conventional thermo-statistics. Then it is not astonishing, that a phase
transition of first order is signaled canonically by a Yang-Lee singularity.
Thus it is only treated correctly by microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck
statistics. It turns out that the Boltzmann-Planck statistics is much richer
and gives fundamental insight into statistical mechanics and especially into
entropy. This can be done to a far extend rigorously and analytically. As no
extensivity, no thermodynamic limit, no concavity, no homogeneity is needed, it
also applies to astro-physical systems. The deep and essential difference
between ``extensive'' and ``intensive'' control parameters, i.e. microcanonical
and canonical statistics, is exemplified by rotating, self-gravitating systems.
In the present paper the necessary appearance of a convex entropy S(E) and
negative heat capacity at phase separation in small as well macroscopic systems
independently of the range of the force is pointed out. Thus the old puzzle of
stellar statistics is finally solved, the appearance of negative heat capacity
which is forbidden and cannot appear in the canonical formalism.

spectra span the range ~3600-6800A with a resolution of ~14A FWHM, being used
to determine cluster ages and, in connection with their spatial distribution,
to explore the LMC structure and cluster formation history. Cluster reddening
values were estimated by interpolation, using the available extinction maps. We
used two methods to derive cluster ages: (i) template matching, in which line
strengths and continuum distribution of the cluster spectra were compared and
matched to those of template clusters with known astrophysical properties, and
(ii) equivalent width (EW) method, in which new age/metallicity calibrations
were used together with diagnostic diagrams involving the sum of EWs of
selected spectral lines (KCaII, G band (CH), MgI, Hdelta, Hgamma and Hbeta).
The derived cluster ages range from 40Myr (NGC2130 and SL237) to 300Myr
(NGC1932 and SL709), a good agreement between the results of the two methods
being obtained. Combining the present sample with additional ones indicates
that cluster deprojected distances from the LMC center are related to age in
the sense that inner clusters tend to be younger. Spectral libraries of star
clusters are useful datasets for spectral classifications and extraction of
parameter information for target star clusters and galaxies. The present
cluster sample complements previous ones, in an effort to gather a spectral
library with several clusters per age bin.

combine with simultaneous radio observations with the Ryle telescope. Both
spectral and variability properties of the source indicate that Cygnus X-1 was
in an Intermediate State. The INTEGRAL spectrum shows a high-energy cut-off or
break around 100 keV. The shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermal
Comptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higher
energies.The average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybrid
thermal/non-thermal Comptonisation models. During the 4 day long observation
the source showed an important spectral and flux variability. A principal
component analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2
independent modes. The first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosity
on time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikingly
uncorrelated with the variable radio flux. We interpret this variability mode
as variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. The second variability
mode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts on a longer
time-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of the
observation and then softens again. This pivoting pattern is strongly
correlated with the radio (15 GHz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when the
INTEGRAL spectrum is harder. We propose that the pivoting mode represents a
'mini' state transition from a nearly High Soft State to a nearly Low Hard
State, and back. This mini-transition would be caused by changes in the soft
cooling photons flux in the hot Comptonising plasma associated with an increase
of the temperature of the accretion disc. The jet power then appears to be
anti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.

the gas-phase abundance measured at a fixed galactocentric radius, as
determined by the HII-region abundance gradient. The typical scatter in the
correlation is +/-0.1 dex, independent of the abundance calibration, or whether
the observed integrated emission-line fluxes, the reddening-corrected fluxes,
or the emission-line equivalent widths are used. Integrated abundances based on
the observed fluxes or equivalent widths, however, are susceptible to
additional systematic effects of order 0.05-0.1 dex, at least for the range of
reddenings and stellar populations spanned by our sample. Unlike the integrated
R23 parameter, we find that the integrated [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha

consistent with a modest contribution from diffuse-ionized gas emission. We
conclude that the R23 parameter can be used to reliably measure the gas-phase
abundances of distant star-forming galaxies.

and radiative interior using a two-dimensional model of its equatorial plane.
The background reference state is a one-dimensional solar structure model.
Turbulent convection in the outer convection zone continually excites gravity
waves which propagate throughout the stable radiative interior and deposit
their angular momentum. We find that angular velocity variations in the
tachocline are driven by angular momentum transported by overshooting
convective plumes rather than the nonlinear interaction of waves. The mean flow
in the tachocline is time dependent but not oscillatory in direction. Since the
forcing in this shallow region can not be described by simple linear waves, it
is unlikely that the interaction of such waves is responsible for the solar
cycle or the 1.3 year oscillation. However, in the deep radiative interior, the
interaction of low amplitude gravity waves, continually excited by the
overshooting plumes, is responsible for the angular velocity deviations
observed there. Near the center of the model sun the angular velocity deviation
is about two orders of magnitude greater than that in the bulk of the radiative
region and reverses its direction (prograde to retrograde or vice versa) in the
opposite sense of the angular velocity deviations that occur in the tachocline.
Our simulations thus demonstrate how angular velocity variations in the solar
core are linked to those in the tachocline, which themselves are driven by

that ensures an accurate and detailed description of the line absorption and
anomalous Zeeman splitting. The set of model atmospheres was calculated for the
field strengths between 1 and 40 kG. The high-resolution energy distribution,
photometric colors and the hydrogen Balmer line profiles are computed for
magnetic stars with different metallicities and are compared to those of

results of modelling confirmed the main outcomes of the previous study: energy
redistribution from UV to the visual region and flux depression at 5200A.

polarized radiation takes place are smaller in comparison to those obtained in
our first paper where polarized radiative transfer was neglected. Also we found
that the peculiar photometric parameter delta_a is not able to clearly
distinguish stellar atmospheres with abundances other than solar, and is less
sensitive than delta(V_1-G) or Z to a magnetic field for low effective

each two electron integral and not to the total energy. It is proposed that the
appropriate fitting functions be charge neutral and that all ab initio energies
be evaluated using two-center fits of the two-electron integrals. The SR method
has its root in the Slater's Xalpha method and permits an arbitrary scaling of
the Slater-Gaspar-Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation potential around each atom in
the system. Of several ways of choosing the scaling factors (Slater's exchange
parameters), two most obvious are the Hartree-Fock (HF), alpha_HF, values and
the exact atomic, alpha_EA, values. The performance of this simple analytic
model with both sets for atomization energies of G2 set of 148 molecules is
better than the local density approximation or the HF theory, although the
errors in atomization energy are larger than the target chemical accuracy.
  To improve peformance for atomization energies, the SR method is
reparametrized to give atomization energies of 148 molecules to be comparbale
to those obtained by one of the most widely used generalized gradient
approximations. The mean absolute error in ionization potentials of 49 atoms
and molecules is about 0.5 eV and that in bond distances of 27 molecules is

substrate is studied using the interface displacement model. First, the

condition of constant volume is considered. By assuming a cylindrical
liquid-vapor surface (meniscus) and minimizing the total free energy, we derive
an equation for the apparent contact angle, which is similar but different from
the well-known Cassie's law. Next, using this modified Cassie's law as a guide
to predict the behavior of a droplet on a heterogeneous striped surface, we
examine several scenarios of contact angle hysteresis using a periodically
striped surface model. By changing the volume of the droplet, we predict a
sudden jump of the droplet edge, and a continuous change of the apparent
contact angle at the edge of two stripes. Our results suggest that as drop
volume is increased (advancing contact lines), the predominant drop
configuration observed is the one whose contact angle is large; whereas,
decreasing drop volume from a large value (receding contact lines) yields drop
configuration that predominantly exhibit the smaller contact angle.

is the precise equivalent to Euclid's algorithm over the reals to calculate the
continued fraction expansion of a formal power series. The continued fraction
expansion allows to deduce the linear and jump complexity profiles of the input
sequence. Since K is an isometry, the resulting F_q^\infty-sequence is i.i.d.
for i.i.d. input. Hence the linear and jump complexity profiles may be modelled
via Bernoulli experiments (for F_2: coin tossing), and we can apply the very
precise bounds as collected by Revesz, among others the Law of the Iterated

  pion Spectra","15 pages, 7 figures",,,,"nucl-th",,"  Au+Au, $\sqrt{s} = 200$ A GeV measurements at RHIC, obtained with the PHENIX,
STAR, PHOBOS and BRAHMS detectors, have all indicated a suppression of
production, relative to an appropriately normalized NN level. For central
collisions and vanishing pseudo-rapidity these experiments indicate a
considerable reduction, relative to that nominally expected from equivalent PP
measurements, in charged and particle production, especially at mid- to large
transverse momenta. In the PHENIX experiment similar behavior has been reported
for $\pi^0$ spectra. In a recent work \cite{luc4brahms} on the presumably
simpler D+Au interaction, to be considered perhaps as a tune-up for Au+Au, we
reported on a hadronic cascade mechanism which can explain the observed
moderatereduced $p_\perp$ suppression at higher pseudorapidity as well as the
Cronin enhancement at mid- rapidity. Here we present the extension of this work
to the more massive ion-ion collisions.

to an explicit interpretation of many of the phenomena of elementary quantum
mechanics. We examine characteristics of a repetitively impacted submicroscopic
particle in conjunction with examination of the ways in which effects
associated with the particle's behavior appear in moving frames of reference.
As seen from relatively moving frames of reference, the time and location of
impacts and recoils automatically exhibit wave behavior. This model leads to
free particle waves with frequencies proportional to the energy and wavelengths
inversely proportional to the momentum. As seen from relatively moving frames
of reference, impacts and their associated recoils can appear to an observer to
take place simultaneously at multiple locations in space. For superposed free
particle waves corresponding to bidirectional motion, an amplitude that varies
sinusoidally with distance results. A governing equation identical in form to
the Schroedinger equation is developed that describes the behavior of the
impacts and their associated recoils. This approach permits many features of
quantum mechanics to be examined within an intuitively visualizable framework.

a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of
its intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend
increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. We
propose to formulate the validation of a given model as an iterative
construction process that mimics the often implicit process occurring in the
minds of scientists. We offer a formal representation of the progressive
build-up of trust in the model. We thus replace static claims on the
impossibility of validating a given model by a dynamic process of constructive
approximation. This approach is better adapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained
nature of validation. Our procedure factors in the degree of redundancy versus
novelty of the experiments used for validation as well as the degree to which
the model predicts the observations. We illustrate the new methodology first
with the maturation of Quantum Mechanics as the arguably best established
physics theory and then with several concrete examples drawn from some of our
primary scientific interests: a cellular automaton model for earthquakes, a
multifractal random walk model for financial time series, an anomalous
diffusion model for solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a
computational fluid dynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

disciplines have turned to clustering as a tool for data analysis and
exploration. Existing clustering methods, however, typically depend on several
nontrivial assumptions about the structure of data. Here we reformulate the
clustering problem from an information theoretic perspective which avoids many
of these assumptions. In particular, our formulation obviates the need for
defining a cluster ""prototype"", does not require an a priori similarity metric,
is invariant to changes in the representation of the data, and naturally
captures non-linear relations. We apply this approach to different domains and
find that it consistently produces clusters that are more coherent than those
extracted by existing algorithms. Finally, our approach provides a way of
clustering based on collective notions of similarity rather than the
traditional pairwise measures.

  $^{24}$Mg$^+$","23 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) is an exact method for
calculating the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary subsystem interacting
linearly with the radiation field. Applications of the theory have however been
few due to the intractable nature of the variational-differential NMQSD
evolution equation. Recently, we argued that the variational-differential
equation can be rewritten as an integrodifferential equation which can be
readily solved numerically. This manuscript provides an explicit derivation of
the modified equations. Applications to intermittent fluorescence in
$^{24}$Mg$^+$ are discussed in detail. Earlier speculations that quantum jumps
occur on all time scales are verified on a picosecond timescale. We show that a
plot of the probability density of the signal vs signal strength shows the two
characteristic peaks associated with the bright and dark manifolds, and that
the ratio of the areas under the peaks is 16 as observed experimentally. We
also show that the shape of this distribution is sensitive to bath memory, but
has a mathematical form common to both the Markovian and non-Markovian cases.

In particular, we consider N-qubit symmetric Dicke states with N/2 excitations.
In the first part of the paper we show that for large N these states have the
smallest overlap possible with states without genuine multi-partite
entanglement. Thus these states are particulary well suited for the
experimental examination of multi-partite entanglement. We present
fidelity-based entanglement witness operators for detecting multipartite
entanglement around these states. In the second part of the paper we consider
entanglement criteria, somewhat similar to the spin squeezing criterion, based
on the moments or variances of the collective spin operators. Surprisingly,
these criteria are based on an upper bound for variances for separable states.
We present both criteria detecting entanglement in general and criteria
detecting only genuine multi-partite entanglement. The collective operator
measured for our criteria is an important physical quantity: Its expectation
value essentially gives the intensity of the radiation when a coherent atomic
cloud emits light.
