variations at the 10^{-5} level around its black-body equilibrium temperature.
The detection of these temperature fluctuations provides to modern Cosmology
evidence for the existence of primordial density perturbations that seeded all
the structures presently observed. The vast majority of the cosmological
information is contained in the 2-point temperature function, which measures
the angular correlation of these temperature fluctuations distributed on the
celestial sphere. Here we study such angular correlations using a recently
introduced statistic-geometrical method. Moreover, we use Monte Carlo simulated
CMB temperature maps to show the equivalence of this method with the 2-point
temperature function (best known as the 2-Point Angular Correlation Function).
We also investigate here the robustness of this new method under possible
divisions of the original catalog-data in sub-catalogs. Finally, we show some
applications of this new method to simple cases.

are undertaking a photometric survey of all known galaxy-mass strong lenses to
characterize their environments and include them in careful lens modeling, and
to build a large, uniform sample of galaxy groups at intermediate redshifts for
evolutionary studies. In this paper we present wide-field photometry of the
environments of twelve lens systems with 0.24 < z_lens < 0.5. Using a
red-sequence identifying technique, we find that eight of the twelve lenses lie
in groups, and that ten group-like structures are projected along the line of
sight towards seven of these lenses. Follow-up spectroscopy of a subset of
these fields confirms these results. For lenses in groups, the group centroid
position is consistent with the direction of the external tidal shear required
by lens models. Lens galaxies are not all super-L_* ellipticals; the median
lens luminosity is < L_*, and the distribution of lens luminosities extends 3
magnitudes below L_* (in agreement with theoretical models). Only two of the
lenses in groups are the brightest group galaxy, in qualitative agreement with
theoretical predictions. As in the local Universe, the highest
velocity-dispersion groups contain a brightest member spatially coincident with
the group centroid, whereas lower-dispersion groups tend to have an offset
brightest group galaxy. This suggests that higher-dispersion groups are more
dynamically relaxed than lower-dispersion groups and that at least some evolved
groups exist by z ~ 0.5.

group of galaxies in six of the eight systems in our sample. We discover three
new groups associated with the lens galaxies of BRI 0952-0115 (five members),
MG 1654+1346 (seven members), and B2114+022 (five members). We more than double
the number of members for another three previously known groups around the
lenses MG 0751+2716 (13 total members), PG 1115+080 (13 total members), and
B1422+231 (16 total members). We determine the kinematics of the six groups,
including their mean velocities, velocity dispersions, and projected spatial
centroids. The velocity dispersions of the groups range from 110 +170, -80 to
470 +100, -90 km/s. In at least three of the lenses -- MG0751, PG1115, and
B1422 -- the group environment significantly affects the lens potential. These
lenses happen to be the quadruply-imaged ones in our sample, which suggests a
connection between image configuration and environment. The lens galaxy is the
brightest member in fewer than half of the groups. Our survey also allows us to
assess for the first time whether mass structures along the line of sight are
important for lensing. We first show that, in principle, the lens potential may
be affected by line-of-sight structures over a wide range of spatial and
redshift offsets from the lens. We then quantify real line-of-sight effects
using our survey and find that at least four of the eight lens fields have
substantial interloping structures close in projection to the lens, and at
least one of those structures (in the field of MG0751) significantly affects
the lens potential.

We show that the dynamical equation allows self similar evolution for the

creates initially a holographic shower in bulk AdS. The subsequent
gravitational fall leads to a moving black hole that is gravity dual to the
expanding and cooling heavy-ion fireball. The front of the fireball cools at
the rate of $1/\tau$, while the core cools as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ from a
cosmological-like argument. The cooling is faster than Bjorken cooling. The
fireball freezes when the dual black hole background is replaced by a confining
background through the Hawking-Page transition.

content by means of stereoscopic displays, one needs to transmit and display at
least 2 points of view of the video content. This has profound implications on
the resources required to transmit the content, as well as demands on the
complexity of the visualization system. It is known that stereoscopic images
are redundant, which may prove useful for compression and may have positive
effect on the construction of the visualization device. In this paper we
describe an experimental evaluation of data redundancy in color stereoscopic
images. In the experiments with computer generated and real life and test
stereo images, several observers visually tested the stereopsis threshold and
accuracy of parallax measuring in anaglyphs and stereograms as functions of the
blur degree of one of two stereo images and color saturation threshold in one
of two stereo images for which full color 3D perception with no visible color
degradations is maintained. The experiments support a theoretical estimate that
one has to add, to data required to reproduce one of two stereoscopic images,
only several percents of that amount of data in order to achieve stereoscopic
perception.

species is the reconstruction of the ancestral relationships. The most
established approach to tree reconstruction is the maximum likelihood (ML)
method. In this method, evolution is described in terms of a discrete-state
continuous-time Markov process on a phylogenetic tree. The substitution rate
matrix, that determines the Markov process, can be estimated using the
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Unfortunately, an exhaustive search
for the ML phylogenetic tree is computationally prohibitive for large data
sets. In such situations, the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used
because of its computational speed. The NJ method reconstructs trees by
clustering neighboring sequences recursively, based on pairwise comparisons
between the sequences. The NJ method can be generalized such that
reconstruction is based on comparisons of subtrees rather than pairwise
distances. In this paper, we present an algorithm for simultaneous substitution
rate estimation and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The algorithm iterates
between the EM algorithm for estimating substitution rates and the generalized
NJ method for tree reconstruction. Preliminary results of the approach are
encouraging.
