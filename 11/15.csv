cosmological context, may provide a measure of primordial CP violation during
baryogenesis. Yet it is difficult, even in principle, to devise a scheme by
which magnetic helicity may be detected, except in some very special systems.
We propose that charged cosmic rays originating from known sources may be
useful for this purpose. We show that the correlator of the arrival momenta of
the cosmic rays is sensitive to the helicity of an intervening magnetic field.
If the sources themselves are not known, the method may still be useful
provided we have some knowledge of their spatial distribution.

dust allow an improved understanding of the spectrum of emission from each of
these components. Here we examine the sky variation at intermediate latitudes
using a cross-correlation technique. In particular, we compare the observed
emission in 15 selected sky regions to three ``standard'' templates.
  The free-free emission of the diffuse ionised gas is fitted by a well-known
spectrum at K and Ka band, but the derived emissivity corresponds to a mean
electron temperature of ~4000-5000K. This is inconsistent with estimates from
galactic HII regions. The origin of the discrepancy is unclear.
  The anomalous emission associated with dust is clearly detected in most of
the 15 fields studied; it correlates well with the Finkbeiner et al. model 8
predictions (FDS8) at 94 GHz, with an effective spectral index between 20 and
60GHz of -2.85. Furthermore, the emissivity varies by a factor of ~2 from cloud
to cloud. A modestly improved fit to the anomalous dust at K-band is provided
by modulating the template by an estimate of the dust colour temperature,
specifically FDS8*T^n. We find a preferred value n~1.6.
  The synchrotron emission steepens between GHz frequencies and the WMAP bands.
There are indications of spectral index variations across the sky but the
current data are not precise enough to accurately quantify this from region to
region. Our analysis of the WMAP data indicates strongly that the
dust-correlated emission at the low WMAP frequencies has a spectrum which is
compatible with spinning dust; we find no evidence for a synchrotron component
correlated with dust (abridged).

exhibits a Na I doublet and CO overtone bandheads in the K band, and Al I and K
I lines and an FeH bandhead in the H band, all of which have strengths more
typical of field M dwarfs. Furthermore the spectrum of Gl 406 (M6 V) provides a

collapse of ionized gas in small protogalactic halos using three-dimensional,
smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Our initial conditions represent
protogalaxies forming within a fossil HII region -- a previously ionized HII
region which has not yet had time to cool and recombine. Prior to cosmological
reionization, such regions should be relatively common, since the
characteristic lifetimes of the likely ionizing sources are significantly
shorter than a Hubble time. We show that in these regions, H_2 is the dominant
and most effective coolant, and that it is the amount of H_2 formed that
determines whether or not the gas can collapse and form stars.
  At the low metallicities (Z < 10^{-3} Z_sun) thought to be associated with
the transition from population III to early population II star formation, metal
line cooling has an almost negligible effect on the evolution of low density
gas, altering the density and temperature evolution of the gas by less than 1%
compared to the metal-free case at densities below 1 cm^{-3} and temperatures
above 2000 K. Although there is evidence that metal line cooling becomes more
effective at higher density, we find no significant differences in behaviour
from the metal-free case at any density below our sink particle creation
threshold at n = 500 cm^{-3}. Increasing the metallicity also increases the
importance of metal line cooling, but it does not significantly affect the
dynamical evolution of the low density gas until Z = 0.1 Z_sun. This result
holds regardless of whether or not an ultraviolet background is present.

the CESAM code and taking into account the most recent physics. The effective
temperature ranges from $\approx$ 4700 K to $\approx$ 6400 K and therefore
concerns objects on the so-called Spite plateau and cooler. We find the $^7$Li
pre main sequence depletion is unable to account for the observations in the
halo whatever the effective temperature. This supports microscopic diffusion
and an additional non standard mixing process both acting during the main
sequence. On the contrary the models $^6$Li pre main sequence depletion appears
too strong and is marginally compatible with recent detections.
  During the main sequence we introduce the effects of tachocline diffusion.
This process is a rotationnally induced mixing acting at the top of the
radiative core. We show that the differences in the early rotation history
cannot result in scattered lithium abundances on the Spite plateau. Moreover
the tachocline mixing process predicts $^7$Li abundances in good agreement with
the observations. We briefly address the question of turn off $^7$Li poor
stars. A modest accretion of lithium free matter would be enough to explain
their low abundance in this element.
  We expect the scatter in $^7$Li abundances is correlated to variations in
[Fe/O] ratio for dwarfs cooler than 5500 K. Finally the tachocline mixing is
robust with respect to the recent $^6$Li observations around the turn-off. We
similarly suggest the [Fe/O] should be higher in objects with $^6$Li and
effective temperature below 6000 K.

composite-colored binaries in the ""Catalogue of Spectroscopically Identified

estimate the temperature and gravity of the late-type star, taking into account

scenario for post-AGB remnant stars of 0.5842 and 0.5885 \msun. Results are
based on a detailed treatment of the physical processes responsible for the
chemical abundance changes. We considered two theories of convection: the
standard mixing length theory (MLT) and the double-diffusive GNA convection
developed by Grossman et al. The latter accounts for the effect of the chemical
gradient ($\nabla\mu$) in the mixing processes and in the transport of energy.
We also explore the dependence of the born-again evolution on some physical
hypothesis, such as the effect of the existence of non-zero chemical gradients,
the prescription for the velocity of the convective elements and the size of
the overshooting zones. Attention is given to the behavior of the born-again
times and to the chemical evolution during the ingestion of protons. We find
that in our calculations born again times are dependent on time resolution. In
particular when the minimum allowed time step is below $5 \times 10^{-5}$ yr we
obtain, with the standard mixing length theory, born again times of 5-10 yr.
This is true without altering the prescription for the efficiency of convective
mixing during the proton ingestion. On the other hand we find that the
inclusion of the chemical gradients in the calculation of the mixing velocity
tend to increase the born again times by about a factor of two. In addition we
find that proton ingestion can be seriously altered if the occurrence of
overshooting is modified by the $\nabla\mu$-barrier at the H-He interface,
strongly altering born again times.

X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 does not fit in any of these groups, and deserves a
detailed study to understand how the transfer of matter and the accretion on to
the compact object take place. To this end we study an IUE spectrum of the
donor and obtain a wind terminal velocity (v_inf) of ~350 km/s, which is
abnormally slow for its spectral type. We also analyse here more than 9 years
of available RXTE/ASM data. We study the long-term X-ray variability of the
source and find it to be similar to that observed in the wind-fed supergiant
system Vela X-1, reinforcing the idea that 4U 2206+54 is also a wind-fed
system. We find a quasi-period decreasing from ~270 to ~130 d, noticed in
previous works but never studied in detail. We discuss possible scenarios and
conclude that long-term quasi-periodic variations in the mass-loss rate of the
primary are probably driving such variability in the measured X-ray flux. We
obtain an improved orbital period of 9.5591 d with maximum X-ray flux at MJD
51856.6. Our study of the orbital X-ray variability in the context of wind
accretion suggests a moderate eccentricity around 0.15. Moreover, the low value
of v_inf solves the long-standing problem of the relatively high X-ray
luminosity for the unevolved nature of the donor, BD +53 2790, which is
probably an O9.5 V star. We note that changes in v_inf and/or the mass-loss
rate of the primary alone cannot explain the diferent patterns displayed by the
orbital X-ray variability. We finally emphasize that 4U 2206+54, together with
LS 5039, could be part of a new population of wind-fed HMXBs with main sequence
donors, the natural progenitors of supergiant X-ray binaries. (Abridged)

velocity dispersions as functions of galaxy radius are derived by deconvolving
line-of-sight velocity distributions. A maximum rotation v_rot=8 km/s inside
half the effective radius (re~20 arcsec) and a mean, radially flat velocity
dispersion sigma=44 km/s are measured. The core extending over the inner 2
arcsec (~140 pc) is found to rotate in the opposite sense with v_rot(core) ~
-1/2 v_rot. VCC 510 (M_B ~ -15.7) is therefore by far the faintest and smallest
galaxy with a counter-rotating core known. From the main body rotation and the
velocity dispersion profile we deduce that VCC 510 is anisotropic and clearly
not entirely supported by rotation. By comparison of Lick absorption-line
indices with stellar population models we derive an old luminosity-weighted age
(10 Gyr) and sub-solar metallicity ([Z/H]=-0.4) inside the effective radius.
There is tentative evidence that the counter-rotating core might be younger and
less alpha/Fe enhanced. From the stellar population parameters we obtain a
total stellar mass-to-light ratio of ~3.6 (M/L_B)_sun which is significantly
lower than a rough dynamical estimate obtained from the kinematics through the
virial theorem (~15). This discrepancy hints toward the possible presence of
dark matter in the centre of VCC 510. We discuss the origin of the
counter-rotating core and exclude fly-by encounters as a viable possibility.
Gas accretion or galaxy merging provide more likely explanations. VCC 510 is
therefore the direct observational evidence that such processes do occur in

either Rb or Pb within these clusters. None of the abundance ratios [Rb/Fe],
[Rb/Zr], or [Pb/Fe] are correlated with the Al abundance. NGC 6752 may have

variance of power estimated by the weightings method substantially exceeds that
estimated from a simple ensemble method. We argue that the discrepancy is
caused by beat-coupling, in which products of closely spaced Fourier modes
couple by nonlinear gravitational growth to the beat mode between them.
Beat-coupling appears whenever nonlinear power is measured from Fourier modes
with a finite spread of wavevector, and is therefore present in the weightings
method but not the ensemble method. Beat-coupling inevitably affects real
galaxy surveys, whose Fourier modes have finite width. Surprisingly, the
beat-coupling contribution dominates the covariance of power at nonlinear
scales, so that, counter-intuitively, it is expected that the covariance of
nonlinear power in galaxy surveys is dominated not by small scale structure,
but rather by beat-coupling to the largest scales of the survey.

estimated from the scatter over many random realizations of the density field.
In the second, we use a novel technique to measure the covariance matrix from
each simulation individually by re-weighting the density field with a carefully
chosen set of functions. The two methods agree at linear scales, but
unexpectedly they disagree substantially at increasingly non-linear scales.
Moreover, the covariance of non-linear power measured using the re-weightings

explanation given in a companion paper, which argues that the cause of the
discrepancy is beat-coupling, in which products of Fourier modes separated by a
small wavevector couple by gravitational growth to the large-scale beat mode
between them. We calculate the information content of the non-linear power

methods and confirm the result of a previous paper, that at translinear scales
the power spectrum contains little information over and above that in the
linear power spectrum, but that there is a marked increase in information at
non-linear scales. We suggest that, in real galaxy surveys, the covariance of
power at non-linear scales is likely to be dominated by beat-coupling to the
largest scales of the survey and that, as a result, only part of the
information potentially available at non-linear scales is actually measurable

value of the normalized moment of inertia, $C/MR^2$, from the location of
Cassini 1 is crucial. If Mercury's spin axis occupies Cassini state 1, its
position defines the location of the state. The spin might be displaced from
the Cassini state if the spin is unable to follow the changes in the state
position induced by the variations in the orbital parameters and the geometry
of the solar system. The spin axis is expected to follow the Cassini state for
orbit variations with time scales long compared to the 1000 year precession
period of the spin about the Cassini state because the solid angle swept out by
the spin axis as it precesses is an adiabatic invariant. Short period
variations in the orbital elements of small amplitude should cause
displacements that are commensurate with the amplitudes of the short period
terms. By following simultaneously the spin position and the Cassini state
position during long time scale orbital variations over past 3 million years
(Quinn {\it et al.}, 1991) and short time scale variations from JPL Ephemeris

non-sinusoidal, so that their Fourier transforms show peaks at eigenfrequencies
of the pulsation modes and at sums and differences of these frequencies. These
combination frequencies provide extra information about the pulsations, both
physical and geometrical, that is lost unless they are analyzed. Several
theories provide a context for this analysis by predicting combination
frequency amplitudes. In these theories, the combination frequencies arise from
nonlinear mixing of oscillation modes in the outer layers of the white dwarf,
so their analysis cannot yield direct information on the global structure of
the star as eigenmodes provide. However, their sensitivity to mode geometry
does make them a useful tool for identifying the spherical degree of the modes
that mix to produce them. In this paper, we analyze data from eight hot,
low-amplitude DAV white dwarfs and measure the amplitudes of combination
frequencies present. By comparing these amplitudes to the predictions of the
theory of Goldreich & Wu, we have verified that the theory is crudely
consistent with the measurements. We have also investigated to what extent the
combination frequencies can be used to measure the spherical degree (ell) of
the modes that produce them. We find that modes with ell > 2 are easily
identifiable as high ell based on their combination frequencies alone.
Distinguishing between ell=1 and 2 is also possible using harmonics. These
results will be useful for conducting seismological analysis of large ensembles

of 0.027 arcsec we precisely establish the relative offsets of H2, [FeII], CO,
HI and NaI components from the source continuum. The H2 and [FeII] peaks are
clearly associated with the jet, while the CO, HI and NaI peaks are spatially
unresolved and coincident with the source, as is expected for emission
associated with accretion processes. The H2 profile along the slit is resolved
into multiple components, which increase in size though decrease in intensity
with distance from the source. This trend might be consistent with thermal
expansion of packets of gas ejected during periods of increased accretion
activity. Indeed, for the brightest component nearest the source, proper motion
measurements indicate a tangential velocity of 0.028 arcsec/year. It therefore
seems unlikely that this emission peak is associated with a stationary zone of
warm gas at the base of the jet. However, the same can not be said for the
[FeII] peak, for which we see no evidence for motion downwind, even though

dust grain distribution function including a full range of grain sizes. The
optical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking into account the
different sublimation temperatures of the silicate and graphite grains, which
solves previously reported inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature in
type-1 AGN. We exploit this model to study the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of 58 extragalactic (both type-1 and type-2) sources using archival
optical and infrared (IR) data. We find that both AGN and starburst
contributions are often required to reproduce the observed SEDs, although in a
few cases they are very well fitted by a pure AGN component. The AGN
contribution to the far-IR luminosity is found to be higher in type-1 sources,
with all the type-2 requiring a substantial contribution from a circum-nuclear
starburst. Our results appear in agreement with the AGN Unified Scheme, since
the distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to be
compatible for type-1 and type-2 AGN. Further support to the unification
concept comes from comparison with medium-resolution IR spectra of type-1 AGN
by the Spitzer observatory, showing evidence for a moderate silicate emission
around 10 \mums which our code reproduces. From our analysis we infer accretion
flows in the inner nucleus of local AGN characterized by high equatorial
optical depths ($A_V\simeq 100$), moderate sizes ($R_{max}<100 pc$) and very

simultaneous coverage allows us to confirm the presence of X-ray pulsations at
~1300 s, that we detect above 20 keV with INTEGRAL for the first time. The
pulse fraction is consistent with being constant with energy, which is
compatible with a model of polar accretion by a pulsar. We study the spectral
properties of IGR J16320-4751 during two major periods occurring during the
simultaneous coverage with both satellites, namely a flare and a non-flare
period. We detect the presence of a narrow 6.4 keV iron line in both periods.
The presence of such a feature is typical of supergiant wind accretors such as
Vela X-1 or GX 301-2. We inspect the spectral variations with respect to the
pulse phase during the non-flare period, and show that the pulse is solely due
to variations of the X-ray flux emitted by the source and not to variations of
the spectral parameters.
  Our results are therefore compatible with the source being a pulsar in a High
Mass X-ray Binary. We detect a soft excess appearing in the spectra as a
blackbody with a temperature of ~0.07 keV. We discuss the origin of the X-ray
emission in IGR J16320-4751: while the hard X-rays are likely the result of
Compton emission produced in the close vicinity of the pulsar, based on energy

formation in interstellar clouds is examined from new wide field imaging of
12CO and 13CO J=1-0 emission from the Rosette and G216-2.5 molecular clouds.
The Rosette molecular cloud is a typical star forming giant molecular cloud and
G215-2.5 is a massive molecular cloud with no OB stars and very little low mass
star formation. The properties of the turbulent gas flow are derived from the
set of eigenvectors and eigenimages generated by Principal Component Analysis
of the spectroscopic data cubes. While the two clouds represent quite divergent
states of star formation activity, the velocity structure functions for both
clouds are similar. The sonic scale, lambda_S, defined as the spatial scale at
which turbulent velocity fluctuations are equivalent to the local sound speed,
and the turbulent Mach number evaluated at 1 pc, M_{1pc}, are derived for an
ensemble of clouds including the Rosette and, G216-2.5 regions that span a
large range in star formation activity. We find no evidence for the positive
correlations between these quantities and the star formation efficiency, that
are predicted by turbulent fragmentation models. A correlation does exist
between the star formation efficiency and the sonic scale for a subset of
clouds with L_{FIR}/M(H_2) > 1 that are generating young stellar clusters.
Turbulent fragmentation must play a limited and non-exclusive role in
determining the yield of stellar masses within interstellar clouds.

89 field spirals, with 0.1 < z < 1, for which we have measured confident
rotation velocities (Vrot). By plotting the residuals from the local TFR versus
redshift, or alternatively fitting the TFR to our data in several redshift
bins, we find evidence that luminous spiral galaxies are increasingly offset
from the local TFR with redshift, reaching a brightening of -1.0+-0.5 mag, for
a given Vrot, by approximately z = 1. Since selection effects would generally
increase the fraction of intrinsically-bright galaxies at higher redshifts, we
argue that the observed evolution is probably an upper limit.
  Previous studies have used an observed correlation between the TFR residuals
and Vrot to argue that low mass galaxies have evolved significantly more than
those with higher mass. However, we demonstrate that such a correlation may
exist purely due to an intrinsic coupling between the Vrot scatter and TFR
residuals, acting in combination with the TFR scatter and restrictions on the
magnitude range of the data, and therefore it does not necessarily indicate a
physical difference in the evolution of galaxies with different Vrot.
  Finally, if we interpret the luminosity evolution derived from the TFR as due
to the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) in these luminous spiral
galaxies, we find that SFR(z) is proportional to (1+z)^(1.7+-1.1), slower than
commonly derived for the overall field galaxy population. This suggests that
the rapid evolution in the SFR density of the universe observed since
approximately z = 1 is not driven by the evolution of the SFR in individual
bright spiral galaxies. (Abridged.)

and non-Hamiltonian equations of motion by throwing light into the peculiar
geometric structure of phase space. Some fundamental issues regarding time
translation and phase space measure are clarified. In particular, we emphasize
that a phase space measure should be defined by means of the Jacobian of the
transformation between different types of coordinates since such a determinant
is different from zero in the non-canonical case even if the phase space
compressibility is null. Instead, the Jacobian determinant associated with
phase space flows is unity whenever non-canonical coordinates lead to a
vanishing compressibility, so that its use in order to define a measure may not
be always correct. To better illustrate this point, we derive a mathematical
condition for defining non-Hamiltonian phase space flows with zero
compressibility. The Jacobian determinant associated with time evolution in
phase space is altogether useful for analyzing time translation invariance. The
proper definition of a phase space measure is particularly important when
defining the entropy functional in the canonical, non-canonical, and
non-Hamiltonian cases. We show how the use of relative entropies can circumvent
some subtle problems that are encountered when dealing with continuous
probability distributions and phase space measures. Finally, a maximum
(relative) entropy principle is formulated for non-canonical and
non-Hamiltonian phase space flows.

formulation. For weak coupling to a chaotic cavity with a sufficiently dense
spectrum, the ensuing complex structure of resonances and antiresonances leads
to phase randomization under coarse graining in energy. Such phase
instabilities and coarse graining are the ingredients for a mechanism producing
decoherence and thus irreversibility. For the present simple model one finds a

of the in-plane transport experiments relates the substrate-induced strain in

latest developments in network architectures, such as peer-to-peer networks,
sensor networks, ad-hoc wireless networks, and overlay networks. A common
characteristic among all of these new technologies is the presence of highly
dynamic network topologies. Currently deployed single-path routing protocols
cannot adequately cope with this dynamism, and existing multi-path algorithms
make trade-offs which lead to less than optimal performance on these networks.
This drives the need for routing protocols designed with the unique
characteristics of these networks in mind.
  In this paper we propose the notion of reachability routing as a solution to
the challenges posed by routing on such dynamic networks. In particular, our
formulation of reachability routing provides cost-sensitive multi-path
forwarding along with loop avoidance within the confines of the Internet
Protocol (IP) architecture. This is achieved through the application of
reinforcement learning within a probabilistic routing framework. Following an
explanation of our design decisions and a description of the algorithm, we
provide an evaluation of the performance of the algorithm on a variety of
network topologies. The results show consistently superior performance compared
to other reinforcement learning based routing algorithms.

P(D) under the stable model semantics. Without decisiveness, the result holds

we need to use the Kunen semantics of P(D), instead.

redundancy of C is defined as the minimum number of rows in a parity-check
matrix for C such that the smallest stopping sets in the corresponding Tanner
graph have size d. We derive new upper bounds on the stopping redundancy of
linear codes in general, and of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes
specifically, and show how they improve upon previously known results. For MDS
codes, the new bounds are found by upper bounding the stopping redundancy by a
combinatorial quantity closely related to Turan numbers. (The Turan number,
T(v,k,t), is the smallest number of t-subsets of a v-set, such that every
k-subset of the v-set contains at least one of the t-subsets.) We further show
that the stopping redundancy of MDS codes is T(n,d-1,d-2)(1+O(n^{-1})) for
fixed d, and is at most T(n,d-1,d-2)(3+O(n^{-1})) for fixed code dimension
k=n-d+1. For d=3,4, we prove that the stopping redundancy of MDS codes is equal
to T(n,d-1,d-2), for which exact formulas are known. For d=5, we show that the

adding combinations of constraints to the right-hand-side of ADM and/or by
linear transformation of the dynamical ADM variables depends entirely on the

inclusive B decays. Such corrections are allowed by the OPE, but have largely
escaped attention so far. The related four-quark `double heavy' expectation
values of the form <B|\bar{b}c \bar{c}b|B> are computed in the 1/m_c expansion
by integrating out the charm field to one and two loops. A significant
enhancement of the two-loop coefficients has been noted. A method is suggested
for evaluating the expectation values of the higher-order b-quark operators
required to calculate charm expectation values, free from the overly large
ambiguities of dimensional analyses. The soft-charm effects were found
generally at the level of 0.5% in \Gamma_{sl}(b->c); however, as a result of
cancellations the net impact should be smaller. We propose a direct way to
search for such effects in the data. Finally, we discuss the relation of the
soft charm corrections in inclusive decays with the `Intrinsic Charm' ansatz.

Coulomb field incorporates a known difficulty, i.e. the total charge of the

the renormalizability of the Standard model, which presumes that at small
distances all physical quantities are well defined. The paradox is shown to be
resolved by the QED vacuum polarization, which brings in a strong effective
repulsion and eradicates the infinite charge of the boson on the Coulomb
center. The effect makes the Coulomb problem for vector bosons well defined and
consistent with the Standard Model.

covers a full Lebesgue (volume) measure subset of the topological basin of

particular, simulation scalability, is attracting a lot of attention due to the
importance of such lines in semiconductor manufacturing. Re-entrant flows lead
to competition for processing capacity among the items produced, which
significantly impacts their throughput time (TPT). Such production models
naturally exhibit two time scales: a short one, characteristic of single items
processed through individual machines, and a longer one, characteristic of the
response time of the entire factory. Coarse-grained partial differential
equations for the spatio-temporal evolution of a ""phase density"" were obtained
through a kinetic theory approach in Armbruster et al. [2]. We take advantage
of the time scale separation to directly solve such coarse-grained equations,
even when we cannot derive them explicitly, through an equation-free
computational approach. Short bursts of appropriately initialized stochastic
fine-scale simulation are used to perform coarse projective integration on the
phase density. The key step in this process is lifting: the construction of
fine-scale, discrete realizations consistent with a given coarse-grained phase
density field. We achieve this through computational evaluation of conditional
distributions of a ""phase velocity"" at the limit of large item influxes.

  ed., Milan: Polimetrica",,,,"math.CT math.LO",,"  The question ""What is category theory"" is approached by focusing on universal
mapping properties and adjoint functors. Category theory organizes mathematics
using morphisms that transmit structure and determination. Structures of
mathematical interest are usually characterized by some universal mapping
property so the general thesis is that category theory is about determination
through universals. In recent decades, the notion of adjoint functors has moved
to center-stage as category theory's primary tool to characterize what is
important and universal in mathematics. Hence our focus here is to present a
theory of adjoint functors, a theory which shows that all adjunctions arise
from the birepresentations of ""chimeras"" or ""heteromorphisms"" between the
objects of different categories. Since representations provide universal
mapping properties, this theory places adjoints within the framework of
determination through universals. The conclusion considers some unreasonably
effective analogies between these mathematical concepts and some central
philosophical themes.

studied under assumption that the nominal delay values are not equal to zero.

the bound of the $L_2$-norm of a certain integral operator. There exists a
bound on this operator in two cases: in the case where the delay derivative is
not greater than 1 and in the case without any constraints on the delay
derivative. In the present note we fill the gap between the two cases by
deriving an operator bound which is an increasing and continuous function of
the delay derivative upper bound $d \geq 1$. For $d\to \infty$ the new bound
corresponds to the second case and improves the existing bound. As a result,
improved frequency-domain and time-domain stability criteria are erived for

consisting of domain chaos close to the sample center, surrounded by an annulus
of nearly-stationary nearly-radial rolls populated by occasional defects
reminiscent of undulation chaos. Although the Coriolis force is responsible for
domain chaos, by comparing experiment and simulation we show that the
centrifugal force is responsible for the radial rolls. Furthermore, simulations
of the Boussinesq equations for smaller aspect ratios neglecting the
centrifugal force yielded a domain precession-frequency $f\sim\epsilon^\mu$
with $\mu\simeq1$ as predicted by the amplitude-equation model for domain
chaos, but contradicted by previous experiment. Additionally the simulations
gave a domain size that was larger than in the experiment. When the centrifugal
force was included in the simulation, $\mu$ and the domain size closely agreed
with experiment.

grows large enough, it is shown that the turbulence may actively prevent
further reconnection. This is qualitatively similar to experimentally observed

of Colors as his greatest and ultimate achievement. Its reception following
publication in 1810 and subsequent reviews throughout the history of physical
science did not reflect this self-assessment. Even Hermann von Helmholtz, who
in part modeled his scientific work after Goethe's, initially thought that
Goethe's poetic genius prevented him from understanding physical science. Why
did Goethe champion his Farbenlehre so ardently even years after it was
dismissed by almost everyone else? In answering this question, this essay will
attempt to add to the existing scholarship by considering Goethe's Theory of
Colors in the context of his natural philosophy, and generalizing the variety
of objectifications of the concepts invoked by his color theory and their
relationships to Goethe's epistemology and Newton's mechanics. In this fashion,
I attempt to show that the reason for Goethe's self-assessment of his Theory of
Colors is less enigmatic than appears from its examination solely as a work of
physics. Rather, Zur Farbenlehre was the clearest expression of Goethe's most
universal archetype-- polarity of opposites-- which bridged Goethe's conflicts
with Kant's and Spinoza's epistemologies, and in an over-reaching way served as
a cosmology underlying Goethe's art and his science.

(M1-t-p53) of myeloid leukemic cells, we have analyzed the expression of genes
that are preferentially expressed in different normal tissues. Clustering of
547 highly expressed genes in these leukemic cells showed 38 genes
preferentially expressed in normal hematopoietic tissues and 122 other genes
preferentially expressed in different normal non-hematopoietic tissues
including neuronal tissues, muscle, liver and testis. We have also analyzed the
genes whose expression in the leukemic cells changed after activation of
wild-type p53 and treatment with the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) or the
calcium mobilizer thapsigargin (TG). Out of 620 such genes in the leukemic
cells that were differentially expressed in normal tissues, clustering showed
80 genes that were preferentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues and 132
genes in different normal non-hematopietic tissues that also included neuronal
tissues, muscle, liver and testis. Activation of p53 and treatment with IL-6 or
TG induced different changes in the genes preferentially expressed in these
normal tissues. These myeloid leukemic cells thus express genes that are
expressed in normal non-hematopoietic tissues, and various treatments can
reprogram these cells to induce other such non-hematopoietic genes. The results
indicate that these leukemic cells share with normal hematopoietic stem cells
the plasticity of differentiation to different cell types. It is suggested that
this reprogramming to induce in malignant cells genes that are expressed in
different normal tissues may be of clinical value in therapy.

normal human tissues, human cancer cell lines and leukemic cells from lymphoid
and myeloid leukemia pediatric patients. We have searched for genes that are
over expressed in human cancer and also show specific patterns of
tissue-dependent expression in normal tissues. Using the expression data of the
normal tissues we identified 4346 genes with a high variability of expression,
and clustered these genes according to their relative expression level. Of 91
stable clusters obtained, 24 clusters included genes preferentially expressed
either only in hematopoietic tissues or in hematopoietic and 1-2 other tissues;
28 clusters included genes preferentially expressed in various
non-hematopoietic tissues such as neuronal, testis, liver, kidney, muscle,
lung, pancreas and placenta. Analysis of the expression levels of these 2
groups of genes in the human cancer cell lines and leukemias, identified genes
that were highly expressed in cancer cells but not in their normal
counterparts, and were thus over expressed in the cancers. The different cancer
cell lines and leukemias varied in the number and identity of these over
expressed genes. The results indicate that many genes that are over expressed
in human cancer cells are specific to a variety of normal tissues, including
normal tissues other than those from which the cancer originated. It is
suggested that this general property of cancer cells plays a major role in
determining the behavior of the cancers, including their metastatic potential.

a major challenge for systems biology. Here we analyzed genome-wide
transcription profiling of an in-vitro transformation process. We focused on a
cluster of genes whose expression levels increased as a function of p53 and
p16INK4A tumor suppressors inactivation. This cluster predominantly consists of
cell cycle genes and constitutes a signature of a diversity of cancers. By
linking expression profiles of the genes in the cluster with the dynamic
behavior of p53 and p16INK4A, we identified a promoter architecture that
integrates signals from the two tumor suppressive channels and that maps their
activity onto distinct levels of expression of the cell cycle genes, which in
turn, correspond to different cellular proliferation rates. Taking components
of the mitotic spindle as an example, we experimentally verified our
predictions that p53-mediated transcriptional repression of several of these
novel targets is dependent on the activities of p21, NFY and E2F. Our study
demonstrates how a well-controlled transformation process allows linking
between gene expression, promoter architecture and activity of upstream
signaling molecules.

two dimensions, in three dimensions it is necessary to add a curvature term in
the Lagrangian in order that the quantum motion can be properly defined. Once
this is done, it turns out that in the two three-dimensional Darboux spaces,
which are discussed in this paper, the quantum motion is similar to the
two-dimensional case. In $\threedDI$ we find seven coordinate systems which
separate the Schr\""odinger equation. For the second space, $\threedDII$, all
coordinate systems of flat three-dimensional Euclidean space which separate the
Schr\""odinger equation also separate the Schr\""odinger equation in
$\threedDII$. I solve the path integral on $\threedDI$ in the $(u,v,w)$-system,
and on $\threedDII$ in the $(u,v,w)$-system and in spherical coordinates.

quantum mechanics but not in classical mechanics, forces a change in
statistics. The answer, illustrated with simple examples, is that the
equilibrium measure on classical phase space is continuous, whilst on Hilbert
space it is discrete. The relevance of names, or equivalently, properties
stable in time that can be used as names, is also discussed.

We demonstrate in the context of quantum optics how stability of quantum

Quantum feedback networks are shown to be stable if the loop gain is less than
one-this is an extension of the famous small gain theorem of classical control
theory. We illustrate the simplicity and power of the small gain approach with
applications to important problems of robust stability and robust
stabilization.

the adiabatic approximation for this class of systems. In this article we
explore the origin of these observations by a perturbative approach and find
that in first order approximation certain nonzero terms appear in the solution
which gives rise to the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation (despite the
fact that the traditional adiabatic conditions are satisfied). We argue that in
this case the Hamiltonian of Marzlin and Sanders' inverse time evolving system
cannot be written in terms of t/T, where T denotes the total evolution time. It
is further demonstrated that the new qualitative adiabatic condition of Ye et
al. (2005) performs well in some cases when the traditional conditions fail to
describe properly non-adiabatic evolution.
