significant population of broad line, z~2 QSOs which have heavily absorbed
X-ray spectra. These objects have luminosities and redshifts characteristic of
the sources that produce the bulk of the QSO luminosity in the universe. Our
follow up observations in the submillimetre show that these QSOs are embedded
in ultraluminous starburst galaxies, unlike most unabsorbed QSOs at the same
redshifts and luminosities. The radically different star formation properties
between the absorbed and unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption is
unrelated to the torus invoked in AGN unification schemes. The most puzzling
question about these objects is the nature of the X-ray absorber. We present
our study of the X-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) XMM-Newton
spectroscopy. The hypothesis of a normal QSO continuum, coupled with a neutral
absorber is strongly rejected. We consider the alternative hypotheses for the
absorber, originating either in the QSO or in the surrounding starburst.
Finally we discuss the implications for QSO/host galaxy formation, in terms of
an evolutionary sequence of star formation and black hole growth. We propose
that both processes occur simultaneously in the gas-and-dust-rich heavily
obscured centres of young galaxies, and that absorbed QSOs form a transitional
stage, between the main obscured growth phase, and the luminous QSO.

two phases: a phase with log ionisation parameter xi of 0.50 (where xi is in
units of ergs cm/s) and a column of 0.2e21 cm^-2, and a phase with log xi of
1.62 and a column of 1.3e22 cm^-2. An iron K alpha line is detected. Neutral
absorption is also present in the source, and we discuss possible origins for
this. On the assumption that the ionised absorbers originate as an outflow from
the inner edge of the torus, we use a new method for finding the volume filling
factor. Both phases of H0557-385 have small volume filling factors (< 1%). We
also derive the volume filling factors for a sample of 23 AGN using this
assumption and for the absorbers with log xi > 0.7 we find reasonable agreement
with the filling factors obtained through the alternative method of equating
the momentum flow of the absorbers to the momentum loss of the radiation field.
By comparing the filling factors obtained by the two methods, we infer that
some absorbers with log xi < 0.7 occur at significantly larger distances from
the nucleus than the inner edge of the torus.

internal shocks. Such a crisis may be avoided if a weak relativistic explosion
occurs ~10^3-10^6 s prior to the main burst or if the microphysical parameter
of the electron energy increases during the shallow decay, \epsilon_e ~
t^{1/2}. The former explanation predicts a very long precursor, while both
prefer dim optical flashes from the reverse shock, as was recently reported. We
also calculate the multi-wavelength afterglows and compare them with
observations. No optical break at the end of the shallow X-ray decay indicates
a preference for the time-dependent microphysics model with additionally
decaying magnetic fields, \epsilon_B ~ t^{-0.6}.

the Galactic value. A few studies based on BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton found
evidence of higher than Galactic values for the column density in a number of

early decays (F(t)\propto t^{-3}), breaking to flatter slopes on timescales of
a few hundred seconds. For GRB050126 the burst shows no evidence of spectral
evolution in the 20-150 keV band, and the spectral index of the gamma-ray and
X-ray afterglows are significantly different suggesting a separate origin. By
contrast the BAT spectrum of GRB050219A displays significant spectral
evolution, becoming softer at later times, with Gamma evolving toward the XRT
photon index seen in the early X-ray afterglow phase. For both bursts, the
0.2-10 keV spectral index pre- and post-break in the X-ray decay light-curve

equations, pushing slowly the evolution toward the space of solutions of the

additive and multiplicative antipodal convolutions which fail to give rise to
Hopf algebra structures, obeying only a weakened (multiplicative) homomorphism
axiom. The consequences of the weakened structure, called a Hopf gebra, e.g. on
cohomology are explored. This features multiplicativity versus complete
multiplicativity of number theoretic arithmetic functions. The deficiency of
not being a Hopf algebra is then cured by introducing an `unrenormalized'
coproduct and an `unrenormalized' pairing. It is then argued that exactly the
failure of the homomorphism property (complete multiplicativity) for
non-coprime integers is a blueprint for the problems in quantum field theory
(QFT) leading to the need for renormalization. Renormalization turns out to be
the morphism from the algebraically sound Hopf algebra to the physical and
number theoretically meaningful Hopf gebra. This can be modelled alternatively
by employing Rota-Baxter operators. We stress the need for a
characteristic-free development where possible, to have a sound starting point
for generalizations of the algebraic structures. The last section provides
three key applications: symmetric function theory, quantum (matrix) mechanics,
and the combinatorics of renormalization in QFT which can be discerned as
functorially inherited from the development at the number-theoretic level as
outlined here. Hence the occurrence of number theoretic functions in QFT
becomes natural.

quasi-isometric to the three dimenionsional solvable Lie group Sol is virtually
a lattice in Sol. We prove analogous results for groups quasi-isometric to $R
\ltimes R^n$ where the semidirect product is defined by a diagonalizable matrix
of determinant one with no eigenvalues on the unit circle. Our approach to
these problems is to first classify all self quasi-isometries of the solvable
Lie group. Our classification of self quasi-isometries for $R \ltimes \R^n$
proves a conjecture made by Farb and Mosher in [FM4].
  Our techniques for studying quasi-isometries extend to some other classes of
groups and spaces. In particular, we characterize groups quasi-isometric to any
lamplighter group, answering a question of de la Harpe [dlH]. Also, we prove
that certain Diestel-Leader graphs are not quasi-isometric to any finitely
generated group, verifying a conjecture of Diestel and Leader from [DL] and
answering a question of Woess from [SW],[Wo1]. We also prove that certain
non-unimodular, non-hyperbolic solvable Lie groups are not quasi-isometric to
finitely generated groups.
  The results in this paper are contributions to Gromov's program for
classifying finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry [Gr2]. We introduce
a new technique for studying quasi-isometries, which we refer to as ""coarse
differentiation"".

regularity properties of their associated dynamical systems. The proof proceeds
in two steps. First, we characterize regular model sets in terms of a certain
map $\beta$ and then relate the properties of $\beta$ to ones of the underlying
dynamical system. As a by-product, we can show that regular model sets are, in
a suitable sense, as close to periodic sets as possible among repetitive
aperiodic sets.

""Complex Lorentzian Leech lattice and bimonster"".(Arxiv. math.GR/0508228). The
results and methods of proof are similar.
  We find 14 roots in the automorphism group of the the quaternionic Lorentzian
Leech lattice L that form the Coxeter diagram D given by the incidence graph of
projective plane over finite field of order 2. We prove that the reflections in
these 14 roots generate the automorphism group of L. We find evidence that
these reflections behave like the simple roots and the vector fixed by the
diagram automorphisms behaves like the Weyl vector for the reflection group.
Much of the work follows the analogy that D is like the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram
for this hyperbolic reflection group.

important role in modern mathematics were we consider various operations on

$n$-place functions is an $(n+1)$-ary superposition $[ ]$, but there are some
other naturally defined operations, which are also worth of consideration. In
this paper we consider binary Mann's compositions $\op{1},...,\op{n}$ for
partial $n$-place functions, which have many important applications for the
study of binary and $n$-ary operations. We present methods of representations
of such algebras by $n$-place functions and find an abstract characterization
of the set of $n$-place functions closed with respect to the set-theoretic
inclusion.

associative-commutative ring K with 1, i.e., the varieties in which free
algebras are graded. Let F be a free algebra of some variety A of linear
algebras over K freely generated by a finite set X, EndF be the semigroup of
endomorphisms of F, and AutEndF be the group of automorphisms of the semigroup
EndF. We investigate structure of the group AutEndF and its relation to the
algebraical and categorical equivalence of algebras from A.
  We define a wide class of R1MF-domains containing, in particular, Bezout
domains, unique factorization domains, and some other domains. We show that
every automorphism of semigroup EndF, where F is a free finitely generated Lie
algebra over an R1MF-domain, is semi-inner. This solves the Problem 5.1 left
open in [21]. As a corollary, semi-innerity of all automorphism of the category
of free Lie algebras over R1MF-domains is obtained. Relations between
categorical and geometrical equivalence of Lie algebras over R1MF-domains are
clarified.
  The group AutEndF for the variety of m-nilpotent associative algebras over
R1MF-domains is described. As a consequence, a complete description of the
group of automorphisms of the full matrix semigroup of n x n matrices over
R1MF-domains is obtained.
  We give an example of the variety of linear algebras over a Dedekind domain
such that not all automorphisms of AutEndF are quasi-inner.
  The results obtained generalize the previous studies of various special cases
of varieties of linear algebras over infinite fields.

semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (NCs) in proximity of metal and
semiconducting Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tips. The presence of the tip
alters the radiative decay rate of an emitter via interference and opens
efficient non radiative decay channels via energy transfer to the tip material.
These effects cause quenching (or enhancement) of the emitter's PL intensity,
as a function of its distance from the interacting tip. We take advantage of
this highly distance dependent effect to realize a contrast mechanism for high
resolution optical imaging. AFM tips are optimized as energy acceptors by
chemical functionalization with InAs NCs to achieve optical resolution down to
30 nm. The presented experimental scheme offers high resolution optical
information while maintaining the benefits of traditional AFM imaging. We
directly measure the PL intensity of single NCs as a function of the tip
distance. Our results are in good agreement to calculation made by a classical
theoretical model describing an oscillating dipole interacting with a planar
mirror.
