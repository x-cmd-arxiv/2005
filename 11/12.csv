mass of bright galaxies was already in place at $z>1$. This presents a
challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembled
late in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (CDM). In this paper,
we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model in which
feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows
in massive halos. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy
luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the
Millennium N-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and large
number of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulation
provides results in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of
the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of local
galaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and
galaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate the volume averaged star
formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in
which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model
robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift
$z\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasing
redshift in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these
properties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy
formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the
fundamentally hierachical CDM model provides a very good match to these
observations.

microHertz and some first harmonics of these. The amplitude of the pulsation is
modulated with the rotation period of the star that we determine with 2.91179
+/- 0.00007 d from the analysis of the stellar pulsation spectrum and of the
mean light data. We break the distorted oscillation mode up into its pure
spherical harmonic components and find it is dominated by the l=1 pulsation,

geometrical configuration of the star allows one to see both pulsation poles
for about the same amount of time; HD 99563 is only the fourth roAp star for
which both pulsation poles are seen and only the third where the distortion of
the pulsation modes was modelled. We point out that HD 99563 is very similar to
the well-studied roAp star HR 3831. Finally, we note that the visual companion
of HD 99563 is located in the Delta Scuti instability strip and may thus show
pulsation. We show that if the companion was physical, the roAp star would be a
2.03 solar mass object, seen at a rotational inclination of 44 degrees, which
then predicts a magnetic obliquity of 86.4 degrees.

We confirm that the mechanism of positive feedback of ionizing radiation on
star formation in mini-galaxies proposed by Ricotti, Gnedin, & Shull (2002) can
be efficient despite a significant flux of metagalactic photo-dissociating
radiation. We derive critical fluxes for the Lyman-Werner background radiation
sufficient to prevent the collapse of gas in mini-galaxies as a function of the
virial mass of the halo and redshift. In our model, the formation of
mini-galaxies in defunct HII regions is most efficient at large redshifts
(z>15) and/or for large local gas overdensity delta>10. We show that
non-equilibrium chemistry plays an important dynamical role not only during the
initial evolutionary phase leading to the gas becoming gravitationally unstable
inside the mini-halo, but also at the advanced stages of the core collapse,
resulting in efficient gas accretion in the core region. We speculate on a

dependence of star formation activity in pairs on orbital parameters and global
environment. We use the projected galaxy density derived from the fifth nearest
neighbour of each galaxy, with convenient luminosity thresholds to characterise
environment in both surveys in a consistent way. Star formation activity is
derived through the $\eta$ parameter in 2dFGRS and through the star formation
rate normalised to the total mass in stars, $SFR/M^*$, given by Brinchmann et
al. (2004) in the second data release SDSS-DR2. For both galaxy pair catalogs,
the star formation birth rate parameter is a strong function of the global
environment and orbital parameters. Our analysis on SDSS pairs confirms
previous results found with the 2dFGRS where suitable thresholds for the star
formation activity induced by interactions are estimated at a projected
distance $r_{\rm p} = 100 \kpc$ and a relative velocity $\Delta V = 350$ km
$s^{-1}$. We observe that galaxy interactions are more effective at triggering
important star formation activity in low and moderate density environments with
respect to the control sample of galaxies without a close companion. Although
close pairs have a larger fraction of actively star-forming galaxies, they also
exhibit a greater fraction of red galaxies with respect to those systems
without a close companion, an effect that may indicate that dust stirred up
during encounters could be affecting colours and, partially, obscuring
tidally-induced star formation.

clear hierarchy of morphologies: the mass in large-scale sheets is partitioned
up among lower mass filaments, which themselves are made-up of still lower mass
halos. Our approach provides analytic estimates of the mass fraction in sheets,
filaments and halos, and its evolution, for any background cosmological model
and any initial fluctuation spectrum. In the currently popular $\Lambda$CDM
model, our analysis suggests that more than 99% of the cosmic mass is in
sheets, and 72% in filaments, with mass larger than $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ at the
present time. For halos, this number is only 46%. Our approach also provides
analytic estimates of how halo abundances at any given time correlate with the
morphology of the surrounding large-scale structure, and how halo evolution
correlates with the morphology of large scale structure.

approximation, and assume that the black hole mass is sufficiently large
compared to that of the neutron star so that the black hole remains fixed in
space. Using a spheroidal spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting field
equations for a neutron star orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. The matter is
evolved using a relativistic, Lagrangian, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
treatment. We take as our initial data recent quasiequilibrium models for
synchronized neutron star polytropes generated as solutions of the conformal
thin-sandwich (CTS) decomposition of the Einstein field equations. We are able
to construct from these models relaxed SPH configurations whose profiles show
good agreement with CTS solutions. Our adiabatic evolution calculations for
neutron stars with low compactness show that mass transfer, when it begins
while the neutron star orbit is still outside the innermost stable circular
orbit, is more unstable than is typically predicted by analytical formalisms.
This dynamical mass loss is found to be the driving force in determining the
subsequent evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star, which typically
disrupts completely within a few orbital periods. The majority of the mass
transferred onto the black hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction
(~30%) of the mass is shed outward as well, some of which will become
gravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system. The remaining

the l=2 and l=1 modes, in which the former is strongest), are consistent with
all major observational features of SN 1987A, in contrast to models which show
high-order mode perturbations only and were published in earlier work. Among
other items, the low-mode models exhibit final iron-group velocities of up to
3300 km/s, strong mixing at the He/H composition interface, with hydrogen being
mixed downward in velocity space to only 500 km/s, and a final prolate
anisotropy of the ejecta with a major to minor axis ratio of about 1.6. The
success of low-mode explosions with an energy of about 2x10**51 erg to
reproduce these observed features is based on two effects: the (by 40%) larger
initial maximum velocities of metal-rich clumps compared to our high-mode
models, and the initial global deformation of the shock. The latter triggers
the growth of a strong Richtmyer-Meshkov instability at the He/H interface that
results in a global anisotropy of the inner ejecta at late times (i.e. t >
10000 s), although the shock itself has long become spherical by then. The
simulations suggest a coherent picture, which explains the observational data
of SN 1987A within the framework of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism
using a minimal set of assumptions. It is therefore argued that other
paradigms, which are based on (more) controversial physics, may not be required

sub-km asteroids from an orbit within the asteroid Main Belt. The main purpose
of the proposed Bering mission is to detect a statistically significant sample
of an expected population of approximately 10^(10) main belt asteroids in the
size range 1 m to 1 km. These asteroids are too faint to be observed using
Earth-based telescopes. Sub-km asteroids can be detected from spacecraft at
close range but due to the high relative velocities and the long communication
times this requires a fully autonomous spacecraft. Using theoretical estimates
of the distribution and abundance of sub-km asteroids we find that the Bering
mission would detect approximately 6 new sub-km asteroids per day. With an
expected lifetime for the mission of a few years we expect to detect and study
several thousand sub-km asteroids. Results from the Bering mission would allow
us to: 1) Provide further links between groups of meteorites and their parent
asteroids. 2) Constrain the cratering rate at planetary surfaces and thus allow
significantly improved cratering ages for terrains on Mars and other planets.
3) Constrain processes that transfer small asteroids from orbits in the main
belt to the inner Solar System.

profiles of infrared phonon bands of solid dust grains. Calculating these
effects is difficult due to the often extreme refractive index values in these
bands. In this paper, we use the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) and the
T-matrix method to compute the absorption band profiles for simple clusters of
touching spherical grains. We invest reasonable amounts of computation time in
order to reach high dipole grid resolutions and take high multi-polar orders
into account, respectively. The infrared phonon bands of three different
refractory materials of astrophysical relevance are considered - Silicon
Carbide (SiC), Wustite (FeO) and Silicon Dioxide (SiO2). We demonstrate that
even though these materials display a range of material properties and
therefore different strengths of the surface resonances, a complete convergence
is obtained with none of the approaches. For the DDA, we find a strong
dependence of the calculated band profiles on the exact dipole distribution
within the aggregates, especially in the vicinity of the contact points between
their spherical constituents. By applying a recently developed method to
separate the material optical constants from the geometrical parameters in the
DDA approach, we are able to demonstrate that the most critical material
properties are those where the real part of the refractive index is much
smaller than unity.

dynamic objects through which mass is transported and accreted by the central
star. Age dating of meteorite constituents shows that their creation,
evolution, and accumulation occupied several Myr, and over this time disk
properties would evolve significantly. Moreover, on this timescale, solid
particles decouple from the gas in the disk and their evolution follows a
different path. Here we present a model which tracks how the distribution of
water changes in an evolving disk as the water-bearing species experience
condensation, accretion, transport, collisional destruction, and vaporization.
Because solids are transported in a disk at different rates depending on their
sizes, the motions will lead to water being concentrated in some regions of a
disk and depleted in others. These enhancements and depletions are consistent
with the conditions needed to explain some aspects of the chemistry of
chondritic meteorites and formation of giant planets. The levels of
concentration and depletion, as well as their locations, depend strongly on the
combined effects of the gaseous disk evolution, the formation of rapidly
migrating rubble, and the growth of immobile planetesimals. We present examples
of evolution under a range of plausible assumptions and demonstrate how the
chemical evolution of the inner region of a protoplanetary disk is intimately

theory in its local density approximation (LDA), incorporates electronic
correlations only very rudimentarily and fails if the correlations are strong.
Encouraged by the success of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) in dealing with
strongly correlated model Hamiltonians, physicists from the bandstructure and
the many-body community have joined forces and developed a combined LDA+DMFT
method recently. Depending on the strength of electronic correlations, this new
approach yields a weakly correlated metal as in LDA, a strongly correlated
metal, or a Mott insulator. By now, this approach is widely regarded as a
breakthrough for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated
materials.
  The author will review this LDA+DMFT method and also discuss alternative
approaches to employ DMFT in electronic structure calculations, for example, by
replacing the LDA part by the so-called GW approximation. Different methods to
solve the DMFT equations are introduced with a focus on those that are suitable
for realistic calculations with many orbitals. An overview of the successful
application of LDA+DMFT to a wide variety of materials, ranging from Pu and Ce,
to Fe and Ni, to numerous transition metal oxides, is given.

Weierstrass function of the Einstein's equations (see gr-qc/0105022),the
present paper develops further the proposed approach in hep-th/0107231,
concerning the s.c. cubic algebraic equation for effective parametrization.
Obtaining an ''embedded'' sequence of cubic equations, it is shown that it is
possible to parametrize also a multi-variable cubic curve, which is not the
standardly known case from algebraic geometry. Algebraic solutions for the
contravariant metric tensor components are derived and the parametrization is
extended in respect to the covariant components as well. It has been speculated
that corrections to the extradimensional volume in theories with extra
dimensions should be taken into account, due to the non-euclidean nature of the
Lobachevsky space. It was shown that the mechanism of exponential ""damping"" of
the physical mass in the higher-dimensional brane theory may be more
complicated due to the variety of contravariant metric components for a
spacetime with a given constant curvature. The invariance of the low-energy
type I string theory effective action is considered in respect not only to the
known procedure of compactification to a four-dimensional spacetime, but also
in respect to rescaling the contravariant metric components. As a result,
instead of the simple algebraic relations between the parameters in the string
action, quasilinear differential equations in partial derivatives are obtained,
which have been solved for the most simple case. In the Appendix, a new block
structure method is presented for solving the well known system of operator
equations in gravity theory in the N-dimensional case.

lower bounds for the multiplicity of a Cohen-Macaulay algebra $A$ in terms of
the shifts appearing in the modules of the minimal free resolution (MFR) of
$A$. All the examples studied so far have lead to conjecture (see $[HZ]$ and
$[MNR2]$) that, moreover, the bounds of the MC are sharp if and only if $A$ has
a pure MFR. Therefore, it seems a reasonable - and useful - idea to seek
better, if possibly {\it ad hoc}, bounds for particular classes of
Cohen-Macaulay algebras. In this work we will only consider the codimension 3
case. In the first part we will stick to the bounds of the MC, and show that
they hold for those algebras whose $h$-vector is that of a compressed algebra.
In the second part, we will (mainly) focus on the level case: we will construct
new conjectural upper and lower bounds for the multiplicity of a codimension 3
level algebra $A$, which can be expressed exclusively in terms of the
$h$-vector of $A$, and which are better than (or equal to) those provided by
the MC. Also, our bounds can be sharp even when the MFR of $A$ is not pure.
Even though proving our bounds still appears too difficult a task in general,
we are already able to show them for some interesting classes of codimension 3
level algebras $A$: namely, when $A$ is compressed, or when its $h$-vector
$h(A)$ ends with $(...,3,2)$. Also, we will prove our lower bound when $h(A)$
begins with $(1,3,h_2,...)$, where $h_2\leq 4$, and our upper bound when $h(A)$
ends with $(...,h_{c-1},h_c)$, where $h_{c-1}\leq h_c+1$.

stable domination coincides with a natural notion of `orthogonality to the
value group'. We also investigate other notions of independence, and show that
they all agree, and are well-behaved, for stably dominated types. One of these
is used to show that every type extends to an invariant type; definable types
are dense. Much of this work requires the use of imaginary elements. We also
show existence of prime models over reasonable bases, possibly including

manifolds, we show how the $k$-form operators $Q_k$ of \cite{ddd}, which
generalise the Q-curvature, retain a key aspect of the $Q$-curvature's relation
to the Pfaffian, by obstructing certain representations of natural operators on
closed forms. In a closely related direction, we show that the $Q_k$ give rise
to conformally invariant quadratic forms $\Theta_k$ on cohomology that
interpolate, in a suitable sense, between the integrated metric pairing (at
$k=n/2$) and the Pfaffian (at $k=0$). Using a different construction, we show
that the $Q_k$ operators yield a generalisation of the period map which maps
conformal structures to Lagrangian subspaces of the direct sum $H^k\oplus H_k$
(where $H_k$ is the dual of the de Rham cohomology space $H^k$). We couple the
$Q_k$ operators with the Pontrjagin forms to construct new natural densities
that have many properties in common with the original Q-curvature; in
particular these integrate to global conformal invariants. We also work out a
relevant example, and show that the proof of the invariance of the (nonlinear)
action functional whose critical metrics have constant Q-curvature extends to
the action functionals for these new Q-like objects. Finally we set up
eigenvalue problems that generalise to $Q_k$-operators the Q-curvature

  First, all C^2 volume preserving weakly hyperbolic actions on closed

ergodicity of Anosov diffeomorphisms to the wider class of weakly hyperbolic
group actions.
  To state the second main result, suppose that A denotes a weakly hyperbolic
action of a higher rank lattice (such as SL(n,Z) for n>2) by C^2 volume
preserving diffeomorphisms on the torus. If A is covered by an action of the
universal covering space, R^n, of the torus, then A induces a weakly hyperbolic
representation on the first homology of the torus. This result may be viewed as
an analogue of Manning's contribution to the Franks/Manning classification of
Anosov diffeos. on tori. We draw conclusions related to Zimmer's program of
classifying ergodic volume preserving actions of higher rank lattices.

is sufficient for an almost complete dynamical transfer of the entanglement.

macroscopic behaviours of composite finite dimensional systems coupled to
bosonic fields (like atomic clouds interacting with light). Furthermore, we
present a protocol based on sequential interactions of the CV system with some
ancillary qubit systems and on subsequent measurements, allowing to
probabilistically convert CV entanglement into `almost perfect' Bell pairs of
two qubits. Our proposals are suited for realizations in various experimental
