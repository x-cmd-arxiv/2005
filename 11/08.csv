scattering expanding rings around gamma-ray bursts, using as an example
XMM-Newton data of GRB 031203. Consistent with previous reports (Vaughan et al.
2004), we find that the two expanding rings observed in this burst are due to
dust unevenly distributed in two layers at distances of 870 and 1384 pc, with
the more distant one responsible for 70% of the total optical depth. Our
modelling of the rings indicates that the prompt X-ray emission of GRB 031203
was consistent with a power law spectrum with photon index $\Gamma$=2.1$\pm$0.2
and 1-2 keV fluence of (3.6$\pm$0.2)$\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$. Thanks to
the sensitivity of our technique, we discovered an expanding ring around
another burst recently observed with XMM-Newton, GRB 050713A. In this case the
dust layer is located at a distance of 364 pc and we derive a GRB fluence of
(1.2$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (1-2 keV). A search for similar
halos in other twelve bursts observed with XMM-Newton gave negative results.

redshift galaxies show complex velocity structures that are sensitive to the
details of the mass distribution within the cluster, in particular at small
scales. From fits to the simulated imaging and kinematic data we demonstrate
that reconstruction of the source velocity field is in principle feasible: two
dimensional kinematic information obtained with Integral Field Units (IFU's) on
large ground based telescopes in combination with adaptive optics will allow
the reconstruction of rotation curves of lensed high redshift galaxies. This
makes it possible to determine the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies at

positron annihilation line at 511 keV is in fact observed) only about 10%. It
is argued that a large fraction of the disk positrons may be transported via
the regular magnetic field of the Galaxy into the bulge, where they annihilate.
This would increase both the bulge emissivity and the bulge/disk ratio,
alleviating considerably the constraints imposed by INTEGRAL data analysis. We
argue that the bulge/disk positron emissivity ratio can be considerably smaller
than the values derived by the recent analysis of Knoedlseder et al. (2005), if
the disk positrons diffuse sufficiently away from their sources, as required by
our model; this possibility could be tested in the future, as data are
accumulated in the SPI detectors. The success of the proposed scenario depends
critically upon the, very poorly known at present, properties of the galactic
magnetic field and of the propagation of low energy positrons in it.

stellar winds. In particular, for late-type stars, some authors have proposed a
wind model driven by an outward-directed flux of damped Alfven waves. The winds
of these stars present great amounts of dust particles that, if charged, can
give rise to new wave modes or modify the pre-existing ones. In this work, we
study how the dust can affect the propagation of Alfven waves in these winds
taking into account a specific damping mechanism, dust-cyclotron damping. This
damping affects the Alfven wave propagation near the dust-cyclotron frequency.
Hence, if we assume a dust size distribution, the damping occurs over a broad
band of wave frequencies. In this work, we present a model of Alfven
wave-driven winds using the dust-cyclotron damping mechanism. On the basis of
coronal holes in the Sun, which present a superradial expansion, our model also
assumes a diverging geometry for the magnetic field. Thus, the mass, momentum,
and energy equations are obtained and then solved in a self-consistent
approach. Our results of wind velocity and temperature profiles for a typical
K5 supergiant star shows compatibility with observations. We also show that,
considering the presence of charged dust particles, the wave flux is less
damped due to the dust-cyclotron damping than it would be if we consider some
other damping mechanisms studied in the literature, such as nonlinear damping,
resonant surface damping, and turbulent damping.

binaries have companions with very similar masses, q=M_2/M_1 > 0.87, where M_1,
M_2 denote the masses of the two binary components, M_1 > M_2. A Salpeter
relative mass function for the secondary is very strongly excluded, and the
data is consistent with a flat mass function containing 55% of the systems and
a ``twin'' population with q>0.95 containing the remainder. We also survey the
vast existing literature discussing the mass ratio in binaries and conclude
that a significant twin population (of more than 20-25%) exists in binaries
that are likely to interact across a broad range of stellar masses and
metallicity. Interactions involving nearly equal mass stars have distinctly
different properties than those involving stars of unequal mass; the
secondaries will tend to be evolved and the common envelope evolution is
qualitatively different. The implications of such a population for both binary
interactions and star formation are substantial, and we present some examples.
We argue that twin systems may provide a natural stellar population to explain
the recently proposed prompt channel for type Ia SN, and the presence of a twin
population dramatically reduces the maximum inferred NS+BH merger rate relative
to the NS+NS merger rate. Twins may also be important for understanding the
tendency of WD and NS binaries to be nearly equal in mass, and inclusion of
twins in population studies will boost the blue straggler production rate.

of the so called ``p-process'' nuclei from A = 92 to 126. Both the lighter and
heavier p-process nuclei are adequately produced in the neon and oxygen shells
of ordinary Type II supernovae, but the origin of these intermediate isotopes,
especially 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru, has long been mysterious. Here we explore the
production of these nuclei in the neutrino-driven wind from a young neutron
star. We consider such early times that the wind still contains a proton excess
because the rates for electron neutrino and positron captures on neutrons are
faster than those for the inverse captures on protons. Following a suggestion
by Frohlich et al. 2005, we also include the possibility that, in addition to
the protons, alpha-particles, and heavy seed, a small flux of neutrons is
maintained by the reaction p(bar(nu_e),e+)n. This flux of neutrons is critical
in bridging the long waiting points along the path of the rp-process by (n,p)
and (n,gamma) reactions. Using the unmodified ejecta histories from a recent
two-dimensional supernova model by Janka et al. 2003, we find synthesis of
p-rich nuclei up to 102Pd. However, if the entropy of these ejecta is increased
by a factor of two, the synthesis extends to 120Te. Still larger increases in
entropy, that might reflect the role of magnetic fields or vibrational energy
input neglected in the hydrodynamical model, result in the production of
numerous r-, s-, and p-process nuclei up to A approximately 170, even in winds
that are proton-rich.

intrinsic attenuation by dust. We validate our approach using model high-pass
spectra of galaxies with different SF histories covering the wavelength range
3650-8500 A at a resolving power of about 2000. We show that the method can
recover the full SF histories of these models, without prior knowledge of the
metallicity, to within an accuracy that depends sensitively on signal-to-noise
ratio. The investigation of the sensitivity of the flux at each wavelength to
the mass fraction of stars of different ages allows us to identify new
age-sensitive features in galaxy spectra. We also highlight a fundamental
limitation in the recovery of the SF histories of galaxies for which the
optical signatures of intermediate-age stars are masked by those of younger and

highest-quality spectra of morphologically identified early- and late-type
galaxies in the SDSS EDR [...]. We also investigate the constraints set by the
high-pass signal in the stacked spectra of a magnitude-limited sample of
SDSS-EDR galaxies on the global SF history of the Universe. We confirm that the
stellar populations in the most massive galaxies today appear to have formed on
average earlier than those in the least massive ones. Our results do not
support the recent suggestion of a statistically significant peak in the SF
activity of the Universe at redshifts below unity, although such a peak is not

  press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Astronomical polarimetry is a powerful technique that can provide physical
information sometimes difficult or impossible to obtain by any other type of
observation. Almost every class of binary star can benefit from polarimetric
observations: pre-main-sequence objects, close or contact binaries,
mass-transfer systems, evolved binaries, cataclysmic variables, eclipsing
binaries, etc. In these systems, polarimetry can help determine the geometry of
the circumstellar or circumbinary matter distribution, yield information on
asymmetries and anisotropies, identify obscured sources, map starspots, detect
magnetic fields, and establish orbital parameters, to name just a few examples.
The orbital inclination in particular is a very important piece of information
for a binary system because it can lead to the determination of the components'
masses, the fundamental parameter that determines a star's initial structure
and subsequent evolution. This review will illustrate the usefulness of
polarimetric techniques for the study of binary stars, with examples of results
obtained for a variety of binary systems, and an overview of models, including
those used to retrieve the orbital inclination.

25 deg. square of the LMC obtained with the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST). The
depth of the high resolution map was extended to Requiv~22 for H-alpha (4.5 x

a dozen 2-hour H-alpha exposures. The resulting map is at least 1-magnitude
deeper than the best wide-field narrow-band LMC images currently available.
This depth, combined with our selection technique, has also led to the
discovery of extended AGB halos around many new and previously known LMC PNe
for the first time. Once complete, our new survey is expected to triple the LMC
PN population and have significant implications for the LMC PN luminosity
function, kinematics, abundance gradients chemical evolution and, via study of
the AGB halos, the initial to final mass relation for low to intermediate mass

break-up of planetesimals that are trapped in resonance with a planet. There
are three grain populations with different spatial distributions: (I) large
grains have the clumpy resonant distribution of the planetesimals; (II)
moderate sized grains are no longer in resonance and have an axisymmetric
distribution; (III) small grains are blown out of the system by radiation
pressure and have a distribution which falls off oc 1/r, however these grains
can be further divided into subclasses: (IIIa) grains produced from pop I that
exhibit trailing spiral structure emanating from the clumps; and (IIIb) grains
produced from pop II that have an axisymmetric distribution. Since observations
in different wavebands are sensitive to different sized dust grains,
multi-wavelength imaging can be used to test models for the origin of debris
disk structure. For example, a disk with no blow-out grains would appear clumpy
in the sub-mm, but smooth at mid- to far-IR wavelengths. The wavelength of the
transition is indicative of the mass of the perturbing planet. The size
distribution of Vega's disk is modeled in the light of the recent Spitzer
observations. The origin of the large quantities of pop III grains seen by
Spitzer must be in the destruction of the grains seen in the sub-mm, and so at
high resolution and sensitivity the mid- to far-IR structure of Vega's disk is
predicted to include spiral structure emanating from the sub-mm clumps.

stars. In this paper, we investigate the influence of atmospheric turbulence on
the performance of ground-based nulling instruments, and deduce the major
design guidelines for such instruments. End-to-end numerical simulations allow
us to estimate the performance of the main subsystems and thereby the actual
sensitivity of the nuller to faint exozodiacal disks. Particular attention is
also given to the important question of stellar leakage calibration. This study
is illustrated in the context of GENIE, the Ground-based European Nulling
Interferometer Experiment, to be installed at the VLTI and working in the L'
band. We estimate that this instrument will detect exozodiacal clouds as faint
as about 50 times the Solar zodiacal cloud, thereby placing strong constraints
on the acceptable targets for Darwin/TPF-I.

dependence of the dielectric constant. Yet, experiments have shown that at
ultralow temperatures $T<5mK$ such a temperature behavior breaks down and the
dielectric constant becomes temperature independent (plateau effect). In this

factor of the nuclear quadrupole ground states in the left and right potential

  Further developments in arxiv:0708.3518",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  Ernst Mach (1838-1916) suggested that the origin of gravitational interaction
could depend on the presence of all masses in the universe. A corresponding
hypothesis of Sciama (1953) on the gravitational constant, c^2/G = \sum
m_i/r_i, is linked to Dicke's (1957) proposal of an electromagnetic origin of
gravitation, a precursor of scalar-tensor-theories. In this an equivalent
description in terms of a variable speed of light (VSL) is given, and the
agreement with the four classical tests of general relativity is shown.
Moreover, VSL opens the possibility to write the total energy of a particle as
E=mc^2; this necessarily leads to the proportionality of inertial and
gravitating mass, the equivalence principle. Furthermore, a formula for c
depending on the mass distribution is given that reproduces Newton's law of
gravitation. This mass distribution allows to calculate a slightly variable
term that corresponds to the `constant' G. The present proposal may also supply
an alternative explanation to the flatness problem and the horizon problem in
cosmology.

  G.W.Gibbons, E.P.S.Shellard and S.J.Rankin (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2003)",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The canonical approach to Riemannian quantum gravity is reviewed with
reference to local supersymmetry, to the classical boundary-value problem
arising from the Hartle-Hawking quantum state, and particularly for
(anti-)self-dual geometries. Two examples of the boundary-value problem for the
Einstein equations, possibly with a cosmological constant \Lambda, are treated,
both of Bianchi-IX type. These close smoothly in the interior with a NUT or a
BOLT. The Hamiltonian approach to general relativity is described using
Ashtekar variables; for non-zero \Lambda and anti-self-dual Weyl tensor, the
classical solution corresponds, with the most naive choice of boundary data, to
the Chern-Simons functional of the boundary data, the classical action being
I_{CS}. Hence, one is led to the corresponding quantum states exp(\pm I_{CS}).
Apparently, the classical solutions have the undesirable feature that, in
general, the resulting Riemannian classical geometry, arising from the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation, does not close smoothly in the interior. The
canonical quantum theory of supergravity is also described, and may lead to
very streamlined (finite) calculations of loop amplitudes for N=1 supergravity
with gauged supermatter. If one uses Ashtekar/Jacobson variables for canonical
supergravity, then again (for \Lambda\neq 0) one arrives at a (supersymmetric)
Chern-Simons action and quantum state in the (anti-)self-dual case.

should be equivalent to an SU(4) flavor-symmetric system up to lattice

by an additive term due to the taste breaking of the staggered action. The
relation is the same for 2 and 1 flavor fermions. This additive mass shift
implies that at finite lattice spacing staggered simulations correspond to

is essentially identical to the Gross-Witten transition in the D=1+1 SU(oo)
lattice gauge theory. There is also evidence for a second order transition at
N=oo at approximately the same coupling, which is connected with centre
monopoles (instantons) and so analogues to the first order bulk transition that
occurs in D=3+1 lattice gauge theories for N>4. We show that as the lattice
spacing is reduced, the N=oo gauge theory on a finite 3-torus suffers a
sequence of (apparently) first-order ZN symmetry breaking transitions
associated with each of the tori (ordered by size). We discuss how these
transitions can be understood in terms of a sequence of deconfining transitions
on ever-more dimensionally reduced gauge theories.We investigate whether the
trace of the Wilson loop has a non-analyticity in the coupling at some critical
area, but find no evidence for this although, just as in D=1+1,the eigenvalue
density of a Wilson loop forms a gap at N=oo for a critical trace. The physical
implications of this are unclear.The gap formation is a special case of a
remarkable similarity between the eigenvalue spectra of Wilson loops in D=1+1
and D=2+1 (and indeed D=3+1): for the same value of the trace, the eigenvalue
spectra are nearly identical.This holds for finite as well as infinite N;
irrespective of the Wilson loop size in lattice units; and for Polyakov as well
as Wilson loops.

the proposed BPS equation - which is from the point of view of the M2-brane
world-volume dynamics - with boundary conditions appropriate for M2-branes
stretching between two M5-branes. Unfortunately, since the action for multiple
M5-branes or for multiple coincident M2-branes is not known, one can only
resort to consistency checks of the proposal instead of a direct comparison of
the M2 and M5 world-volume point of views. The existence of our solutions
should be seen as such a consistency check of the conjecture, and also as a
source of new insight into the dynamics of multiple M2 and M5-branes.

  Moreover, the fundamental notion of parkization allows one to endow the set
of parking functions of fixed length with an associative multiplication
(different from the one coming from the Shi arrangement), leading to a
generalization of the internal product of symmetric functions. Several of the

the Solomon descent algebra but also a new algebra based on a Catalan set,

leads to a sparse graph with an average degree growing logarithmically with the
