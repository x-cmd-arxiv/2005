combine with previously published data to obtain a radial velocity sample with

hint of rotation about an axis near Fornax's morphological minor axis, though
the significance of the rotation signal in the galactic rest frame is sensitive
to the adopted value of Fornax's proper motion. Regardless, the observed
stellar kinematics are dominated by random motions, and we do not find
kinematic evidence of tidal disruption. The projected velocity dispersion
profile of the binned dataset remains flat over the sampled region, which
reaches a maximum angular radius of 65 arcmin. Single-component King models in
which mass follows light fail to reproduce the observed flatness of the
velocity dispersion profile. Two-component (luminous plus dark matter) models
can reproduce the data, provided the dark component extends sufficiently beyond
the luminous component, and the central dark matter density is of the same
order as the central luminous density. These requirements suggest a more
massive, darker Fornax than standard core-fitting analyses have previously
concluded, with M/L_V over the sampled region reaching 10 to 40 times the M/L_V
of the luminous component. We also apply a non-parametric mass estimation
technique, introduced in a companion paper. Though it is designed to operate on
datasets containing velocities for $>$1000 stars, the estimation yields
preliminary results suggesting M/L_V ~ 15 inside r < 1.5 kpc.

one of these stars forms with a fixed mass in every collapsed halo in which

stars previously formed in one of their halo progenitors will form only stars
with metals, which are assigned an emissivity of ionizing radiation equal to

We examine the impact of molecular hydrogen photodissociation (which tends to
reduce cooling when a photodissociating background is produced by the first
stars) and X-Ray photoheating (which heats the atomic medium, raising the
entropy of the gas before it collapses into halos). We find that in the
CDM$\Lambda$ model supported by present observations, and even assuming no

notable for their large radial range extending from 0'7 to 14'5 (2 to 42 kpc)

These velocity dispersions are consistent with a dark matter halo around NGC
3379 with a concentration in the range expected from a LCDM cosmological model
and a total mass of ~ 6 x 10^11 Msun. Such a model is also consistent with the
stellar velocity dispersion at small radii and the rotation of the HI ring at
large radii, and has a M/L_B that increases by a factor of five from several
kpc to 100 kpc. Our velocity dispersion for the globular cluster system of NGC
3379 is somewhat higher than that found for the planetary nebulae (PNe) in the
inner region covered by the PN data, and we discuss possible reasons for this
difference. For NGC 3384, we find the GC system has a rotation signature
broadly similar to that seen in other kinematic probes of this SB0 galaxy. This

by a damped Ly-alpha (DLA) feature with a neutral hydrogen column density of
logN(HI)=22.05+/-0.10, higher than that of any QSO-DLA detected to date, but
similar to several other recent measurements from GRB spectra. In addition, we
detect absorption lines from both low- and high-ionization species from which
we deduce a metallicity, Z~0.06 Z_solar, with a depletion pattern that is
roughly similar to that of the Galactic warm halo, warm disk, or disk+halo.
More importantly, we detect strong absorption from SiII* indicating a dense
environment, n_H>10^2 cm^-3, in the vicinity of the burst, with a size of about
4 pc. In addition, the CIV absorption system spans a velocity range of about
1000 km/s, which is not detected in any other absorption feature. We show that
the most likely interpretation for this wide velocity range is absorption in
the wind from the progenitor star. In this context, the lack of corresponding
SiIV absorption indicates that the progenitor had a mass of <25 M_solar and a
metallicity <0.1 Z_solar, and therefore required a binary companion to eject
its hydrogen envelope prior to the GRB explosion. Finally, by extending the
GRB-DLA sample to z~4.3 we show that these objects appear to follow a similar
metallicity-redshift relation as in QSO-DLAs, but with systematically higher
metallicities. It remains to be seen whether this trend is simply due to the
higher neutral hydrogen columns in GRB-DLAs, or if it is a manifestation of
different star formation properties in GRB-DLAs. [abridged]

explanation in the framework of jetted fireballs, whose semiaperture angle
$\theta_{j}$ is measured by the jet break time $t^\prime_{j}$. By correcting
$E_{\gamma, iso}$ for the angle $\theta_{j}$ one obtains the so called
Ghirlanda correlation linking the collimation corrected energy $E_\gamma$ and
$E^\prime_{p}$. There are two ways to derive $\theta_{j}$ from $t^\prime_{j}$
in the standard scenario, corresponding to an homogeneous or to a wind-like
circumburst medium. We show that the Ghirlanda correlation with a wind-like
medium is as tight as (if not tighter) than the Ghirlanda correlation found in
the case of an homogeneous medium. There are hence two Ghirlanda correlations,
both entirely consistent with the phenomenological Liang & Zhang relation. We
consider the difference between the observed correlations and the ones one
would see in the comoving frame (i.e. moving with the same bulk Lorentz factor
of the fireball). Since both $E_{p}$ and $E_\gamma$ transform in the same way,
the wind-like Ghirlanda relation, which is linear, remains linear also in the
comoving frame, no matter the distribution of bulk Lorentz factors. Instead, in
the homogeneous density case, one is forced to assume the existence of a strict
relation between the bulk Lorentz factor and the total energy, which in turn
put constraints on the radiation mechanisms of the prompt emission. The
wind-like Ghirlanda correlation, being linear, corresponds to different bursts
having the same number of photons.

galaxy formation. In principle, radio-galaxies are energetic enough to halt the
cooling of the virialized intracluster medium (ICM) in the inner regions of
galaxy clusters, solving the cooling flow problem and explaining the high-mass
truncation of the galaxy luminosity function. We explore this process through a
series of high resolution, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of jetted
active galaxies that act in response to cooling-mediated accretion of an ICM
atmosphere. We find that our models are incapable of producing a long term
balance of heating and cooling; catastrophic cooling can be delayed by the jet
action but inevitably takes hold. At the heart of the failure of these models
is the formation of a low density channel through which the jet can freely
flow, carrying its energy out of the cooling core. It is possible that this
failure is due to an over-simplified treatment of the fast jet (which may
underestimate the ``dentist drill'' effect). However, it seems likely that
additional complexity (large-angle jet precession or ICM turbulence) or
additional physics (magnetohydrodynamic effects and plasma transport processes)
is required to produce a spatial distribution of jet heating that can prevent
catastrophic cooling. This work also underscores the importance of including
jet dynamics in any feedback model as opposed to the isotropically inflated
bubble approach taken in some previous works.

deviations from spherical symmetry. While rotation has been the main proposed
explanation, other complicating factors such as their constant interaction with
the strong gravitational potential of their host galaxy have made it difficult
for a consensus to be reached. To address this question we have obtained
high-resolution spectra of WLM-1, the lone globular cluster associated with the
isolated, low-mass dwarf irregular galaxy WLM. Using archival HST WFPC2 data,
we measure the radial ellipticity profile of WLM-1, finding it to be highly
elliptical, with a mean value of 0.17 in the region 0.5-5"" -- which is
comparable to what is found in our Galaxy for the most elliptical globular
clusters. There is no evidence of isophote twisting, except for the innermost
regions of the cluster (r < 0.5""). To investigate whether the observed
flattening can be ascribed to rotation, we have obtained long-slit
high-resolution VLT/UVES spectra of this cluster along and perpendicular to the
axis of flattening. Using cross-correlation we find that the velocity profile
of the cluster is consistent with zero rotation along either axis. Thus neither
cluster rotation nor galactic tides can be responsible for the flattened
morphology of WLM-1. We argue that the required velocity dispersion anisotropy
between the semi-major and semi-minor axes that would be required to account
for the observed flattening is relatively small, of order 1 km/s. Even though
our errors preclude us from conclusively establishing that such a difference
indeed exists, velocity anisotropy remains at present the most plausible
explanation for the shape of this cluster.

spectral coverage, as well as to handle observational errors in a principled
way. We apply this method to a sample of 21 well-studied early-type spectra,
with known star-formation histories. We find that our data-driven Bayesian
modelling allows us to identify those early-types which contain a significant
stellar population <~ 1 Gyr old. This method would therefore be a very useful
tool for automatically discovering various interesting sub-classes of galaxies.

3He/H abundance ratios for PNe should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than
the primordial value (3He/H ~ 1e-5 by number) determined from Galactic HII
region abundances and confirmed by WMAP cosmic microwave background results.
Chemical evolution models suggest that fewer than 5% of all PNe enrich the
interstellar medium (ISM) with 3He at the level of standard stellar models. Our
target PNe are therefore anomalous in that they were selected from a sample
deliberately biased to contain objects with properties that maximized the
likelihood of a 3He detection by the VLA. We have detected the 8.665 GHz
hyperfine 3He+ transition in J320 at the 4 sigma level. The 3He/H abundance
ratio is 1.9e-3 with roughly a factor of two uncertainty. For NGC 6572 we find
an upper limit of 3He/H <= 1e-3. This detection of 3He in J320 makes it the
second PN known to have an anomalously high 3He abundance confirming that at
least some low-mass stars produce significant amounts of 3He that survives to
the PN stage and enriches the ISM.

a more complicated phenomenology than was known before. In particular, the
presence of flaring activity on a wide range of time scales probably requires
late-time energy production within the GRB engine. Since the flaring activity
is observed in both long and short GRBs, its origin must be within what is in
common for the two likely progenitors of the two classes of bursts: a
hyperaccreting accretion disk around a black hole of a few solar masses. Here,
we show that some of the observational properties of the flares, such as the
duration-time scale correlation, and the duration-peak luminosity
anticorrelation displayed by most flares within a given burst, are
qualitatively consistent with viscous disk evolution, provided that the disk at
large radii either fragments or otherwise suffers large amplitude variability.
We discuss the physical conditions in the outer parts of the disk, and conclude
that gravitational instability, possibly followed by fragmentation, is the most
likely candidate for this variability.

in X-rays (47% of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population of
obscured AGN not detected even in deep X-ray surveys. The majority of the IR
power-law galaxies are ULIRGs at z>1, and those with LIRG-like IR luminosities

(SEDs) of the X-ray detected galaxies are almost equally divided between a
BLAGN SED class (similar to an optically selected QSO) and a NLAGN SED (similar
to the BLAGN SED but with an obscured UV/optical continuum). A small fraction
of SEDs resemble warm ULIRG galaxies (e.g., Mrk231). Most galaxies not detected
in X-rays have SEDs in the NLAGN+ULIRG class as they tend to be optically
fainter, and possibly more obscured. Moreover, the IR power-law galaxies have
SEDs significantly different from those of high-z (z_sp>1) IR (24 micron)
selected and optically bright (VVDS I_AB<=24) star-forming galaxies whose SEDs
show a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron. The galaxies detected in
X-rays have 2-8 keV rest-frame luminosities typical of AGN. The galaxies not
detected in X-rays have global X-ray to mid-IR SED properties that make them
good candidates to contain IR bright X-ray absorbed AGN. If all these sources
are actually obscured AGN, we would observe a ratio of obscured to unobscured
24 micron detected AGN of 2:1, whereas models predict a ratio of up to 3:1.

fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). If this is indeed the case, then the
explosion blast wave propagates into a complex density structure, composed of a
stellar wind bounded by two shock waves - a wind reverse shock and a forward
shock. As the explosion blast wave reaches R_0, the radius of the wind reverse
shock, it splits into two shock waves - a reverse and a forward shock wave. We
show that the reverse shock thus produced is not strong, therefore full
analytical treatment is required in calculating its properties. We calculate
the dynamics of the flow and the evolution of the blast waves in all of the
different stages. We show that the fluid Lorentz factor at r>R_0 is equal to
0.725 times the blast wave Lorentz factor as it reaches R_0, and is time (and
r) independent as long as the blast wave reverse shock exists. Following the
calculation of the blast wave evolution, we calculate the radiation expected in
different energy bands. We show that about a day after the main explosion, as
the blast wave reaches R_0, the observed afterglow flux starts to rise. It
rises by a factor of about 2 in a few hours, during which the blast wave
reverse shock exists, and then declines. We show that the power law index
describing light curve time evolution is different at early (before the rise)
and late times, and is frequency dependent. We present light curves in the
different energy bands for this scenario.

a general extended medium in any of our fields, and the upper limits we can

discrete X-ray emission sources we detect cannot be explained as the X-ray jets
frequently seen associated with radio-loud quasars, nor can they be due to
electron scattering of nuclear emission. The most plausible explanation is that
they result from high-speed shocks from galactic superwinds resulting either
from a starburst in the QSO host galaxy or from the activation of the QSO
itself. Evidence from densities and velocities found from studies of the

\~3.10^6 solar masses supermassive black hole. In some cases, the transient
emission appears to be modulated with a (quasi-)periodic oscillation (QPO) of ~
17-20 minutes. The implied ~ 3 r_S size of the emitter (where r_S = 2GM/c^2 is
the Schwarzschild radius) points to an instability - possibly induced by
accretion - near the Marginally Stable Orbit (MSO) of a slowly spinning object.
But Sgr A* is not accreting via a large, `standard' disk; instead, the low
density environment surrounding it apparently feeds the black hole with low
angular momentum clumps of plasma that circularize within ~ 10-300 r_S and
merge onto a compact, hot disk. In this Letter, we follow the evolution of the
disk following such an event, and show that a Rossby wave instability,

a period of enhanced accretion lasting several hours. Both the amplitude of
this response, and its duration, match the observed flare characteristics

birth-cluster, i.e. a cluster of young and massive stars spatially and
physically associated with it. On the basis of the classical reddening-free
parameter Q, we have identified a sample of 24 early-type stars with colours
typical of spectral types earlier than B3. Interestingly, these stars are
clustered within a radius of 1 arcmin from WRA751, corresponding to about 1% of
the imaged field. These stars tightly distribute around (B-V) = 1.67, which in
turn defines a mean extinction A(V) = 6.1 mag. The 5 brighter (V > 16.2) and
bluer (Q < -0.9) stars of the sample have been subsequently observed with FORS1
and classified as 3 late O- and 2 early B- stars. The absence of stars earlier
than O8 indicates an age of the cluster older than 4 Myr, although it could be
due to an incomplete sampling of the upper end of the main sequence.
Nevertheless, the detection of OB stars of class I certainly indicates an age
of a few million years. At an assumed distance of 6 kpc, we estimate a cluster
radius of 3.4 pc and a total mass of 2200 solar masses. Our discovery is only
the second known instance of a Galactic Luminous Blue Variable associated with
its birth-cluster.

relativistic 3.98-hr orbit with an eccentricity of 0.085 and expected
gravitational wave coalescence time of 300 Myr. The new pulsar was found during
precursor survey observations with the Arecibo 1.4-GHz feed array system and
retrospectively detected in the Parkes Multibeam plane pulsar survey data. From
radio follow-up observations with Arecibo, Jodrell Bank, Green Bank, and
Parkes, we have measured the spin-down and binary parameters of the pulsar and
its basic spectral and polarization properties. We also present evidence for
pulse profile evolution, which is likely due to geodetic precession, a
relativistic effect caused by the misalignment of the pulsar spin and total
angular momentum vectors. Our measurements show that PSR J1906+0746 is a young
object with a characteristic age of 112 kyr. From the measured rate of orbital
periastron advance 7.57+/-0.03 deg/yr, we infer a total system mass of
2.61+/-0.02 Msun. While these parameters suggest that the PSR J1906+0746 binary
system might be a younger version of the double pulsar system, intensive
searches for radio pulses from the companion have so far been unsuccessful. It
is therefore not known whether the companion is another neutron star or a
massive white dwarf. Regardless of the nature of the companion, a simple
calculation suggests that the Galactic birth rate of binaries similar to PSR
J1906+0746 is 60/Myr. This implies that PSR J1906+0746 will make a significant
contribution to the computed cosmic inspiral rate of compact binary systems.

of statistical scattering by chaotic cavities, when short paths may play an
important role in the scattering process. In particular, the validity of the

conductance in open chaotic cavities. In this article we investigate further
the validity of the maximum-entropy model, by comparing the theoretical
predictions with the results of computer simulations, in which the Schroedinger
equation is solved numerically inside the cavity for one and two open channels
in the leads; we analyze, in addition to the conductance, the zero-frequency
limit of the shot-noise power spectrum. We also obtain theoretical results for
the ensemble average of this last quantity, for the orthogonal and unitary
cases of the circular ensemble and an arbitrary number of channels. Generally
speaking, the agreement between theory and numerics is good. In some of the
cavities that we study, short paths consist of whispering gallery modes, which
were excluded in previous studies. These cavities turn out to be all the more
interesting, as it is in relation with them that we found certain systematic
discrepancies in the comparison with theory. We give evidence that it is the
lack of stationarity inside the energy interval that is analyzed, and hence the
lack of ergodicity that gives rise to the discrepancies. Indeed, the agreement
between theory and numerical simulations is improved when the energy interval
is reduced to a point and the statistics is then collected over an ensemble. It
thus appears that the maximum-entropy model is valid beyond the domain where it
was originally derived. An understanding of this situation is still lacking at
the present moment.

obtained by applying an exponential operator $\exp{T}$ to the ground
configuration $|\phi_0>$. The natural ground configuration for bosons is, of
course, when all reside in a single orbital. Because of this simple structure
of $|\phi_0>$, the appearance of excitation operators $T=\sum_{n=1}^N T_n$ for
bosons is much simpler than for fermions. We can treat very large numbers of
bosons with coupled-cluster expansions. In a substantial part of this work, we
address the issue of size consistency for bosons and enquire whether truncated
coupled-cluster expansions are size consistent. We show that, in contrast to
the familiar situation for fermions for which coupled-cluster expansions are
size consistent, for bosons the answer to this question {\it depends} on the
choice of ground configuration. Utilizing the natural ground configuration,
working equations for the truncated coupled-cluster with $T=T_1+T_2$, i.e.,
coupled-cluster singles doubles (CCSD) are explicitly derived. Finally, an

in which particles can form reversible bonds with a predefined maximum number
of neighbors. We focus on three and four maximally coordinated particles, since
in these two cases the low valency makes it possible to probe, in equilibrium,
slow dynamics down to very low temperatures $T$. By studying a large region of
$T$ and packing fraction $\phi$ we are able to estimate both the location of
the liquid-gas phase separation spinodal and the locus of dynamic arrest, where
the system is trapped in a disordered non-ergodic state. We find that there are
two distinct arrest lines for the system: a {\it glass} line at high packing
fraction, and a {\it gel} line at low $\phi$ and $T$. The former is rather
vertical ($\phi$-controlled), while the latter is rather horizontal
($T$-controlled) in the $(\phi-T)$ plane. Dynamics on approaching the glass
line along isotherms exhibit a power-law dependence on $\phi$, while dynamics
along isochores follow an activated (Arrhenius) dependence. The gel has clearly
distinct properties from those of both a repulsive and an attractive glass. A
gel to glass crossover occurs in a fairly narrow range in $\phi$ along low $T$
isotherms, seen most strikingly in the behavior of the non-ergodicity factor.
Interestingly, we detect the presence of anomalous dynamics, such as
subdiffusive behavior for the mean squared displacement and logarithmic decay
for the density correlation functions in the region where the gel dynamics
interferes with the glass dynamics.

in the frequency range 0.1-1 Hz. The major astrophysical foreground in this
range is gravitational radiation from inspiraling compact binaries. This
foreground is expected to be much larger than the inflation-generated
background, so to accomplish its main goal, BBO must be sensitive enough to
identify and subtract out practically all such binaries in the observable
universe. It is somewhat subtle to decide whether BBO's current baseline design
is sufficiently sensitive for this task, since, at least initially, the
dominant noise source impeding identification of any one binary is confusion
noise from all the others. Here we present a self-consistent scheme for
deciding whether BBO's baseline design is indeed adequate for subtracting out
the binary foreground. We conclude that the current baseline should be
sufficient. However if BBO's instrumental sensitivity were degraded by a factor
2-4, it could no longer perform its main mission. It is impossible to perfectly
subtract out each of the binary inspiral waveforms, so an important question is
how to deal with the ""residual"" errors in the post-subtraction data stream. We
sketch a strategy of ""projecting out"" these residual errors, at the cost of
some effective bandwidth. We also provide estimates of the sizes of various
post-Newtonian effects in the inspiral waveforms that must be accounted for in

doublet of Wilson quarks with chirally rotated boundary conditions. This allows
to perform checks of universality: for instance, the renormalized SF coupling
constant, defined with either boundary conditions, must have a unique continuum
limit. Similarly, SF correlation functions in twisted mass QCD and standard QCD
can be defined such that they share a common continuum limit. An additional
benefit of the new set-up consists in the observation that all the bulk O(a)
counterterms to the action and composite operators become irrelevant in the
chiral limit. This implies that (ratios of) SF renormalization constants can be
automatically O(a) improved, up to the effect of unavoidable boundary
counterterms. As a first application we calculate the running coupling for Nf=2
flavours in the SF-scheme to one-loop order of perturbation theory.
Universality of the continuum limit is confirmed and the irrelevance of the

is shown that such dangerous lattice artifacts are strongly suppressed if the

and right handed neutrinos. We investigate the viability of the mechansim known

puzzle and explaining the observed neutrino sector phenomenology. To
successfully address these issues, the scenario requires the introduction of at
least two new heavy fields. If a hierarchy among these new fields is
introduced, and some reasonable stipulations are made on the couplings that
appear in the superpotential, it becomes a generic feature to obtain the
observed large lepton mixing angles. We show that in this case, it is possible
simultaneously to obtain both the correct neutrino phenomenology and enough
baryon number, making thermal Dirac neutrinogenesis viable. However, due to
cosmological constraints, its ability to satisfy these constraints depends
nontrivially on model parameters of the overall theory, particularly the

smoking-gun signals for models containing Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimensions
(SLEDs), which have been proposed as approaches for resolving the Cosmological
Constant Problem. Just like their non-supersymmetric counterparts, SLED models
predict gravity to deviate from the inverse-square law because of the advent of
new dimensions at sub-millimeter scales. However SLED models differ from their
non-supersymmetric counterparts in three important ways: (i) the size of the
extra dimensions is fixed by the observed value of the Dark Energy density,
making it impossible to shorten the range over which new deviations from
Newton's law must be seen; (ii) supersymmetry predicts there to be more fields
in the extra dimensions than just gravity, implying different types of
couplings to matter and the possibility of repulsive as well as attractive
interactions; and (iii) the same mechanism which is purported to keep the
cosmological constant naturally small also keeps the extra-dimensional moduli
effectively massless, leading to deviations from General Relativity in the far
infrared of the scalar-tensor form. We here explore the deviations from
Newton's Law which are predicted over micron distances, and show the ways in
which they differ and resemble those in the non-supersymmetric case.

  Quantised Orthosymplectic Superalgebra","Approx. 120 pages, no figures, PhD thesis",,,,"math.QA",,"  For the last fifteen years quantum superalgebras have been used to model
supersymmetric quantum systems. A class of quasi-triangular Hopf superalgebras,
they each contain a universal $R$-matrix, which automatically satisfies the
Yang--Baxter equation. Applying the vector representation to the left-hand side
of a universal $R$-matrix gives a Lax operator. These are of significant
interest in mathematical physics as they provide solutions to the Yang--Baxter
equation in an arbitrary representation, which give rise to integrable models.
  In this thesis a Lax operator is constructed for the quantised
orthosymplectic superalgebra $U_q[osp(m|n)]$ for all $m > 2, n \geq 2$ where
$n$ is even. This can then be used to find a solution to the Yang--Baxter
equation in an arbitrary representation of $U_q[osp(m|n)]$, with the example of
the vector representation given in detail.
  In studying the integrable models arising from solutions to the Yang--Baxter
equation, it is desirable to understand the representation theory of the
superalgebra. Finding the Casimir invariants of the system and exploring their
behaviour helps in this understanding. In this thesis the Lax operator is used
to construct an infinite family of Casimir invariants of $U_q[osp(m|n)]$ and to
calculate their eigenvalues in an arbitrary irreducible representation.

of these metrics has a simple description in terms of Teichm\""uller theory. In
the hyperbolic settings both questions have positive answers for a certain
subset of the quasi-Fuchsian manifolds: those containing a closed surface with
principal curvatures at most 1. We show that this subset is parameterized by an
open domain of the cotangent bundle of Teichm\""uller space. These results are
extended to ``quasi-Fuchsian'' manifolds with conical singularities along
infinite lines, known in the physics literature as ``massive, spin-less
particles''.
  Things work better for globally hyperbolic anti-de Sitter manifolds: the
parameterization by the cotangent of Teichm\""uller space works for all
manifolds. There is another description of this moduli space as the product two
copies of Teichm\""uller space due to Mess. Using the maximal surface
description, we propose a new parameterization by two copies of Teichm\""uller
space, alternative to that of Mess, and extend all the results to manifolds
with conical singularities along time-like lines. Similar results are obtained
for de Sitter or Minkowski manifolds.
  Finally, for all four settings, we show that the symplectic form on the
moduli space of 3-manifolds that comes from parameterization by the cotangent
bundle of Teichm\""uller space is the same as the 3-dimensional gravity one.

with the internal energy or heat capacity calculation, different estimators

more computational benefits. We also consider two different methods for
treating the flux operator, i.e., local-path and global-path approaches, in
which the latter achieves a smaller variance at the cost of using second-order

effort has been devoted to the optimization of the mean flow and the lateral

and hence the necessary motor power. The main focus of this paper lies on the
role of ''lid layers'', i.e. layers of liquid sodium between the impellers and
the end walls of the cylinder. First, we study an analytical test flow to show
that lid layers can have an ambivalent effect on the efficiency of the dynamo.
The critical magnetic Reynolds number shows a flat minimum for a small lid
layer thickness, but increases for thicker layers. For the actual VKS geometry
it is shown that static lid layers yield a moderate increase of the critical
magnetic Reynolds number by approximately 12 per cent. A more dramatic increase
by 100 until 150 per cent can occur when some rotational flow is taken into
account in those layers. Possible solutions of this problem are discussed for
the real dynamo facility.

using the standard asexual Penna model, with individuals characterized by a
string of bits representing a genome containing some possible mutations. After
about 20000 simulation steps, when only a few genetic families are still
present from among rich variety of families at the beginning of the simulation
game, strong peaks in mutation distribution functions are observed. This known
effect is due to evolution rules with hereditary mechanism. The birth and death
balance in the simulation game also leads to elimination of families specified
by different genomes. Number of families $G(t)$ versus time $t$ follow the
power law, $G \propto t^n$. Our results show the power coefficient exponent $n$
is changing as the time goes. Starting from about --1, smoothly achieves about
--2 after hundreds of steps, and finally has semi-smooth transition to 0, when
only one family exists in the environment. This is in contrast with constant
$n$ about --1 as found, for example, in \cite{bib:evolution}. We suspect that
this discrepancy may be due to two different time scales in simulations -
initial stages follow the $n\approx-1$ law, yet for large number of simulation
steps we get $n\approx-2$, providing random initial population was sufficiently
big to allow for still reliable statistical analysis. The $n\approx-1$
evolution stage seems to be associated with the Verhulst mechanism of
population elimination due to the limited environmental capacity - when the
standard evolution rules were modified, we observed a plateau ($n=0$) in the
power law in short time scale, again followed by $n\approx -2$ law for longer
times. The modified model uses birth rate controlled by the current population
instead of the standard Verhulst death factor.

mutually complement via purification of density matrices, but its operational

the Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters (HJW) quantum nonlocality. The HJW nonlocality
tells us how, for a given density matrix rho, Alice can generate any
rho-ensemble on the North Star. This is done using surprisingly few resources -
one shared entangled state (prepared in advance), one generalized quantum
measurement, and no communication. Similarly, our classical nonlocality
presents how, for a given probability distribution P, Alice can generate any
P-ensemble on the North Star, using only one correlated state (prepared in
advance), one (generalized) classical measurement, and no communication.
  It is important to clarify that while the classical teleportation and the
classical non-locality protocols are probably rather insignificant from a
classical information processing point of view, they significantly contribute
to our understanding of what exactly is quantum in their well established and
highly famous quantum analogues.

problems. We show how to infer the quantum state of a non-relativistic
N-dimensional harmonic oscillator system by simple inverse Radon transforms.
The procedure is equally applicable to finding the joint quantum state of
several distinguishable particles in different harmonic oscillator potentials.
A requirement of the procedure is that the angular frequencies of the N
harmonic potentials are incommensurable. We discuss what kind of information
can be found if the requirement of incommensurability is not fulfilled and also
under what conditions the state can be reconstructed from finite time
measurements. As a further example of quantum state reconstruction in N
dimensions we consider the two related cases of an N-dimensional free particle
with periodic boundary conditions and a particle in an N-dimensional box, where
we find a similar condition of incommensurability and finite recurrence time
for the one-dimensional system.

of light onto the collective spin state of an atomic ensemble. The entangled
state of light and atoms employed as a resource in this protocol is created by
probing the collective atomic spin, Larmor precessing in an external magnetic
field, off resonantly with a coherent pulse of light. We take here for the
first time full account of the effects of Larmor precession and show that it
gives rise to a qualitatively new type of multimode entangled state of light
and atoms. The protocol is shown to be robust against the dominating sources of
noise and can be implemented with an atomic ensemble at room temperature
interacting with free space light. We also provide a scheme to perform the
readout of the Larmor precessing spin state enabling the verification of
successful teleportation as well as the creation of spin squeezing.

evaluated exactly: I) It starts quadratically up to a spreading time t_{S}. II)
It follows an exponential behavior governed by a self-consistent Fermi Golden
Rule. III) At longer times, the exponential is overrun by an inverse power law
describing return processes governed by quantum diffusion. At this last
transition time t_{R} a survival collapse becomes possible, bringing the
polarization down by several orders of magnitude. We identify this strongly
destructive interference as an antiresonance in the time domain. These general
phenomena are suitable for observation through an NMR experiment.
