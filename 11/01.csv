disk galaxies has been studied with N-body and N-body/SPH simulations at
different resolutions. In pure N-body simulations no bound objects are formed
at high resolution. At low resolution bound objects can form in tidal tails in
agreement with previous work. We conclude that tidal dwarf galaxies are not
likely to form by pure collisionless collapse in tidal tails. However, the
presence of a sufficiently massive and extended gas component in the progenitor
disk supports the formation of bound stellar objects in the tidal arms. Our
results clearly favor a dissipation supported scenario in which the formation
of TDGs is induced by the local collapse of gas which then triggers the
collapse of the stellar component.

develop a semianalytic model to examine temperature fluctuations resulting from
inhomogeneous HI and incomplete HeII reionizations. Detection of these
fluctuations might provide insight into the reionization histories of hydrogen
and helium. Furthermore, these fluctuations, neglected in previous analyses,
could bias constraints on cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest.
We find that the temperature fluctuations resulting from inhomogeneous HI
reionization are likely to be very small, with an rms amplitude of < 5%,
$\sigma_{T_0}/<T_0> < 0.05$. More important are the temperature fluctuations
that arise from incomplete HeII reionization, which might plausibly be as large
as 50%, $\sigma_{T_0}/<T_0> ~ 0.5$. In practice, however, these temperature
fluctuations have only a small effect on flux power spectrum predictions. The
smallness of the effect is possibly due to density fluctuations dominating over
temperature fluctuations on the scales probed by current measurements. On the
largest scales currently probed, k ~ 0.001 s/km (~0.1 h/Mpc), the effect on the
flux power spectrum may be as large as ~10% in extreme models. The effect is
larger on small scales, up to ~20% at k = 0.1 s/km, due to thermal broadening.
Our results suggest that the omission of temperature fluctuations effects from
previous analyses does not significantly bias constraints on cosmological
parameters.

The SoHO community has shown that the length of the solar cycle depends on the
transition region between radiation and convection. Nevertheless, the internal
solar (stellar) magnetism stays poorly known. Starting in 2008, the American
instrument HMI/SDO and the European microsatellite PICARD will enrich our view

clear objective for the next decades and it requires complementary observations
of the dynamics of the radiative zone. For that ambitious goal, space
prototypes are being developed to improve gravity mode detection. The Sun is
unique to progress on the topology of deep internal magnetic fields and to
understand the complex mechanisms which provoke photospheric and coronal
magnetic changes and possible longer cycles important for human life. We
propose the following roadmap in Europe to contribute to this ""impressive""

PICARD (2008-2010), DynaMICS (2009-2017) in parallel to SDO (2008-2017) then a

stronger anti-correlation is shown between the PAH EW and the product of the

located via rolling SN searches. The technique, using both color and magnitude
information of events from only 2-3 epochs of multi-band real-time photometry,
is able to discriminate between SNe Ia and core collapse SNe. Furthermore, for
the SNe Ia, the method accurately predicts the redshift, phase and light-curve
parameterization of these events based only on pre-maximum-light data. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique on a simulated survey of SNe Ia
and core-collapse SNe, where the selection method effectively rejects most
core-collapse SNe while retaining SNe Ia. We also apply the selection code to
real-time data acquired as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova
Legacy Survey (SNLS). During the period May 2004 to January 2005 in the SNLS,
440 SN candidates were discovered of which 70 were confirmed spectroscopically
as SNe Ia and 15 as core-collapse events. For this test dataset, the selection
technique correctly identifies 100% of the identified SNe II as non-SNe Ia with
only a 1-2% false rejection rate. The predicted parameterization of the SNe Ia
has a precision of |delta_z|/(1+z_spec)<0.09 in redshift, and +/- 2-3
rest-frame days in phase, providing invaluable information for planning
spectroscopic follow-up observations. We also investigate any bias introduced
by this selection method on the ability of surveys such as SNLS to measure

relativistic iron line from the accretion disc, and the superposition of a
narrow 6.4 keV line from distant material and a relativistic one. We find that
a contribution from a distant reflector is not required by the data. We also
perform a time-resolved analysis searching for short-timescale variability of

analysed based upon resolved counts of red giant branch stars. For each object,
we have derived isopleth maps, surface brightness profiles, absolute
magnitudes, central surface brightnesses, and a large number of other
morphological parameters. Our analysis probes to larger radius and fainter
surface brightnesses than most previous studies and as a result we find that
the galaxies are generally larger and brighter than has previously been
recognised. In particular, the luminosity of Andromeda V is found to be
consistent with the higher metallicity value which has been derived for it.
Andromeda I shows strong evidence of tidal disruption and S-shaped tidal tails
are clearly visible. On the other hand, Cetus does not show any evidence of
tidal truncation, let alone disruption. Andromeda II shows compelling evidence
of a large excess of stars at small radius and suggests that this galaxy
consists of a secondary core component. Comparing the M31 dwarf spheroidal
population with the Galactic population, we find that the scale radii of the
M31 population are larger than those for the Galactic population by at least a
factor of two, for all absolute magnitudes. We also find that the two
populations are offset from one another in the central surface brightness -
luminosity relation. Finally, we find that the M31 dwarf spheroidals show the
same correlation with distance-from-host as shown by the Galactic population,
such that dwarf spheroidals with a higher central surface brightness are found
further from their host. This again suggests that environment plays a
significant role in dwarf galaxy evolution.

field strength, B, and super-radial expansion of the cross section, f_max. We
find that a transonic solar wind is the universal consequence. The atmosphere
is also stably heated up to >10^6K by the dissipation of the Alfven waves
through compressive-wave generation and wave reflection in the case of the
sufficient wave input with photospheric amplitude, <dv> > 0.7km/s. The density,
and accordingly the mass flux, of solar winds show a quite sensitive dependence
on <dv> because of an unstable aspect of the heating by the nonlinear Alfven
waves. A case with <dv>=0.4km/s gives ~50 times smaller mass flux than the
fiducial case for the fast wind with <dv>=0.7km/s; solar wind almost disappears
only if <dv> becomes half. We also find that the solar wind speed has a
positive correlation with B/f_max, which is consistent with recent
observations. We finally show that both fast and slow solar winds can be
explained by the single process, the dissipation of the low-frequency Alfven
waves, with different sets of <dv> and B/f_max. Our simulations naturally
explain the observed (i) anticorrelation of the solar wind speed and the
coronal temperature and (ii) larger amplitude of the Alfvenic fluctuations in
the fast winds. In Appendix, we also explain our implementation of the outgoing
boundary condition of the MHD waves with some numerical tests.

the reconnection outflow, which is essential to determine the entire
reconnection system (Nitta et al. 2002). The outflow is consist of several
regions divided by discontinuities, e.g., shocks, and it can be treated by a
shock-tube approximation (Nitta 2004). By solving the junction conditions
(e.g., Rankine-Hugoniot condition), the structure of the reconnection outflow
is obtained. Magnetic reconnection in most astrophysical problems is
characterized by a huge dynamic range of its expansion ($sim 10^7$ for typical
solar flares) in a free space which is free from any influence of external
circumstances. Such evolution results in a spontaneous self-similar expansion
which is controlled by two intrinsic parameters: the plasma-$beta$ and the
magnetic Reynolds number. The plasma-$beta$ dependence had been investigated in
our previous paper. This paper newly clarifies the relation between the
reconnection rate and the inflow structure just outside the Petschek-like slow
shock: As the magnetic Reynolds number increases, strongly converging inflow
toward the Petschek-like slow shock forms, and it significantly reduces the

single stellar population models we find that these systems are metal poor with
[Fe/H] < -1.35 and old, with ages > 5 Gyr at 3 sigma confidence, placing their
formation at z >1. This is one of the first spectroscopic studies of globular
clusters surrounding dwarfs in a cluster, revealing that some low mass galaxies
in rich environments form at least part of their stellar mass early in the
history of the universe. We further find that the luminosity weighted stellar
population of VCC 1386 itself is younger, and more metal rich than its globular

This implies that VCC 1386, like Local Group dEs, has had multiple episodes of

  II. The Effect of Smooth Cloud Boundaries on Cloud Destruction and Cloud
  Turbulence","62 pages, 16 figures, submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/501530",,"astro-ph",,"  The effect of smooth cloud boundaries on the interaction of steady planar
shock waves with interstellar clouds is studied using a high-resolution local
AMR technique with a second-order accurate axisymmetric Godunov hydrodynamic
scheme. A 3D calculation is also done to confirm the results of the 2D ones. We
consider an initially spherical cloud whose density distribution is flat near
the cloud center and has a power-law profile in the cloud envelope. When an
incident shock is transmitted into a smooth cloud, velocity gradients in the
cloud envelope steepen the smooth density profile at the upstream side,
resulting in a sharp density jump having an arc-like shape. Such a ``slip
surface'' forms immediately when a shock strikes a cloud with a sharp boundary.
For smoother boundaries, the formation of slip surface and therefore the onset
of hydrodynamic instabilities are delayed. Since the slip surface is subject to
the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the shocked cloud is
eventually destroyed in $\sim 3-10$ cloud crushing times. After complete cloud
destruction, small blobs formed by fragmentation due to hydrodynamic
instabilities have significant velocity dispersions of the order of 0.1 $v_b$,
where $v_b$ is the shock velocity in the ambient medium. This suggests that
turbulent motions generated by shock-cloud interaction are directly associated
with cloud destruction. The interaction of a shock with a cold HI cloud should
lead to the production of a spray of small HI shreds, which could be related to
the small cold clouds recently observed by Stanimirovic & Heiles (2005). The
linewidth-size relation obtained from our 3D simulation is found to be
time-dependent. A possibility for gravitational instability triggered by shock
compression is also discussed.

cosmology is that each bandpass be a redshifted copy of the first. We design

and inverse prominences (IPs), respectively. To test their theory, we employed
a two-dimensional, time-dependent, resistive magnetohydrodynamic code to
simulate the expulsion of CMEs in these two different prominence environments.
Our numerical simulations demonstrate that (i) a CME-like expulsion is more
readily produced in an NP than in an IP environment, and, (ii) a CME
originating from an NP environment tends to have a higher speed early in the
event than one originating from an IP environment. Magnetic reconnection plays
distinct roles in the two different field topologies of these two environments
to produce their characteristic CME speed-height profiles. Our numerical
simulations support the proposal of Low and Zhang (2002) although the
reconnection development for the NP associated CME is different from the one
sketched in their theory. Observational implications of our simulations are
discussed.

interpreted as the effect of galactic winds on the Intergalactic Medium. We use
here numerical simulations to investigate the flux probability function close
to plausible sites of LBGs. We show that the flux distribution near our LBGs in
the simulation depends strongly on redshift, and is very sensitive to the
averaging procedure. We show that a model without galactic winds and a model
with a wind bubble size of 0.5Mpc/h (comoving) are equally consistent with the
new determination of the conditional flux distribution by Adelberger et al.
(2005). Models with the larger bubble sizes suggested by the previous
observations of Adelberger et al. (2003) based on a much smaller sample at
higher redshift are not consistent with the new data. We therefore argue that
the volume filling factor of galactic winds driven by LBGs may be much smaller
than previously thought, and that most of the metals responsible for the metal
absorption associated with the low column density Lya forest are unlikely to
have been ejected by LBGs.

  Methods: Deep VLT/FORS1 spectra of lensed quasars are spatially deconvolved
in order to separate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the
much brighter quasar images. A new observing strategy is devised. It involves
observations in Multi-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) which allows the simultaneous
observation of the target and of several PSF and flux calibration stars. The
advantage of this method over traditional long-slit observations is a much more
reliable extraction and flux calibration of the spectra.
  Results: For the first time we measure the redshift of the lensing galaxy in
three multiply-imaged quasars: SDSS J1138+0314 (z=0.445), SDSS J1226-0006
(z=0.517), SDSS J1335+0118 (z=0.440), and we give a tentative estimate of the

the redshift of the second lensing galaxy in HE 0230-2130 (z=0.526). The
spectra of all lens galaxies are typical for early-type galaxies, except for
the second lensing galaxy in HE 0230-2130 which displays prominent [OII]

transient XTE J1550-564 as a specific example, and show that these have disc
spectra which are significantly lower in temperature than those seen from the
same source at the same luminosity when in the disc dominated state. If these
give a true picture of the disc then either the disc emissivity has reduced,
and/or the disc truncates above the last stable orbit. However, it is often
assumed that the tail is produced by Compton scattering, in which case its
shape in these spectra requires that the Comptonising region is marginally
optically thick (tau~2-3), and covers a large fraction of the inner disc. This
will distort our view of the disc. We build a theoretical model of a
Comptonising corona over an inner disc, and fit this to the data, but find that
it still requires a large increase in inner disc radius for a standard disc
emissivity. Instead it seems more probable that the disc emissivity changes in
the presence of the corona. We implement the specific inner disc-corona
coupling model of Svensson & Zdziarski (1994) and show that this can explain
the low temperature/high luminosity disc emission seen in the very high state
with only a small increase in radius of the disc. While this inferred disc
truncation is probably not significant given the model uncertainties, it is
consistent with the low frequency QPO and gives continuity of properties with
the low/hard state spectra.

An example is given of the deflexion or Frenet curvature of the elastic

Levi-Civita-Christoffel symbol of the Riemannian geometry. A second example is
the bending of a planar two-dimensional wall where only the horizontal lines of

In this case since the vertical lines are approximately not bent, and remain
vertical while the horizontal lines are slightly bent in the limit of small

Riemann curvature does not vanish and again may be expressed in terms of the
elastic properties of the planar wall. Non-Riemannian geometry in its own is

vertex corrections (CVC's) are correctly taken into account to satisfy the
conservation laws, which has been performed for the first time for optical
conductivities based on the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation. We find
that the CVC emphasizes the $\omega$-dependence of $\sigma_{xy}(\omega)$
significantly when the antiferromagnetic (AF) fluctuations are strong. By this
reason, the relation $\sigma_{xy}(\omega) \sim {\sigma(\omega)}^2$, which is
satisfied in the extended-Drude model given by the relaxation time
approximation (RTA), is totally violated for a wide range of frequencies.
Consequently, the optical Hall coefficient $R_H(\omega)$ strongly depends on
$\omega$ below the infrared frequencies, which is consistent with experimental
observations. We also study the mystery about a simple-Drude form of the
optical Hall angle $\theta_H(\omega)$ observed by Drew et al., which is highly
nontrivial in terms of the RTA since the strong $\omega$-dependence of the
relaxation time should modify the Drude-form. We find that a simple Drude-form
of $\theta_H(\omega)$ is realized because the $\omega$-dependence of the CVC
almost cancels that of the relaxation time. In conclusion, anomalous optical
transport phenomena in high-Tc superconductors, which had been frequently
assumed as an evidence of the breakdown of the Fermi liquid state, are well
understood in terms of the nearly AF Fermi liquid once the CVC is taken into

applicable to both cases where causal or non-causal side information is made

single user channel, the multiple access channel, the degraded broadcast
channel, and the degraded relay channel, the sum capacity with causal and
non-causal side information are identical when all the transmitter side
information is also made available to all the receivers. A genie-aided
outerbound is developed that states that when a genie provides $n$ bits of side
information to a receiver the resulting capacity improvement can not be more
than $n$ bits. Combining these two results we are able to bound the relative
capacity advantage of non-causal side information over causal side information
for both single user as well as various multiple user communication scenarios.
Applications of these capacity bounds are demonstrated through examples of
random access channels. Interestingly, the capacity results indicate that the
excessive MAC layer overheads common in present wireless systems may be avoided
through coding across multiple access blocks. It is also shown that even one
bit of side information at the transmitter can result in unbounded capacity
improvement. As a side, we obtain the sum capacity for a multiple access
channel when the side information available to the transmitter is causal and
possibly correlated to the side information available to the receiver.

one of a family of nonlinear objective functions, $\beta$-exponential means,

receipt in single-shot communications ($a<1$) and a previously known problem of
minimizing the chance of buffer overflow in a queueing system ($a>1$). This
paper introduces methods for finding codes optimal for such exponential means.
One method applies to geometric distributions, while another applies to
distributions with lighter tails. The latter algorithm is applied to Poisson
distributions and both are extended to alphabetic codes, as well as to
minimizing maximum pointwise redundancy. The aforementioned application of

inspirals of test-bodies into a Kerr black hole recently developed by
Glampedakis, Hughes and Kennefick. Their original ""hybrid"" scheme was based on
combining exact relativistic expressions for the evolution of the orbital
elements (the semi-latus rectum p and eccentricity e) with approximate,
weak-field, formula for the energy and angular momentum fluxes, amended by the
assumption of constant inclination angle, iota, during the inspiral. Despite
the fact that the resulting inspirals were overall well-behaved, certain
pathologies remained for orbits in the strong field regime and for orbits which
are nearly circular and/or nearly polar. In this paper we eliminate these
problems by incorporating an array of improvements in the approximate fluxes.
Firstly, we add certain corrections which ensure the correct behaviour of the
fluxes in the limit of vanishing eccentricity and/or 90 degrees inclination.
Secondly, we use higher order post-Newtonian formulae, adapted for generic
orbits. Thirdly, we drop the assumption of constant inclination. Instead, we
first evolve the Carter constant by means of an approximate post-Newtonian
expression and subsequently extract the evolution of iota. Finally, we improve
the evolution of circular orbits by using fits to the angular momentum and
inclination evolution determined by Teukolsky based calculations. As an
application of the improved scheme we provide a sample of generic Kerr
inspirals and for the specific case of nearly circular orbits we locate the
critical radius where orbits begin to decircularise under radiation reaction.
These easy-to-generate inspirals should become a useful tool for exploring LISA
data analysis issues and may ultimately play a role in source detection.

In this paper, we review the different phenomenological signatures of a
particular class of models, universal extra dimensions, where all matter fields
propagate in the bulk. Such models have interesting features, in particular
Kaluza-Klein (KK) number conservation, which makes their phenomenology similar
to that of supersymmetric theories. Thus, KK excitations of matter are produced
in pairs, and decay to a lightest KK particle (LKP), which is stable and weakly
interacting, and therefore will appear as missing energy in the detector
(similar to a neutralino LSP). Adding gravitational interactions which can
break KK number conservation greatly expands the class of possible signatures.
Thus, if gravity is the primary cause for the decay of KK excitations of
matter, the experimental signals at hadron colliders will be jets + missing
energy, which is typical of supergravity models. If the KK quarks and gluons
decay first to the LKP, which then decays gravitationally, the experimental
signal will be photons and/or leptons (with some jets), which resembles the
phenomenology of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models.

unified gauge group. The Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (ESSM)
considered here is based on the low energy SM gauge group together with an
extra $Z'$ corresponding to an extra $U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry under which
right--handed neutrinos have zero charge. The low energy matter content of the
ESSM corresponds to three 27 representations of the $E_6$ symmetry group, to
ensure anomaly cancellation, plus an additional pair of Higgs--like doublets as
required for high energy gauge coupling unification. The ESSM is therefore a
low energy alternative to the MSSM or NMSSM. The ESSM involves extra matter
beyond the MSSM contained in three $5+5^*$ representations of SU(5), plus three
SU(5) singlets which carry $U(1)_{N}$ charges, one of which develops a VEV,
providing the effective $\mu$ term for the Higgs doublets, as well as the
necessary exotic fermion masses. We explore the RG flow of the ESSM and examine
theoretical restrictions on the values of new Yukawa couplings caused by the
validity of perturbation theory up to the Grand Unification scale. We then
discuss electroweak symmetry breaking and Higgs phenomenology, and establish an
upper limit on the mass of the lightest Higgs particle which can be
significantly heavier than in the MSSM and NMSSM, in leading two--loop
approximation. We also discuss the phenomenology of the $Z'$ and the extra
matter, whose discovery will provide a smoking gun signal of the model.

corrections are accounted for whereever possible to date. Results are obtained
for a modified SPS1a MSSM benchmark scenario but they were checked not to
depend critically on this assumption. Exploiting a simulated annealing
algorithm, a stable result is obtained without any a priori assumptions on the
values of the fit parameters. Most of the Lagrangian parameters can be
extracted at the percent level or better if theoretical uncertainties are
neglected. Neither LHC nor ILC measurements alone will be sufficient to obtain
a stable result. The effects of theoretical uncertainties arising from unknown
higher-order corrections and parametric uncertainties are examined
qualitatively. They appear to be relevant and the result motivates further
precision calculations. The obtained parameters at the electroweak scale are
used for a fit of the parameters at high energy scales within the bottom-up
approach. In this way regularities at these scales are explored and the
underlying model can be determined with hardly any theoretical bias. Fits of
high-scale parameters to combined LHC+ILC measurements within the mSUGRA

handle cancellations) which transforms the given cobordism into the normal
form. Using the generators and relations description of the category of
open-closed cobordisms, we show that it is equivalent to the symmetric monoidal

to weak completeness, and of front to p-front. As a front is a p-front and
completeness implies weak completeness, the new framework and results here
apply to a more general class of flat surfaces.
  This more general class contains the caustics of flat fronts -- shown also to
be flat by Roitman (who gave a holomorphic representation formula for them) --
which are an important class of surfaces and are generally not complete but
only weakly complete. Furthermore, although flat fronts have globally defined
normals, caustics might not, making them flat fronts only locally, and hence
only p-fronts. Using the new framework, we obtain characterizations for
caustics.

2) experimentally last year, that a pulse of light, entered into an atomic
caesium (Cs) vapour cell, appeared at the exit before its entrance (!) by 62
nanoseconds. It has to be mentioned that the shape of the pulse was maintained
(cf. fig. 4 of 1), so that its peak was not shifted forward inside the pulse.
Thus the explanation that the peak of the pulse was advanced at the exit, with
the result of emerging there before the entrance of the peak of the incident
pulse, does not apply.

$C=0.81$ are obtained, which agree with the simulation results approximately.

the relative permeability r is not equal to unity. We have designed an array of
split-ring resonators as a metamaterial with mu_r 1 using a finite-difference

freedom, i.e. rotations about the long axes of molecules, may be important in
determining the structure of the assemblies especially when the interaction
energy between neighbouring molecules explicitly depends on their relative
azimuthal orientations. For DNA this leads to a rich variety of mesophases for
columnar assemblies, each categorized by a specific azimuthal ordering. In a
preceding paper [A. Wynveen, D. J. Lee, and A. A. Kornyshev, Eur. Phys. J. E,
16, 303 (2005)] a statistical mechanical theory was developed for the
assemblies of torsionally rigid molecues in order to determine how thermal
fluctuations influence the structure of these mesophases. Here we extend this
theory by including torsional fluctuations of the molecules, where a DNA
molecule may twist about its long axis at the cost of torsional elastic energy.
Comparing this with the previous study, we find that inclusion of torsional
fluctuations further increases the density at which the transition between the
hexagonal structure and the predicted rhombic phase occurs and reduces the
level of distortion in the rhombic phase. As X-ray diffraction may probe the
2-D lattice structure of such assemblies and provide information concerning the
underlying interaction between molecules, we have also calculated correlation
functions for the azimuthal ordering which are manifest in an x-ray scattering
intensity profiles.

solution problems originated by conflicting or cooperative behaviors among the
members of a system from the point of view of quantum mechanical interactions.
The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is the equation of evolution of
mixed states from quantum statistical mechanics. A system and all its members
will cooperate and rearrange its states to improve their present condition.
They strive to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the
best possible state for the whole system. This led us to propose a quantum
equilibrium in which a system is stable only if it maximizes the welfare of the
collective above the welfare of the individual. If it is maximized the welfare
of the individual above the welfare of the collective the system gets unstable
and eventually it collapses.
