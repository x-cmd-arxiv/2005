greater than (gamma/2). Here, <v_r^2> and <v_T^2> are the radial and tangential
velocity second moments. This follows from the non-negativity of the phase
space density. We compare this theorem to other proposed relations between the
cusp slope and the central anisotropy to clarify their applicabilities and
underlying assumptions. The extension of this theorem to tracer populations in
an externally imposed potential is also derived. In particular, for stars
moving in the vicinity of a central black hole, this reduces to gamma >=
beta+(1/2), indicating that an isotropic system in Keplerian potential should
be cusped at least as steep as 1/r^{0.5}. Similar limits have been noticed
before for specific forms of the distribution function, but here we establish
this as a general result.

light. Moreover, this effect may be derived from the simplest

to be a good late time model of our own universe.

and revise the calculations in terms of observable quantities which are
coordinate independent. By this method we see that, although such a tethering
would reduce the redshift of a receding object, it would not do so sufficiently
to cause the proposed blueshift. The effect is also demonstrated to be much
smaller than conjectured below the largest intergalactic scales. We also
discuss some important issues, raised by this scenario, relating to the
interpretation of redshift and distance in relativistic cosmology.

too far from its host star. We find that instability boundaries first obtained
in numerical studies can be explained by overlap between sub-resonances within
mean-motion resonances (mostly of the j:1 type). Strong secular forcing from
the companion displaces the centroids of different sub-resonances, producing
large regions of resonance overlap. Planets lying within these overlapping
regions experience chaotic diffusion, which in most cases leads to their
eventual ejection. The overlap region extends to shorter-period orbits as
either the companion's mass or its eccentricity increase. Our analytical
calculations reproduce the instability boundaries observed in numerical studies
and yield the following two additional results. Firstly, the instability
boundary as a function of eccentricity is jagged; thus, the widest stable orbit
could be reduced from previously quoted values by as much as 20%. Secondly,
very high order resonances (e.g., 50:3) do not significantly modify the
instability boundary despite the fact that these weak resonances can produce
slow chaotic diffusion which may be missed by finite-duration numerical
integrations. We present some numerical evidence for the first result. More
extensive experiments are called for to confirm these conclusions. For the
special case of circular binaries, we find that the Hill criterion (based on
the critical Jacobi integral) yields an instability boundary that is very
similar to that obtained by resonance overlap arguments, making the former both
a necessary and a sufficient condition for planet instability.

(RMS) survey in the fourth Galactic quadrant. HI data from the Southern
Galactic Plane Survey (SPGS) was used in conjunction with the HI
self-absorption technique to determine the near or far distance. We resolved
the kinematic distance ambiguity to 70% of the sources. We can also
simultaneously solve for any multiple line-of-sight component sources. We
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this technique in comparison with
other methods, and also perform confidence checks on the reliability of using
the HI self-absorption technique. We examined the projected location of these
sources in both the Galactic plane and longitude-velocity diagrams to ascertain
any recognisable spiral arm pattern. Although no obvious spiral pattern was
found when compared to that proposed by Cordes & Lazio, far distance sources
tended to lie on or near spiral arm loci. Near distance sources, however, had
peculiar velocity uncertainties consistent with the separation between the
spiral arms themselves. The longitude-velocity plot shows a more consistent
picture, with tangent points of the spiral arm loci easily seen. We conclude
that using the HI self-absorption technique to determine kinematic distance
ambiguities is a quick and reliable method in most cases, with an 80% success
rate in determining the correct designation of whether an object is at the near

detected by INTEGRAL close to the Galactic plane and GRB040624 at high Galactic
latitude. Analyses of the prompt emission detected by the IBIS instrument on
INTEGRAL are presented for both bursts. The two GRBs have long durations, slow
pulses and are weak. The gamma-ray spectra of both bursts are best fit with
steep power-laws, implying they are X-ray rich. GRB040223 is among the weakest
and longest of INTEGRAL GRBs. The X-ray afterglow of this burst was detected 10
hours after the prompt event by XMM-Newton. The measured spectral properties
are consistent with a column density much higher than that expected from the
Galaxy, indicating strong intrinsic absorption. We carried out near-infrared
observations 17 hours after the burst with the NTT of ESO, which yielded upper
limits. Given the intrinsic absorption, we find that these limits are
compatible with a simple extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow properties. For
GRB040624, we carried out optical observations 13 hours after the burst with
FORS 1 and 2 at the VLT, and DOLoRes at the TNG, again obtaining upper limits.
We compare these limits with the magnitudes of a compilation of promptly
observed counterparts of previous GRBs and show that they lie at the very faint
end of the distribution. These two bursts are good examples of a population of
bursts with dark or faint afterglows that are being unveiled through the
increasing usage of large diameter telescopes engaged in comprehensive
observational programmes.

of galaxies A0262, A0496, A1060, A2199, A3158 and A3558. Given the dominance of
dark matter in galaxy clusters we approximate their total density distribution
by the NFW formula characterized by virial mass and concentration. We also
assume that the anisotropy of galactic orbits is reasonably well described by a
constant and that galaxy distribution traces that of the total density. Using
the velocity and position data for 120-420 galaxies per cluster we calculate,
after removal of interlopers, the profiles of the lowest-order even velocity
moments, dispersion and kurtosis. We then reproduce the velocity moments by
jointly fitting the moments to the solutions of the Jeans equations. Including
the kurtosis in the analysis allows us to break the degeneracy between the mass
distribution and anisotropy and constrain the anisotropy as well as the virial
mass and concentration. The method is tested in detail on mock data extracted
from N-body simulations of dark matter haloes. We find that the best-fitting
galactic orbits are remarkably close to isotropic in most clusters. Using the
fitted pairs of mass and concentration parameters for the six clusters we
conclude that the trend of decreasing concentration for higher masses found in
cosmological N-body simulations is consistent with the data. By scaling the
individual cluster data by mass we combine them to create a composite cluster
with 1465 galaxies and perform a similar analysis on such sample. The estimated
concentration parameter then lies in the range 1.5 < c < 14 and the anisotropy
parameter in the range -1.1 < \beta < 0.5 at the 95 percent confidence level.

and Coulomb interaction $U$ on the compressibility are studied carefully. It
has been found that the compressibility diverges and then it becomes negative
near the half-filling. Within Roth's method, it has been verified that an
important contribution for the negative compressibility comes from the
spin-correlation term $<S_j^+S_i^->$ present in Roth's band shift. This

Also, its effects in the band shift and consequently in the compressibility are
pronounced near the half-filling. The numerical results show that the

pseudospin representation of the SC and CDW order parameters. One important
feature in the effective nonlinear $\sigma$ model is the emergence of Berry
phase even at half filling, originating from the competition between SC and
CDWs, i.e., the pseudospin symmetry. A well known conflict between the previous
studies of Oshikawa\cite{Oshikawa} and D. H. Lee et al.\cite{DHLee} is resolved
by the appearance of Berry phase. The Berry phase contribution allows a
deconfined quantum critical point of fractionalized charge excitations with $e$
instead of $2e$ in the SC-CDW quantum transition at half filling. Furthermore,
we investigate the stability of the deconfined quantum criticality against
quenched randomness by performing a renormalization group analysis of an
effective vortex action. We argue that although randomness results in a weak
disorder fixed point differing from the original deconfined quantum critical
point, deconfinement of the fractionalized charge excitations still survives at
the disorder fixed point owing to a nonzero fixed point value of a vortex
charge.

self-consistent field (SCF) calculation. The diagonal matrix element of the
Hamiltonian leads to a shift of the center of gravity of the conduction band
while the off-diagonal matrix elements result in a small reduction of the
conduction-electron band width. This calculation is supplemented by the
computation of the loss of ground state correlations due to the blocked Wannier
orbital into which the added electron has been placed. The same procedure
applies to the removal of an electron, i.e., to the valence bands. But the
latter have been calculated previously in some detail and previous results are
used in order to estimate the energy gap in the two materials. The numerical

tree-approximations to the dependency structure of an unknown distribution
generating data. The traditional approach to the problem measures the
dependency strength between random variables by the index called mutual
information. In this paper reliability is achieved by Walley's imprecise
Dirichlet model, which generalizes Bayesian learning with Dirichlet priors.
Adopting the imprecise Dirichlet model results in posterior interval
expectation for mutual information, and in a set of plausible trees consistent
with the data. Reliable inference about the actual tree is achieved by focusing
on the substructure common to all the plausible trees. We develop an exact
algorithm that infers the substructure in time O(m^4), m being the number of
random variables. The new algorithm is applied to a set of data sampled from a
known distribution. The method is shown to reliably infer edges of the actual
tree even when the data are very scarce, unlike the traditional approach.
Finally, we provide lower and upper credibility limits for mutual information
under the imprecise Dirichlet model. These enable the previous developments to
be extended to a full inferential method for trees.

This is possible because the formation process involves recombination of charm

quarks. We have contrasted the transverse momentum spectra of J/Psi,
characterized by <p_T^2>, which result from the formation process in which the
charm quark distributions are taken at opposite limits with regard to
thermalization in the medium. The first uses charm quark distributions
unchanged from their initial production in a pQCD process, appropriate if their
interaction with the medium is negligible. The second uses charm quark
distributions which are in complete thermal equilibrium with the transversely
expanding medium, appropriate if a very strong interaction between charm quarks
and medium exists. We find that the resulting <p_T^2> of the formed J/Psi
should allow one to differentiate between these extremes, and that this
differentiation is not sensitive to variations in the detailed dynamics of
in-medium formation. We include a comparison of predictions of this model with
preliminary PHENIX measurements, which indicates compatibility with a
substantial fraction of in-medium formation.

narrow since they can decay only via OZI-violating processes. A narrow nucleon
resonance is found at mass 3.52 GeV. It is a coupled-channel bound state of the

  Within the proposed reduction scheme there is a natural possibility to
introduce Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. In the reduced systems, such terms give rise
to potential terms, and in some cases also to terms describing the interaction
with a magnetic field.
  We demonstrate that known N=4 superconformal actions, together with their
possible interactions, appear as results of the reduction from a free action
for the ``root'' supermultiplet. As a byproduct, we also construct an N=4
supersymmetric action for the linear (3,4,1) supermultiplet, containing both an
interaction with a Dirac monopole and a harmonic oscillator-type potential,
generalized for arbitrary conformally flat metrics.

We find various mesonic branches of the moduli space whose string duals involve
the warped deformed conifold with different numbers of mobile D3-branes. The
branes that are not mobile form a BPS bound state at threshold. In the special
case where p is divisible by M there also exists a one-dimensional baryonic
branch whose family of supergravity duals, the resolved warped deformed
conifolds, was constructed recently. The warped deformed conifold is a special
case of these backgrounds where the resolution parameter vanishes and a Z_2
symmetry is restored. We study various brane probes on the resolved warped
deformed conifolds, and successfully match the results with the gauge theory.
In particular, we show that the radial potential for a D3-brane on this space
varies slowly, suggesting a new model of D-brane inflation.

  We consider the problem of computing the global infimum of a real polynomial
in several variables. Every global minimizer lies on the gradient variety. If
the polynomial attains a minimum, it is therefore equivalent to look for the
greatest lower bound on its gradient variety. Nie, Demmel and Sturmfels proved
recently a theorem about the existence of sums of squares certificates for such
lower bounds. Based on these certificates, they find arbitrarily tight
relaxations of the original problem that can be formulated as semidefinite
programs and thus be solved efficiently.
  We deal here with the more general case when the polynomial is bounded from
belo w but does not necessarily attain a minimum. In this case, the method of
Nie, Demmel and Sturmfels might yield completely wrong results. In order to
overcome this problem, we replace the gradient variety by larger semialgebraic
sets which we call gradient tentacles. It now gets substantially harder to
prove the existence of the necessary sums of squares certificates.

corresponding functionals are of Blake-Zisserman type. Their natural
counterpart in continuous time are the Mumford-Shah functionals. Time series
which minimise these functionals are proper estimates or representations of the
signals behind recorded data. We focus on consistent behaviour of the
functionals and the estimates, as parameters vary or as the sampling rate
increases. For each time continuous time series $f\in L^2 (\lbrack 0,1\rbrack)$
we take conditional expectations w.r.t. to $\sigma$-algebras generated by finer
and finer partitions of the time domain into intervals, and thereby construct a
sequence $(f_n)_{n\in\N}$ of discrete time series. As $n$ increases this
amounts to sampling the continuous time series with more and more accuracy. Our
main result is consistent behaviour of segmentations w.r.t. to variation of
parameters and increasing sampling rate.

existence of this moment would explain known anomalies in the internal
conversion coefficients for $M1$ transitions in nuclei. We show also that the
static cyclo-toroid nuclear moment interacts locally inside the nucleus with
the vortex part of the atomic electron currents and this leads to an energy
shift in atomic $s_{1/2}$ states. For the hydrogen atom the value of this shift
may be comparable in order of magnitude to the present accuracy of measurements

from clear. We explore this question using an agent-based model inspired by the
fission-fusion society of Spider monkeys (Ateles spp). Our model introduces a
realistic, complex foraging environment composed of many resource patches with
size varying according to an inverse power-law frequency distribution with
exponent $\beta$. Foragers do not interact among them and start from random
initial locations. They have either a complete or partial knowledge of the
environment and maximize the ratio between the size of the next visited patch
and the distance traveled to it, ignoring previously visited patches. At
intermediate values of $\beta$, when large patches are neither too scarce nor
too abundant, foragers form groups (coincide at the same patch) with a similar
size frequency distribution as the spider monkey's subgroups. Fission-fusion
events create a network of associations that contains weak bonds among foragers
that meet only rarely and strong bonds among those that repeat associations
more frequently than would be expected by chance. The latter form sub-networks
with the highest number of bonds and a high clustering coefficient at
intermediate values of $\beta$. The weak bonds enable the whole social network
to percolate. Some of our results are similar to those found in long-term field
studies of spider monkeys and other fission-fusion species. We conclude that
hypotheses about the ecological causes of fission-fusion and the origin of
complex social structures should consider the heterogeneity and complexity of
the environment in which social animals live.

implementation of high cross-Kerr nonlinearity in cavity-quantum
electrodynamics. In this context, we discuss the possibility of performing
entanglement transfer and swapping between a qubit and a continuous-variable
state. The recently introduced concept of entanglement reciprocation is also
considered and shown to be possible with our scheme. We reinterpret some of our
results in terms of applications of a generalized Ising interaction to systems
of different nature.

product of the elementary displacements equals Planck's constant. Then, their
common eigenstates constitute the Zak basis, each state specified by two phase
parameters. Upon enforcing a periodic dependence on the phases, one gets a
one-to-one mapping of the Hilbert space on the line onto the Hilbert space on
the torus. The Fourier coefficients of the periodic Zak bases make up the
discrete Zak bases. The two bases are mutually unbiased. We study these bases
in detail, including a brief discussion of their relation to Aharonov's modular
operators, and mention how they can be used to associate with the single degree
of freedom of the line a pair of genuine qubits.

2-particle electrodynamics, using the full electrodynamic force obtained from
the retarded Lienard-Wiechert potentials and the Lorentz force law. In
contrast, the usual formulation uses only the Coulomb force (scalar potential),
reducing the electrodynamic 2-body problem to a system of ordinary differential
equations (ODE's). The ODE formulation is mathematically suspect since FDE's
and ODE's are known to be incompatible; however, the Coulomb approximation to
the full electrodynamic force has been believed to be adequate for physics. We
can now test this long-standing belief by comparing the FDE solution with the
ODE solution, in the historically interesting case of the classical hydrogen
atom. The solutions differ.
  A key qualitative difference is that the full force involves a `delay'
torque. Our existing code is inadequate to calculate the detailed interaction
of the delay torque with radiative damping. However, a symbolic calculation
provides conditions under which the delay torque approximately balances (3rd
order) radiative damping. Thus, further investigations are required, and it was
prematurely concluded that radiative damping makes the classical hydrogen atom
unstable. Solutions of FDE's naturally exhibit an_infinite_ spectrum of
_discrete_ frequencies. The conclusion is that (a) the Coulomb force is_not_ a
valid approximation to the full electrodynamic force, so that (b) the n-body
interaction needs to be reformulated in various current contexts such as
molecular dynamics.
