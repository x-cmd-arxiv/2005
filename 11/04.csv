atmosphere could be observed. Time profiles of the three lines and the
underlying continuum indicate distinct phases with several emission peaks and
varying continuum-to-line ratio for several minutes before a smoother decay
phase sets in. Due to the high-resolution Ge detectors of SPI and the
exceptional intensity of the flare, detailed studies of the 4.4 and 6.1 MeV
line shapes was possible for the first time. Comparison with calculated line
shapes using a thick target interaction model and several energetic particle
angular distributions indicates that the nuclear interactions were induced by
downward-directed particle beams with alpha-to-proton ratios of the order of
0.1. There are also indications that the 4.4 MeV to 6.1 MeV line fluence ratio
changed between the beginning and the decay phase of the flare, possibly due to
a temporal evolution of the energetic particle alpha-to-proton ratio.

(higher than 21,000K) of the K 4-47's core and the N overabundance of the outer
knots in NGC 7009 are real.
  These are very basic parameters, obtained for Galactic PNe, e.g. nearby
objects, even though with large uncertainties. Based on the comparison of the
modelling with, mainly, optical images and long-slit spectroscopic data, it is
suggested here that K 4-47 high Te can be explained if its core is composed of
a very dense and small inner region --that matches the radio measurements-- and
a lower density outer core --matching the optical observations. This approach
can account for the strong auroral emission lines [OIII]4363A and [NII]5755A
observed, and so for the high temperatures. This teaches us that the assumption
of a homogeneous distribution of the gas is completely wrong for the core of
such PN.
  In the case of NGC 7009 a simple 3D model that reproduces the observed
geometry of this nebula is constructed. The aim of this modelling was to
explore the possibility that the enhanced [NII] emission observed in the outer
knots may be due to ionisation effects instead to a local N overabundance. Here
it is discussed the model that can best reproduce the observations employing a
homogeneous set of abundances throughout the nebula, not only for nitrogen but
also for all the other elements considered.

arise from a cool disk as its blackbody temperature is similar in three
XMM-Newton observations, despite a change in the observed flux by a factor of
about two. Thus, previous estimates of the black hole mass of 1000Msun for
NGC1313 X-1 based on the temperature of the soft excess emission is unlikely to
be correct. The power-law cutoff energy is found to decrease from ~8keV to

similar in structure to NGC 7009 with its outer pair of knots (also known as
FLIERs --fast, low-ionization emission regions). The work is motivated by the
fact that the strong [N II]6583A line emission from FLIERs in many planetary
nebulae has been attributed to a significant local overabundance of nitrogen.
We explore the possibility that the apparent enhanced nitrogen abundance
previously reported in the FLIERs may be due to ionization effects. Our model
is indeed able to reproduce the main spectroscopic and imaging characteristics
of NGC 7009's bright inner rim and its outer pairs of knots, assuming
homogeneous elemental abundances throughout the nebula, for nitrogen as well as
all the other elements included in the model. Because of the fact that the
(N+/N)/(O+/O) ratio predicted by our models are 0.60 for the rim and 0.72 for
the knots, so clearly in disagreement with the N+/N=O+/O assumption of the
ionization correction factors method (icf), the icfs will be underestimated by
the empirical scheme, in both components, rim and knots, but more so in the
knots. This effect is partly responsible for the apparent inhomogeneous N
abundance empirically derived. The differences in the above ratio in these two
components of the nebula may be due to a number of effects including charge
exchange --as pointed out previously by other authors-- and the difference in
the ionization potentials of the relevant species --which makes this ratio
extremely sensitive to the shape of the local radiation field. Because of the
latter, a realistic density distribution is essential to the modelling of a
non-spherical object, if useful information is to be extracted from spatially
resolved observations, as in the case of NGC 7009.

mCrab) in the 20-60 keV energy band. A follow-up observation with XMM-Newton,

2MASS J17251139-3616575, which has a Ks-band magnitude of 10.7 and is located
1"" away from the XMM-Newton position.
  The analysis of the combined INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations shows that
the source is a binary X-ray pulsar with a spin period of 413.7 s and an
orbital period of 9.72 days. The spectrum can be fitted with a flat power law
plus an energy cut off (Gamma~0.02,Ecut~8.2 keV) or a Comptonized model
(kTe~5.5 keV, tau~7.8). The spectrum also indicates a large hydrogen column
density of Nh~15x1e22 atoms/cm-2 suggesting an intrinsic absorption. The Fe
Kalpha line at 6.4 keV is clearly detected. Phase-resolved spectroscopy does
not show any variation in the continuum except the total emitted flux. The
absorption is constant along the pulse phase. This source can be associated
with EXO 1722-363 as both systems show common timing and spectral features. The

driven by a large AGN. However, in the more tenuous low-redshift IGM,
equivalently strong feedback can be achieved by less energetic winds (and thus
smaller galaxies). Using a simple analytic model, we show that this leads to
the anti-hierarchical quenching of star-formation in large galaxies, consistent
with current observations. At redshifts prior to the formation of large AGN,
galaxy formation is hierarchical and follows the growth of dark-matter halos.

and metallicities lower than the comparable field galaxies. Our results provide
strong observational evidence for a merger scenario where galaxy interactions
cause gas flows towards the central regions, carrying less enriched gas from
the outskirts of the galaxy into the central regions. The less enriched gas
dilutes the pre-existing nuclear gas to produce a lower metallicity than would
be obtained prior to the interaction. These gas flows trigger central bursts of
star formation, causing strong central burst strengths, and possibly aiding the
formation of blue bulges. We show that the timescale and central gas dilution

Binaries. In our view, these central regions have a multi-flow configuration
which consists in (1) an outer standard accretion disc down to a transition
radius r_J, (2) an inner magnetized accretion disc below r_J driving (3) a non
relativistic self-collimated electron-proton jet surrounding, when adequate
conditions for pair creation are met, (4) a ultra relativistic
electron-positron beam. This accretion-ejection paradigm provides a simple
explanation to the canonical spectral states by varying the transition radius
r_J and disc accretion rate independently. Large values of r_J correspond to
the Quiescent state for low $\dot m$ and the Hard state for larger $\dot m$.
These states are characterized by the presence of a steady electron-proton MHD
jet emitted by the disc below r_J. The hard X-ray component is expected to form
at the jet basis. When r_j becomes smaller than the marginally stable orbit
r_i, the whole disc resembles a standard accretion disc, characteristic of the
Soft state. Intermediate states correspond to situations where r_J ~ r_i. At
large $\dot m$, an unsteady pair cascade process is triggered within the jet
axis, giving birth to ejection of relativistic pair blobs. This would
correspond to the luminous intermediate state, with its associated superluminal
motions. The variation of r_J independently of $\dot m$ is a necessary

spectra are often considered an alternative to template libraries of observed

attention in published theoretical spectral libraries has been devoted to the
visual wavelength range. We present a detailed comparison of theoretical
spectra in the range 1.57-1.67$\mu$m, for spectral types from A to early M and
for giants and dwarf stars, with observed stellar spectra at resolutions around
3000, which would be sufficient to disentangle the different groups of late
type stars. We have selected the NeMo grids of stellar atmospheres to perform
such a comparison. We first demonstrate that after combining atomic and
molecular line lists, it is possible to match observed spectral flux
distributions with theoretical ones very well for almost the entire parameter
range covered by the NeMo grids at moderate resolution in the visual range. In
the infrared range, although the overall shape of the observed flux
distributions is still matched reasonably well, the individual spectral
features are reproduced by the theoretical spectra only for stars earlier than
mid F type. For later spectral types the differences increase and theoretical
spectra of K type stars have systematically weaker line features than those
found in observations. These discrepancies are traced back to stem primarily
from incomplete data on neutral atomic lines, although some of them are also
related to molecules. Improving atomic data in the near infrared is a key
element in making the construction of reliable libraries of stellar spectra in
the infrared feasible.

attempts to look for gravity modes and the results obtained after 8 years of
observation with the GOLF/SoHO instrument. Some gravity mode candidates (at
1mm/s level) have appeared with more than 98% confidence level as quadruplets

result, we also observe significant, flux related spectral variations as well.
The flux-spectral relation is rather complicated, with loop-like structures
forming during the flux evolution. The presence of spectral variations imply
that the observed variability is not caused by geometric effects. On the other

CL01 method which is based on grids of photo-ionization models and on the
fitting of emission lines. For most galaxies, we have been able to solve the

branches of the O/H vs. $R\_{\mathrm{23}}$ relationship using various secondary
indicators. The luminosity -- metallicity ($L-Z$) relation has been derived in
the $B$- and $R$-bands, with metallicities derived with the two methods
($R\_{\mathrm{23}}$ and CL01). In the analysis, we first consider our sample
alone and then a larger one which includes other samples of
intermediate-redshift galaxies drawn from the literature. The derived $L-Z$
relations at intermediate redshifts are very similar (same slope) to the $L-Z$
relation obtained for the local universe. Our sample alone only shows a small
evolution of the $L-Z$ relation with redshift up to $z\sim1.0$. We only find
statistical variations consistent with the uncertainty in the derived
parameters. Including other samples of intermediate-redshift galaxies, we find
however that galaxies at $z\sim1$ appear to be metal-deficient by a factor of
$\sim3$ compared with galaxies in the local universe. For a given luminosity,
they contain on average about one third of the metals locked in local galaxies.

investigate polymer blend dynamics with Monte Carlo simulations of a
generalized bond-fluctuation model, where differences in the interaction
energies between non-bonded nearest neighbors distinguish the two components of
a blend. Simulations employing only local moves and respecting a non-bond
crossing condition were carried out for blends with a range of compositions,
densities, and chain lengths. The blends investigated here have long-chain
dynamics in the crossover region between Rouse and entangled behavior. In order
to investigate the scaling of the self-diffusion coefficients, characteristic
chain lengths $N_\mathrm{c}$ are calculated from the packing length of the
chains. These are combined with a local mobility $\mu$ determined from the
acceptance rate and the effective bond length to yield characteristic
self-diffusion coefficients $D_\mathrm{c}=\mu/N_\mathrm{c}$. We find that the
data for both melts and blends collapse onto a common line in a graph of
reduced diffusion coefficients $D/D_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of reduced chain
length $N/N_\mathrm{c}$. The composition dependence of dynamic properties is
investigated in detail for melts and blends with chains of length twenty at
three different densities. For these blends, we calculate friction coefficients
from the local mobilities and consider their composition and pressure
dependence. The friction coefficients determined in this way show many of the

quantum dot arrays with a disordered background potential. One effect of the
disorder is that conduction through the array is possible only for voltages
across the array that exceed a critical voltage $V_T$. We investigate the
behavior of arrays in three voltage regimes: below, at and above the critical
voltage. For voltages less than $V_T$, we find that the features of the
invasion of charge onto the array depend on whether the dots have uniform or
varying capacitances. We compute the first conduction path at voltages just
above $V_T$ using a transfer-matrix style algorithm. It can be used to
elucidate the important energy and length scales. We find that the geometrical
structure of the first conducting path is essentially unaffected by the
addition of capacitive or tunneling resistance disorder. We also investigate
the effects of this added disorder to transport further above the threshold. We
use finite size scaling analysis to explore the nonlinear current-voltage
relationship near $V_T$. The scaling of the current $I$ near $V_T$,
$I\sim(V-V_T)^{\beta}$, gives similar values for the effective exponent $\beta$
for all varieties of tunneling and capacitive disorder, when the current is
computed for voltages within a few percent of threshold. We do note that the
value of $\beta$ near the transition is not converged at this distance from
threshold and difficulties in obtaining its value in the $V\searrow V_T$ limit.

by varying the ratio gamma = a_S/a_L of lengths of the short a_S and the long

peaks related to the Fibonacci sequence are most pronounced when gamma is equal

remarkable self-similarity. This effect is demonstrated both in real space and
in reciprocal k-space. In 2D QP pinning arrays (e.g., Penrose lattices), the
pinning of vortices is related to matching conditions between the vortex
lattice and the QP lattice of pinning centers. Although more subtle to analyze
than in 1D pinning chains, the structure in J_c(Phi) is determined by the
presence of two different kinds of elements forming the 2D QP lattice. Indeed,
we predict analytically and numerically the main features of J_c(Phi) for
Penrose lattices. Comparing the J_c's for QP (Penrose), periodic (triangular)

temperature which leads to an increase of the steric hindrance of the

sensitivity on $\lambda$, $\lambda '$. For most $(\ell,m)$, there is a two-step
relaxation process, but practically not for $(\ell,m) = (2,1)$, $(3,2)$,
$(4,1)$ and $(4,3)$. Our results are consistent with the $\alpha$-relaxation
scaling laws predicted by mode coupling theory from which we deduce the glass
transition temperature $T_c^{MD} \cong 217K$. From a first principle solution

coupling theory reproduces the absence of a two-step relaxation process for

nonergodicity parameters by about 50 per cent for all other $(\ell,m)$. It is
suggested that this underestimation originates from the anisotropic crystal

Debye relaxation processes, connected with two chevron slabs, on opposite sides

microscopic observations of zigzag defects at different frequencies and
amplitudes of the external electric field, it is shown that, at low
frequencies, the electro-optic response of chevron samples is determined by
three kinds of motions of zigzag walls. The first two dynamic categories are
related to collective relaxation processes at weak fields, within smectic A

confirmed. A drastic change in the p variation of the Neel temperature (Tn) is
observed at 3 GPa. In the metallic phase (p>3 GPa), Tn is found to increase
linearly with p. A similar linear p increase of Tn is observed for the
quasitrivalent compound TmS which is at ambiant pressure equivalent to TmSe at
p=7 GPa. In the case of SmB6 long range magnetism has been detected above p=8
GPa, i.e. at a pressure slightly higher than the pressure of the insulator to

GPa. The magnetic and electronic properties are related to the renormalization
of the 4f wavefunction either to the divalent or the trivalent configurations.

Johnson-Segalman fluid, with and without the addition of stress diffusion to
regularise the equations. In particular, we investigate the effect of
two-dimensional perturbations representing undulations along the interface
between shear bands. We demonstrate analytically that, for the linear stability
problem, the limit in which diffusion tends to zero is mathematically
equivalent to a pure (non-diffusive) Johnson-Segalman model with a material
interface between the shear bands, provided the wavelength of perturbations
being considered is long relative to the (short) diffusion lengthscale.
  For no diffusion, we find that the flow is unstable to long waves for almost
all arrangements of the two shear bands. Weak diffusion provides a small
stabilising effect, rendering extremely long waves marginally stable. However,
the basic long-wave instability mechanism is not affected by this, and where
there would be instability as wavenumber k tends to 0 in the absence of
diffusion, we observe instability for moderate to long waves even with
diffusion.
  This paper is the first full analytical investigation into an instability
first documented in the numerical study of Physical Review Letters 95 (2005)

additional insight into the origin of this phenomenon through its manifestation

observed in many manganites in the ferromagnetic (FM), colossal

years, this task was usually approached in the frame of Treisman's two-stage

of preliminary information pieces gathering at the lower processing stages and
a supervised, top-down directed process of information pieces binding and
grouping at the higher stages. It is acknowledged that these sub-processes
interact and intervene between them in a tricky and a complicated manner.
Notwithstanding the prevalence of this paradigm in biological and computer
vision, we nevertheless propose to replace it with a new one, which we would
like to designate as a two-part paradigm. In it, information contained in an
image is initially extracted in an independent top-down manner by one part of
the system, and then it is examined and interpreted by another, separate system
part. We argue that the new paradigm seems to be more plausible than its
forerunner. We provide evidence from human attention vision studies and
insights of Kolmogorov's complexity theory to support our arguments. We also
provide some reasons in favor of separate image interpretation issues.

using gravitational lensing by compact objects to test different theories of
gravity beyond the weak-deflection limit. In this paper we present the
formalism for computing corrections to lensing observables for static,
spherically symmetric gravity theories in which the corrections to the
weak-deflection limit can be expanded as a Taylor series in one parameter,
namely the gravitational radius of the lens object. We take care to derive
coordinate-independent expressions and compute quantities that are directly
observable. We compute first- and second-order corrections to the image
positions, magnifications, and time delays. Interestingly, we find that the
first-order corrections to the total magnification and centroid position vanish
in all gravity theories that agree with general relativity in the
weak-deflection limit, but they can remain nonzero in modified theories that
disagree with GR in the weak-deflection limit. For the Reissner-Nordstrom
metric and a related metric from heterotic string theory, our formalism reveals
an intriguing connection between lensing observables and the condition for
having a naked singularity, which could provide an observational method for
testing the existence of such objects. We apply our formalism to the Galactic
black hole and predict that the corrections to the image positions are at the
level of 10 micro-arcseconds, while the correction to the time delay is a few
hundredths of a second. These corrections would be measurable today if a pulsar
were found to be lensed by the Galactic black hole; and they should be readily
detectable with planned missions like MAXIM.

brought into accord with the WMAP measured value when bino-wino co-annihilation

m_{\tilde Z_2}-m_{\tilde Z_1} ~ 20-80 GeV, so that tree level two body decays

Yang-Mills theory on the sphere and its role in connecting topological strings
to black hole entropy. We study in detail the chiral theory defined in terms of
uncoupled single U(N) representations at large N and write down the resulting
partition function by means of the topological vertex. The emergent toric
geometry has three Kaehler parameters, one of which corresponds to the expected
fibration over the sphere. By taking a suitable double-scaling limit we recover
the chiral Gross-Taylor string expansion. To analyse the phase transition we
construct a matrix model which describes the chiral gauge theory. It has three
distinct phases, one of which should be described by the closed topological
string expansion. We verify this expectation by explicit comparison between the
matrix model and the chiral topological string free energies. We also show that
the critical point in the pertinent phase of the matrix model corresponds to a
divergence of the topological string perturbation series.

of generalized $Spin(7)$ structures, defined in terms of certain spinors of

constrained to satisfy a pair of differential equations. The formalism based on
the group $Spin(7)$ is the most suitable language in which to describe
supersymmetric compactifications on eight-manifolds of $Spin(7)$ structure,

Z_2-symmetric scalar thick brane in both a 5-dimensional Riemannian space time
and a pure geometric Weyl integrable manifold. This work was mainly motivated
by the hypothesis which claims that Weyl geometries mimic quantum behaviour
classically. We start by obtaining a classical 4-dimensional Poincare invariant
thick brane solution which does not respect Z_2-symmetry along the
(non-)compact extra dimension. The scalar energy density of our field
configuration represents several series of thick branes with positive and
negative energy densities centered at y_0. The only qualitative difference we
have encountered when comparing both frames is that the scalar curvature of the
Riemannian manifold turns out to be singular for the found solution, whereas
its Weylian counterpart presents a regular behaviour. By studying the
transverse traceless modes of the fluctuations of the classical backgrounds, we
recast their equations into a Schroedinger's equation form with a volcano
potential of finite bottom (in both frames). By solving the Schroedinger
equation for the massless zero mode m^2=0 we obtain a single bound state which
represents a stable 4-dimensional graviton in both frames. We also get a
continuum gapless spectrum of KK states with positive m^2>0 that are suppressed
at y_0, turning into continuum plane wave modes as ""y"" approaches spatial
infinity. We show that for the considered solution to our setup, the potential
is always bounded and cannot adopt the form of a well with infinite walls;
thus, we do not get a discrete spectrum of KK states, and we conclude that the
claim that Weylian structures mimic, classically, quantum behaviour does not
constitute a generic feature of these geometric manifolds.

alpha_1,..., alpha_n in C, tr(log|alpha_1 T_1+ ... + alpha_n T_n - 1|) is the
integral of log|alpha_1 z_1 + ... + alpha_n z_n-1| w.r.t mu_{T_1,...,T_n}.
Moreover, for every polynomial q in n commuting variables, mu_{q(T_1,..., T_n)}
is the push-forward measure of mu_{T_1,...,T_n} via the map q. In addition it
is shown that, as in [HS], for every Borelset B in C^n there is a maximal
closed T_1-,..., T_n-invariant subspace K affiliated with M, such that
mu_{T_1|_K,..., T_n|_K} is concentrated on B. Moreover,
tr(P_K)=mu_{T_1,...,T_n}(B). This generalizes the main result from [HS] to
n-tuples of commuting operators in M.

optimal exercise regions for multi-dimensional Bermudan options can be
established by reference to Neveu's theory of Snell envelopes -- and also, as
will be shown, more directly from standard martingale arguments combined with
the strong Markov property. Based on this, in the framework of a log-L\'evy
martingale market, explicit formulae and asymptotic results on the perpetual
American-Bermudan (barrier-like) put option price difference (``continuity
correction'') near the exercise boundary will be proven, under the -- of
course, fairly restrictive -- assumption that the logarithmic optimal exercise
region, subject to the barrier, does not depend on the time mesh size and is,
up to translation, a half-space.
  For this sake, Wiener-Hopf type results by Feller will be generalized to
higher dimensions. It will be shown that an extrapolation from the exact
Bermudan prices to the American price cannot be polynomial in the exercise mesh
size in the setting of many common market models, and more specific bounds on
the natural scaling exponent of the non-polynomial extrapolation for a number
of (both one- and multi-dimensional) market models will be deduced.

fields D on 6-manifolds M that satisfy the nondegeneracy condition that
D+[D,D]=TM I give a solution of the equivalence problem for such D (as Tanaka
has previously), showing that it defines a so(4,3)-valued Cartan connection on
a principal right H-bundle over M where H is the subgroup of SO(4,3) that
stabilizes a null 3-plane in R^{4,3}. Along the way, I observe that there is
associated to each such D a canonical conformal structure of split type on M,
one that depends on two derivatives of the plane field D.
  I show how the primary curvature tensor of the Cartan connection associated
to the equivalence problem for D can be interpreted as the Weyl curvature of
the associated conformal structure and, moreover, show that the split conformal
structures in dimension~6 that arise in this fashion are exactly the ones whose
so(4,4)-valued Cartan connection admits a reduction to a spin(4,3)-connection.

particular, our study determines the ratio of the surface-to-volume
contributions to the nuclear symmetry energy to be ~1.6 and reveals that
contributions due to mean-level spacing and effective strength of the isovector
mean-potential are almost equal after removing momentum-dependent effects by
rescaling them with isoscalar and isovector effective masses, respectively.

consisting of three and six amino acids. For these molecules we have calculated
potential energy surfaces as a function of the Ramachandran angles phi and psi,
which are widely used for the characterization of the polypeptide chains. These
particular degrees of freedom are essential for the characterization of
proteins folding process. Calculations have been carried out within ab initio
theoretical framework based on the density functional theory and accounting for
all the electrons in the system. We have determined stable conformations and
calculated the energy barriers for transitions between them. Using a
thermodynamic approach, we have estimated the times of the characteristic
transitions between these conformations. The results of our calculations have
been compared with those obtained by other theoretical methods and with the
available experimental data extracted from the Protein Data Base. This
comparison demonstrates a reasonable correspondence of the most prominent
minima on the calculated potential energy surfaces to the experimentally
measured angles phi and psi for the glycine chains appearing in native
proteins. We have also investigated the influence of the secondary structure of
polypeptide chains on the formation of the potential energy landscape. This
analysis has been performed for the sheet and the helix conformations of chains
of six amino acids.

presented. That is, the dimer's lowest energy configuration is not necessarily
a stack, as it might had been expected a priori. This is a surprising result
for dimer of such a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) as coronene.
The energy of the T-shaped configuration at all considered levels of density
functional theory (B3LYP,PBE/6-31+G(d),D95,cc-pVDZ,cc-pVTZ) was systematically
lower than the energies of three plausible stack configurations. In order to
get a better description of the van der Waals interaction,the density
functional theory (DFT) results were adjusted by adding a phenomenological
Lennard-Jones-type term into the total energy of the system. However, the van
der Waals correction is somewhat arbitrary and its magnitude can not be
rigorously justified. Depending on the choice of the parameters in the
phenomenological term both the T-shaped and the parallel-displaced (PD) stack
configurations can be the global energy minimum of the system. A simple model
is proposed which is useful for qualitative understanding of possible
geometries of the coronene dimer and larger coronene clusters. The model
represents coronene dimer as two sets of charged rings interacting via Coulomb
and Lennard-Jones potentials. The model provides an intuitively clear
explanation why the T-shaped dimers can be of importance even for some of
moderately large PAHs such as coronene and, may be, for circumcoronene.

involved in the regulation of biochemical pathways. Following the work of
Newsholme and Crabtree, we develop a quantitative theory for this idea based on
open-system thermodynamics and metabolic control analysis. It is shown that the
{\it stoichiometric sensitivity} of an intermediary metabolite concentration
with respect to changes in steady-state flux is governed by the effective
equilibrium constant of the intermediate formation, and the equilibrium can be
regulated by a futile cycle. The direction of the shift in the effective
equilibrium constant depends on the direction of operation of the futile cycle.
High stoichiometric sensitivity corresponds to ultrasensitivity of an
intermediate concentration to net flow through a pathway; low stoichiometric
sensitivity corresponds to super-robustness of concentration with respect to
changes in flux. Both cases potentially play important roles in metabolic
regulation. Futile cycles actively shift the effective equilibrium by expending
energy; the magnitude of changes in effective equilibria and sensitivities is a
function of the amount of energy used by a futile cycle. This proposed
mechanism for control by futile cycles works remarkably similarly to kinetic
proofreading in biosynthesis. The sensitivity of the system is also intimately
related to the rate of concentration fluctuations of intermediate metabolites.
The possibly different roles of the two major mechanisms for cellular
biochemical regulation, namely reversible chemical modifications via futile
cycles and shifting equilibrium by macromolecular binding, are discussed.

for performing accurate theoretical calculations. Using accurate experimental
data for the permittivities we present, via the Lifshitz formula applied to the
standard Casimir setup with two parallel plates, accurate theoretical results
in case of the metals Au, Cu and Al. Both similar and dissimilar cases are
considered. Concentrating in particular on the finite temperature effect, we
show how the Casimir pressure varies with separation for three different
temperatures, T={1, 300, 350}K. The metal surfaces are taken to be perfectly
plane. The experimental data for the permittivities are generally yielding
results that are in good agreement with those calculated from the Drude
relation with finite relaxation frequency. We give the results in tabular form,
in order to facilitate the assessment of the temperature correction which is on
the 1% level. We emphasize two points: (i) The most promising route for a
definite experimental verification of the finite temperature correction appears
to be to concentrate on the case of large separations (optimum around 2
micrometres); and (ii) there is no conflict between the present kind of theory
and the Nernst theorem in thermodynamics.

variable regime is introduced. It consists of an Optical Parametric Oscillator
with two type-II phase-matched non-linear crystals orthogonally oriented,
associated with birefringent elements for adjustable linear coupling. We give
in this paper a theoretical study of its classical and quantum properties. It
is shown that two optical beams with adjustable frequencies and well-defined
polarization can be emitted. The Stokes parameters of the two beams are
entangled. The principal advantage of this setup is the possibility to directly
generate polarization entangled light without the need of mixing four modes on
beam splitters as required in current experimental setups. This device opens
new directions for the study of light-matter interfaces and generation of
multimode non-classical light and higher dimensional phase space.

to that for the brachistochrone in classical mechanics. We reduce the problem
to a formal equation for the Hamiltonian which depends on certain constraint
functions specifying the range of available Hamiltonians. For some simple
examples of the constraints, we explicitly find the optimal solutions.

possible with certainty, by using the existence of incomparable states which
are not interconvertible deterministically by local operations and classical

flipper, the incomparability of a pair of bipartite pure entangled states can
be established.
