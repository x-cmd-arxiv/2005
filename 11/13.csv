origin of the solar abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru. This process also offers
a natural explanation for the large abundance of Sr seen in an hyper-metal-poor

types. We are motivated to identify Type Ia SNe based only on broadband
photometric information, since spectroscopic determination of the SN type, the
traditional method, requires significant amounts of time on large telescopes.
We consider the possible observables provided by a large synoptic photometry
survey. We examine the optical colors and magnitudes of many SN types from
z=0.1 to z=1.0, using space-based ultraviolet spectra and ground-based optical
spectra to simulate the photometry. We also discuss the evolution of colors
over the SN outburst and the use of host galaxy characteristics to aid in the
identification of Type Ia SNe. We consider magnitudes in both the SDSS
photometric system and in a proposed filter system with logarithmically spaced
bandpasses. We find that photometric information in four bands covering the
entire optical spectrum appears capable of providing identification of Type Ia
SNe based on their colors at a single observed epoch soon after maximum light,
even without independent estimates of the SN redshift. Very blue filters are
extremely helpful, as at moderate redshift they sample the restframe
ultraviolet spectrum where the SN types are very different. We emphasize the
need for further observations of SNe in the restframe ultraviolet to fully
characterize, refine, and improve this method of SN type identification.

corresponding to a range of conditions relevant to interstellar atomic and
molecular cooling processes. Boundary conditions corresponding to a return to
the upstream temperature ($R$ = 1) and to a cold wall ($R$ = 0) are
investigated. We find that for Mach number $M > 5$, the strong shock
overstability limits are not significantly modified. For $M < 3$, however,
shocks are considerably more stable for most cases. In general, as the shock
weakens, the critical values of the temperature power-law index (below which
shocks are overstable) are reduced for the overtones more than for the
fundamental, which signifies a change in basic behaviour. In the $R$ = 0
scenario, however, we find that the overstability regime and growth rate of the
fundamental mode are increased when cooling is under local thermodynamic
equilibrium. We provide a possible explanation for the results in terms of a
stabilising influence provided downstream but a destabilising effect associated
with the shock front. We conclude that the regime of overstability for
interstellar atomic shocks is well represented by the strong shock limit unless
the upstream gas is hot. Although molecular shocks can be overstable to
overtones, the magnetic field provides a significant stabilising influence.

spacetime is devised as a four-dimensional hypersurface {\it orthogonal} to the
extra dimension in a five-dimensional bulk. We show that the FRW line element
can be ""reinvented"" on a dynamical four-dimensional hypersurface, which is {\it
not} orthogonal to the extra dimension, without any internal contradiction.
This hypersurface is selected by the requirement of continuity of the metric
and depends explicitly on the evolution of the extra dimension. The main
difference between the ""conventional"" FRW, on an orthogonal hypersurface, and
the new one is that the later contains higher-dimensional modifications to the
regular matter density and pressure in 4D. We compare the evolution of the
spacetime in these two interpretations. We find that a wealth of ""new"" physics
can be derived from a five-dimensional metric if it is interpreted on a
dynamical (non-orthogonal) 4D hypersurface. In particular, in the context of a
well-known cosmological metric in $5D$, we construct a FRW model which is
consistent with the late accelerated expansion of the universe, while fitting
simultaneously the observational data for the deceleration parameter. The model
predicts an effective equation of state for the universe, which is consistent
with observations.

between the first generation and the other two generations of heavy Majorana
neutrinos is responsible for the deviation of the solar neutrino mixing angle
$\theta^{}_{12}$ from its initial value $35.3^\circ$ given by $V^{}_0$, and the
slight breaking of the mass degeneracy between the second and third generations
of heavy Majorana neutrinos results in a small mixing angle $\theta^{}_{13}$
