microns in the Orion Molecular Cloud, OMC1, using the GriF instrument on the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. GriF is a combination of adaptive optics and
Fabry-Perot interferometry, yielding a spatial resolution of 0.15"" to 0.18"" and
a velocity discrimination as high as 1 km/s. Thanks to the high spatial and
velocity resolution of the GriF data, 193 bright H2 emission regions can be
identified in OMC1. The general characteristics of these features are described
in terms of radial velocities, brightness and spatial displacement of maxima of
velocity and brightness, the latter to yield the orientation of flows in the
plane of the sky. Strong spatial correlation between velocity and bright H2
emission is found and serves to identify many features as shocks. Important
results are: (i) velocities of the excited gas illustrate the presence of a
zone to the south of BN-IRc2 and Peak 1, and the west of Peak 2, where there is
a powerful blue-shifted outflow with an average velocity of -18 km/s. This is
shown to be the NIR counterpart of an outflow identified in the radio from
source I, a very young O-star. (ii) There is a band of weak velocity features
(<5 km/s) in Peak 1 which may share a common origin through an explosive event,
in the BN-IRc2 region, with the fast-moving fingers (or bullets) to the NW of
OMC1. (iii) A proportion of the flows are likely to represent sites of low mass
star formation and several regions show multiple outflows, probably indicative
of multiple star formation within OMC1. The high spatial and velocity
resolution of the GriF data show these and other features in more detail than
has previously been possible.

intensities, 1/4 keV soft X-ray surface brightness, area coverage, and volume
occupation of the population of isolated SNRs above the Galaxy's HI layer.
Irrespective of assumed supernova explosion energy, ambient nonthermal
pressure, or frictional drag coefficient, the predicted O VI column density
matches the observed distribution between 130 pc and 2000 pc. The SNRs' O VI
intensity is a significant fraction of the average observed intensity. Within
the range of uncertainty in the SN rate, such SNRs can explain all of the
observed 1/4 keV surface brightness attributed to the extraplanar gas beyond
the H I layer in the southern hemisphere (~400 x 10^-6 counts/s/arcmin^2).
Thus, extraplanar SNRs could be the most important source of hot gas between
the Local Bubble and z ~ 2000 pc in the relatively quiescent southern
hemisphere. These results stand whether the remnants are assumed to be buoyant
or not. The population of old extraplanar SNRs should cover most of the high
latitude sky, but bright young extraplanar SNRs should cover less than 1% of
the sky. Perhaps the l=247, b=-64 crescent in the 1/4 keV X-ray maps could be a

study the temperature and ionization structure of Keplerian disks around
Classical Be stars. The method we employ is largely similiar to the Monte Carlo
transition probability method developed by Lucy. Here we present a
simplification of his method that avoids the use of the macro atom concept. Our
investigations of the temperature structure of Be star disks show that the disk
temperature behavior is a hybrid between the behavior of Young Stellar Object
(YSO) disks and Hot Star winds. The optically thick inner parts of Be star
disks have temperatures that are similar to YSO disks, while the optically thin
outer parts are like stellar winds. Thus, the temperature at the disk midplane
initially drops, reaching a minimum at 3--5 stellar radii, after which it rises
back to the optically thin radiative equilibrium temperature at large
distances. On the other hand, the optically thin upper layers of the disk are
approximately isothermal -- a behavior that is analogous to the hot upper
layers of YSO disks. We also find that the disks are fully ionized, as
expected, but there is an ionization minimum in the vicinity of the temperature
minimum. Finally, we find that, despite the complex temperature structure, the
infrared excess is well-approximated by an equivalent isothermal disk model
whose temperature is about 60% of the stellar temperature. This is largely
because, at long wavelengths, the effective photosphere of the disk is located
in its isothermal regions.

low relative velocity between the quasar and the merger-remnant galaxy. The gas

studies of the physics of atomic line formation in NS atmospheres. Chang,
Bildsten and Wasserman showed that the hydrogenic Fe H$\alpha$ line formed
above the photosphere of a bursting NS is intrinsically broad. We now include
rotational broadening within general relativity and compare the resulting
profile to that observed during Type I bursts from EXO 0748-676. We show that
the fine structure splitting of the line precludes a meaningful constraint on
the radius. Our fitting of the data show that the line forming Fe column is
${\rm log}_{10} (N_{\rm Fe, n=2}/{\rm cm^{-2}})=17.9_{-0.42}^{+0.27}$ and
gravitational redshift $1+z =1.345_{-0.008}^{+0.005}$ with 95% confidence. We
calculate the detectability of this spectral feature for a large range of spins
and inclinations assuming that the emission comes from the entire surface. We
find that at 300 (600) Hz only 10-20% (5-10%) of NSs would have spectral

utilizes the statistics of Doppler-broadened spectral lines. The technique
relates the power Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS), i.e. the spectrum of
fluctuations measured along the velocity axis in Position-Position-Velocity
(PPV) data cubes available from observations, to the underlying power spectra
of the velocity/density fluctuations. Unlike the standard spatial spectra, that
are function of angular wavenumber, the VCS is a function of the velocity wave
number k_v ~ 1/v. We show that absorption affects the VCS to a higher degree
for small k_v and obtain the criteria for disregarding the absorption effects
for turbulence studies at large k_v. We consider the retrieval of turbulence
spectra from observations for high and low spatial resolution observations and
find that the VCS allows one to study turbulence even when the emitting
turbulent volume is not spatially resolved. This opens interesting prospects
for using the technique for extragalactic research. We show that, while thermal
broadening interferes with the turbulence studies using the VCS, it is possible
to separate thermal and non-thermal contributions. This allows a new way of
determining the temperature of the interstellar gas using emission and
absorption spectral lines.

Survey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (DSCs). Compared to
globular clusters (GCs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities
(M_V > -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 < r_h < 30 pc), but they are
principally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can be
more than three magnitudes fainter than a typical GC (mu_g > 20 mag arcsec^-2).
The median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 < g-z < 1.6,
which is redder than metal-rich GCs and often as red as the galaxy itself. Most
DSC systems thus have mean ages older than 5 Gyr or else have super-solar
metallicities. We find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significant
excess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (S0s), and
five visibly contain dust. We also find a substantial population of DSCs in the
halo of the giant elliptical M49, associated with the companion galaxy VCC
1199. Most DSC systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light and
associated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do not
host substantial DSC populations. Diffuse star clusters in our sample share
similar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,
and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that DSCs preferentially form, survive, and
coevolve with galactic disks. Their properties are broadly consistent with
those of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5
magnitudes brighter than DSCs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surface
brightnesses. The closest Galactic analogs to the DSCs are the old open
clusters. We suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in the
disk of the Milky Way, it would be very difficult to find. (Abridged)

follow a power law in radius outside of the cluster core. Here we present a
simple formula giving both the normalization and slope for the power-law
entropy profiles of clusters that form in the absence of non-gravitational
processes such as radiative cooling and subsequent feedback. It is based on
seventy-one clusters drawn from four separate cosmological simulations, two
using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and two using adaptive-mesh
refinement (AMR), and can be used as a baseline for assessing the impact of
non-gravitational processes on the intracluster medium outside of cluster

which the normalization of the entropy profile scales linearly with cluster
temperature, and these profiles are in excellent agreement outside of 0.2
r_200. Because the observed entropy profiles of clusters do not scale linearly
with temperature, our models confirm that non-gravitational processes are
necessary to break the self-similarity seen in the simulations. However, the
core entropy levels found by the two codes used here significantly differ, with
the AMR code producing nearly twice as much entropy at the centre of a cluster.

our galaxies we construct maps of the HI column density at a constant linear
resolution of ~300 pc; this forms an excellent data set to check for the
presence of a threshold column density for star formation. We find that while
current star formation (as traced by Halpha emission) is confined to regions
with relatively large (N_HI > (0.4 -1.7) X 10^{21} atoms cm^{-2}) HI column
density, the morphology of the Halpha emission is in general not correlated
with that of the high HI column density gas. Thus, while high column density
gas may be necessary for star formation, in this sample at least, it is not
sufficient to ensure that star formation does in fact occur. We examine the
line profiles of the HI emission, but do not find a simple relation between
regions with complex line profiles and those with on-going star formation.
Finally, we examine the very fine scale (~20-100 pc) distribution of the HI
gas, and find that at these scales the emission exhibits a variety of shell
like, clumpy and filamentary features. The Halpha emission is sometimes
associated with high density HI clumps, sometimes the Halpha emission lies
inside a high density shell, and sometimes there is no correspondence between
the Halpha emission and the HI clumps. In summary, the interplay between star
formation and gas density in these galaxy does not seem to show the simple
large scale patterns observed in brighter galaxies (abridged).

measured Hbeta and [OIII]5007 emission line fluxes from J-band spectra, and
Halpha line fluxes plus upper limits for [NII]6584 fluxes from H-band spectra.
The z~1.4 galaxies are characterized by the high [OIII]/[OII] line ratios, low
extinction and low metallicity that are typical of lower luminosity CADIS
galaxies at 0.4<z<0.7, and of more luminous Lyman Break Galaxies at z~3, but
not seen in CFRS galaxies at 0.4<z<0.9. This type of spectrum (e.g., high
[OIII]/[OII]) is seen in progressively more luminous galaxies as the redshift
increases. These spectra are caused by a combination of high ionisation
parameter q and lower [O/H]. Pegase2 chemical evolution models are used to
relate the observed metallicities and luminosities of z~1.4 galaxies to galaxy
samples at lower and higher redshift. Not surpringsingly, we see a relationship
between redshift and inferred chemical age. We suppose that the metal-enriched
reservoirs of star forming gas that we are probing at intermediate redshifts
are being mostly consumed to build up both the disk and the bulge components of
spiral galaxies. Finally, our analysis of the metallicity-luminosity relation
at 0<z<1.5 suggests that the period of rapid chemical evolution may take place
progressively in lower mass systems as the universe ages. These results are
consistent with a ``downsizing'' type picture in the sense that particular

different proposals for the explanation of this acceleration, such as the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, decaying vacuum energy, an evolving scalar
field (quintessence), phantom energy, etc. Most of these proposals require the
existence of exotic matter with negative pressure violating the strong energy
condition. On the other hand, there have appeared many models which offer
dramatically different mechanisms for the current acceleration, in which dark
energy emerges from the gravity sector rather than from the matter sector. In
this paper, we compare the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model with the
Sahni-Shtanov brane-world models of dark energy by using the Akaike and
Bayesian information criteria. We show that new parameters in the brane model
are not statistically significant in terms of the information criteria,
although the best fit method gives an improved fit to the SNIa data, because of
the additional parameters. This is because the information criteria of model
selection compensate for this advantage by penalizing models having more free
parameters. We conclude that only new future observational data are accurate
enough to give an advantage to dark-energy models of the brane origin, i.e., a
very high-significance detection is required to justify the presence of new
parameters. In our statistical analysis both Riess et al.'s and Astier et al.'s
SNIa samples are used. For stringent constraining parameters of the models the

unresolved (~1"") 7 mm continuum emission, being one of the brightest isolated
Herbig AeBe stars ever detected with the VLA at this wavelength. No emission is
detected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a 3 sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From
these values, we obtain a spectral index of ~2.5 in the 3.5 cm to 7 mm
wavelength range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most
likely dominated by thermal dust emission coming from a circumstellar disc. We
use available photometric data from the literature to model the spectral energy
distribution (SED) of this object from radio to near-ultraviolet frequencies.
The observed SED can be understood in terms of an irradiated accretion disc
with low mass accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar masses per year, surrounding a star
with an age of ~10 Myr. We infer that the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar
masses, and is populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1
mm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at 10 microns.
These features, as well as indications of settling in the wall at the dust

stage of dust evolution, particularly in its inner regions.

improvements on imaging capabilities require a detailed review of the
assumptions of classical astrometric modeling.
  Aims:We show that Light-Travel Time must be taken into account to model the
kinematics of astronomical objects in nonlinear motion, even at stellar
distances.
  Methods:A closed expression to include Light-Travel Time in the actual
astrometric models with nonlinear motion is provided. Using a perturbative
approach the expression of the Light-Travel Time signature is derived. We
propose a practical form of the astrometric modelling to be applied in
astrometric data reduction of sources at stellar distances($d>1 pc$).
  Results :We show that the Light-Travel Time signature is relevant at $\muas$
accuracy (or even at $mas$) depending on the time span of the astrometric
measurements. We explain how information about the radial motion of a source
can be obtained. Some estimative numbers are provided for known nearby binary

  Conclusions :In the light of the obtained results, it is clear that this
effect must be taken into account to interpret any kind of precise astrometric
measurements. The effect is particularly interesting in measurements performed
by the planned astrometric space missions (GAIA, SIM, JASMINE, TPF/DARWIN).

to establish their properties in the optical range. Both pulsars are detected
at >10 sigma level. Geminga is for the first time reliably detected in the I
band with a magnitude of 25.10+/-0.14. We also reanalyze archival ESO/NTT and
HST broadband data and find that some published fluxes for Geminga were
estimated inaccurately. The resulting dereddened broadband spectra of both
pulsars are remarkably similar to each other and show significant flux
increases towards the far-UV and near-IR, and a wide flux excess in V-I bands.
This suggests a multicomponent structure of the optical emission. The
nonthermal power law component of the pulsar magnetospheric origin dominates in
the most part of the optical range. For PSR B0656+14 it is compatible with a
low energy extension of the power law tail seen in hard X-rays. For Geminga the
respective extension overshoots by a factor of 100 the nonthermal optical flux,
which has a less steep spectral slope than in X-rays. This implies a spectral
break at a photon energy of about 1 keV. The flux increases towards the far-UV
are compatible with contributions of the Rayleigh-Jeans parts of the blackbody
components from whole surfaces of the neutron stars dominating in soft X-rays.
The V-I excess, which is most significant for PSR B0656+14, suggests a third
spectral component of still unidentified origin. Faint, a few arcseconds in
size nebulae extended perpendicular to the proper motion directions of the
pulsars, are seen around both objects in our deepest I band images. They can be
optical counterparts of the bow-shock head of Geminga and of the tentative
pulsar wind nebula of PSR B0656+14 observed in X-rays.

buckling of a thin elastic rod under axial compression. The analysis of a

contact is considered. The contact resistance is calculated as a function of
temperature and film geometry, and is found to vanish rapidly with temperature,
according to a universal, nearly activated form, becoming strictly zero only at
zero temperature. At the lowest temperatures, the activation barrier is set
primarily by the superfluid stiffness in the films, and displays only a weak
(i.e., logarithmic) temperature dependence. The Josephson effect is thus
destroyed, albeit only weakly, as a consequence of the power-law-correlated
superconducting fluctuations present in the films below the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature. The behavior of the
resistance is discussed, both in various limiting regimes and as it crosses
over between these regimes. Details are presented of a minimal model of the
films and the contact, and of the calculation of the resistance. A formulation
in terms of quantum phase-slip events is employed, which is natural and
effective in the limit of a good contact. However, it is also shown to be
effective even when the contact is poor and is, indeed, indispensable, as the
system always behaves as if it were in the good-contact limit at low enough
temperature. A simple mechanical analogy is introduced to provide some
heuristic understanding of the nearly-activated temperature dependence of the
resistance. Prospects for experimental tests of the predicted behavior are
discussed, and numerical estimates relevant to anticipated experimental

an important role. At zero temperature, two superconducting phases can exist,
depending primarily on the strength of the dissipation. In the fully
superconducting phase (FSC), each grain acts superconducting, and the coupling
to the dissipative conduction is important. In the SC* phase, the dissipation
is irrelevant at long wavelengths. The phase transitions between these two
superconducting phases and the normal metallic phase may be either local or
global, and possess rich and complex critical properties. These are inferred
from both weak and strong coupling renormalization group analyses. At
intermediate temperatures, near either superconductor-to-normal phase
transition, there are regimes of super-metallic behavior, in which the
resistivity first decreases gradually with decreasing temperature before
eventually increasing as temperature is lowered further. The results on chains
of Josephson junctions are extended to continuous superconducting nanowires and

have been analyzed by several groups resulting in a general picture of the WWW
that encompasses many of the complex properties typical of rapidly evolving

and structural differences of Web crawls that might induce properties not
representative of the actual global underlying graph. In order to provide a
more accurate characterization of the Web graph and identify observables which
are clearly discriminating with respect to the sampling process, we study the
behavior of degree-degree correlation functions and the statistics of
reciprocal connections. The latter appears to enclose the relevant correlations

is introduced and some of its many consequences are discussed. We show that
this area theorem gives rise to an upper-bound on the maximum a posteriori

extrinsic soft bit estimates delivered by the belief propagation decoder
coincide with the correct a posteriori probabilities above the maximum a

the symmetry axis. We consider the situation in which null dust is emitted
again from the naked singularity formed by the collapsed null dust and
investigate the back-reaction by this emission for the naked singularity. We
show a very peculiar but physically important case in which the same amount of
null dust as that of the collapsed one is emitted from the naked singularity as
soon as the ingoing null dust hits the symmetry axis and forms the naked
singularity. In this case, although this naked singularity satisfies the strong
curvature condition by Kr\'{o}lak (limiting focusing condition), geodesics
which hit the singularity can be extended uniquely across the singularity.
Therefore we may say that the collapsing null dust passes through the
singularity formed by itself and then leaves for infinity. Finally the
singularity completely disappears and the flat spacetime remains.

forms of quarks and leptons. In this paper we investigate the S3 permutation
symmetry and derive the general forms of mass matrices in various types of S3
theories. We also exhibit particular realizations of previous ansatze of mass
matrices, which have often been applied in the literature to the standard model
Yukawa sector. Discrete flavor symmetry is also advantageous for vanishing
matrix elements being dynamically generated in the vacuum of scalar potential.
This is due to the fact that group operations are discrete. While zero elements
themselves do not explain mass hierarchies, we introduce an abelian flavor
symmetry. A non-trivial issue is whether successful quantum numbers can be
assigned so that they are compatible with other (non-abelian) flavor
symmetries. We show typical examples of charge assignments which not only
produce hierarchical orders of mass eigenvalues but also prohibit
non-renormalizable operators which disturb the hierarchies in first-order

mesons with masses $M\le 3$ GeV. The calculations have been performed for the
mesons lying on linear trajectories in the $(n,M^2)$-planes, where $n$ is the
radial quantum number. Our consideration relates to the $q\bar q$ states with
one component in the flavor space, with the quark and antiquark masses equal to
each other, such as $\pi(0^{-+})$, $\rho(1^{--})$, $\omega(1^{--})$,
$\phi(1^{--})$, $a_0(0^{++})$, $a_1(1^{++})$, $a_2(2^{++})$, $b_1(1^{+-})$,
$f_2(2^{++})$, $\pi_2(2^{-+})$, $\rho_3(3^{--})$, $\omega_3(3^{--})$,
$\phi_3(3^{--})$, $\pi_4(4^{-+})$ at $n\le 6$. We obtained the wave functions
and mass values of mesons lying on these trajectories. The corresponding
trajectories are linear, in agreement with data. We have calculated the
two-photon decays $\pi\to \gamma\gamma$, $a_0(980)\to \gamma\gamma$,
$a_2(1320)\to \gamma\gamma$, $f_2(1285)\to \gamma\gamma$, $f_2(1525)\to

$\omega\to\gamma\pi$, that agree qualitatively with the experiment. On this

principle for asymptotically flat spacetimes in any spacetime dimension $ d \ge
4$. The new counter-term makes direct contact with more familiar background
subtraction procedures, but is a local algebraic function of the boundary
metric and Ricci curvature. The corresponding action satisfies two important
properties required for a proper treatment of semi-classical issues and, in
particular, to connect with any dual non-gravitational description of
asymptotically flat space. These properties are that 1) the action is finite
on-shell and 2) asymptotically flat solutions are stationary points under {\it
all} variations preserving asymptotic flatness; i.e., not just under variations
of compact support. Our definition of asymptotic flatness is sufficiently
general to allow the magentic part of the Weyl tensor to be of the same order
as the electric part and thus, for d=4, to have non-vanishing NUT charge.
Definitive results are demonstrated when the boundary is either a cylindrical
or a hyperbolic (i.e., de Sitter space) representation of spacelike infinity
($i^0$), and partial results are provided for more general representations of
$i^0$. For the cylindrical or hyperbolic representations of $i^0$, similar
results are also shown to hold for both a counter-term proportional to the
square-root of the boundary Ricci scalar and for a more complicated
counter-term suggested previously by Kraus, Larsen, and Siebelink. Finally, we
show that such actions lead, via a straightforward computation, to conserved
quantities at spacelike infinity which agree with, but are more general than,
the usual (e.g., ADM) results.

black hole background at finite temperature, and compare with known 0A matrix
model results. It has been claimed that there is a disagreement for the free
energy between the spacetime and the dual matrix model. Here we find that this
discrepancy is sensitive to how the cutoff is implemented on the spacetime
side. In particular, the disagreement is resolved once we put the cutoff at a
fixed distance away from the horizon, as opposed to a fixed position in space.
Furthermore, the mass and the entropy of the black hole itself add up to an
analytic contribution to the free energy, which is precisely reproduced by the
0A matrix model. We also use results from the 0A matrix model to predict the
next to leading order contribution to the entropy of the black hole. Finally,
we note that the black hole is characterized by a Hagedorn growth in its
density of states below the Hagedorn temperature. This, together with other
results, suggests there is a phase transition at this temperature.

with rational parameters into a finite number of weighted convolutions, which
can be interpreted as another twisted convolution on a finite cyclic group. In
analogy with the twisted convolution of finite discrete signals, we derive an
anti-homomorphism between the sequence space and a suitable matrix algebra
which preserves the algebraic structure. In this way, the problem reduces to
the analysis of finite matrices whose entries are sequences supported on
corresponding cosets. The invertibility condition then follows from Cramer's
rule and Wiener's lemma for this special class of matrices. The problem results
from a well known approach of studying the invertibility properties of the
Gabor frame operator in the rational case. The presented approach gives further
insights into Gabor frames. In particular, it can be applied for both the
continuous (on $\Rd$) and the finite discrete setting. In the latter case, we
obtain algorithmic schemes for directly computing the inverse of Gabor
frame-type matrices equivalent to those known in the literature.

Bayesian statistics, where they are used to compare models, and in statistical
physics, where they correspond to differences in free energy. Two approaches
have long been used to estimate ratios of normalizing constants. The `simple
importance sampling' (SIS) or `free energy perturbation' method uses a sample
drawn from just one of the two distributions. The `bridge sampling' or
`acceptance ratio' estimate can be viewed as the ratio of two SIS estimates
involving a bridge distribution. For both methods, difficult problems must be
handled by introducing a sequence of intermediate distributions linking the two
distributions of interest, with the final ratio of normalizing constants being
estimated by the product of estimates of ratios for adjacent distributions in
this sequence. Recently, work by Jarzynski, and independently by Neal, has
shown how one can view such a product of estimates, each based on simple
importance sampling using a single point, as an SIS estimate on an extended
state space. This `Annealed Importance Sampling' (AIS) method produces an
exactly unbiased estimate for the ratio of normalizing constants even when the
Markov transitions used do not reach equilibrium. In this paper, I show how a
corresponding `Linked Importance Sampling' (LIS) method can be constructed in
which the estimates for individual ratios are similar to bridge sampling
estimates. I show empirically that for some problems, LIS estimates are much
more accurate than AIS estimates found using the same computation time,
although for other problems the two methods have similar performance. Linked
sampling methods similar to LIS are useful for other purposes as well.

that if a node has a single parent and single grandparent, then there is a
unique walk from the highest weight node to it. In other classical types, there
is a similar (but necessarily more technical) statement. This walk is obtained
from the associated level 1 perfect crystal, $B^{1,1}$. (It is unique unless
the Dynkin diagram contains that of $D_4$ as a subdiagram.)
  This crystal observation was motivated by representation-theoretic behavior
of the affine Hecke algebra of type $A$, which is known to be captured by
highest weight crystals of type $A^{(1)}$ by results of Grojnowski. As
discussed below, the proofs in either setting are straightforward, and so the
theorem linking the two phenomena is not needed. However, the result is
presented here for crystals as one can say something in all types (Grojnowski's
theorem is only in type $A$), and because the statement seems more surprising

characterizing quantitatively spiral-like elements in complex stripe-like
patterns. The approach provides the location of the spiral tip and the size of
the spiral arms in terms of their arclength and their winding number. In
addition, it yields the number of pattern components (Betti number), as well as
their size and certain aspects of their shape. We apply the method to spiral
defect chaos in thermally driven Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and find that the
arclength of spirals decreases monotonically with decreasing Prandtl number of
the fluid and increasing heating. By contrast, the winding number of the
spirals is non-monotonic in the heating. The distribution function for the
number of spirals is significantly narrower than a Poisson distribution. The
distribution function for the winding number shows approximately an exponential
decay. It depends only weakly on the heating, but strongly on the Prandtl
number. Large spirals arise only for larger Prandtl numbers ($Pr \gtrsim 1$).
In this regime the joint distribution for the spiral length and the winding
number exhibits a three-peak structure indicating the dominance of Archimedean
spirals of opposite sign and relatively straight sections. For small Prandtl
numbers the distribution function reveals a large number of small compact
pattern components.

Long-living quadrupole oscillations are generated via resonant two-photon

Matter motion is expressed by the motion transformation of basic vectors of

Phys. 38 (2005) 4171-4183","10.1088/0953-4075/38/23/001",,"quant-ph cond-mat.soft",,"  We study the influence of two resonant laser beams (to be referred to as the
control and probe beams) on the centre of mass motion of ultra-cold atoms
characterised by three energy levels of the Lambda-type. The laser beams being
in the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) configuration drive the
atoms to their dark states. We impose the adiabatic approximation and obtain an
effective equation of motion for the dark state atoms. The equation contains a
vector potential type interaction as well as an effective trapping potential.
We concentrate on the situation where the control and probe beams are
co-propagating and have Orbital Angular Momenta (OAM). The effective magnetic
field is then oriented along the propagation direction of the control and probe
beams. Its spatial profile can be shaped by choosing proper laser beams. We
analyse several situations where the effective magnetic field exhibits a radial
dependence. In particular we study effective magnetic fields induced by Bessel
beams, and demonstrate how to generate a constant effective magnetic field for
a ring geometry of the atomic trap. We also discuss a possibility to create an
effective field of a magnetic monopole.

processes that perform the optimal approximate cloning have been found in many
cases. These ""quantum cloning machines"" are important tools for studying a wide
variety of tasks, e.g. state estimation and eavesdropping on quantum
cryptography. This paper provides a comprehensive review of quantum cloning
machines (both for discrete-dimensional and for continuous-variable quantum
systems); in addition, it presents the role of cloning in quantum cryptography,
the link between optimal cloning and light amplification via stimulated
emission, and the experimental demonstrations of optimal quantum cloning.

structures such as networks and rings having potential barriers in their arms.
We find the generic presence of Hartman effect, with superluminal velocities as
a consequence, in these systems. In quantum networks it is possible to control
the `super arrival' time in one of the arms by changing the parameters on
another arm which is spatially separated from it. This is yet another quantum
nonlocal effect. Negative time delays (time advancement) and `ultra Hartman
effect' with negative saturation times have been observed in some parameter
regimes. In presence and absence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux quantum rings show
Hartman effect. We obtain the analytical expression for the saturated phase
time. In the opaque barrier regime this is independent of even the AB flux
thereby generalizing the Hartman effect. We also briefly discuss the concept of
""space collapse or space destroyer"" by introducing a free space in between two
barriers covering the ring. Further we show in presence of absorption the
reflection phase time exhibits Hartman effect in contrast to the transmission
phase time.

  quantum dynamics","12 pages + 4 figures, revised, added more sections and numerical
  illustrations",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We derive exact relations and general inequalities that extend the usual
time-energy uncertainty relations from the domain of unitary Hamiltonian
dynamics to that of dissipative dynamics as described by a broad class of
linear and nonlinear evolution equations for the density operator. For
non-dissipative dynamics, by using the Schroedinger inequality instead of the
Heisenberg-Robertson inequality, we obtain a general exact time-energy
uncertainty relation which is sharper than the usual Mandelstam-Tamm-Messiah
relation $\tau_F\Delta_H\ge \hbar/2$. For simultaneous unitary/dissipative
dynamics, the usual time-energy uncertainty relation is replaced by a less
restrictive relation that depends on the characteristic time of dissipation,
$\tau$, and the uncertainty associated with the generalized nonequilibrium
Massieu-function operator which defines the structure of the dissipative part
of the assumed class of evolution equations. Within the steepest-entropy-ascent
dissipative quantum dynamics of an isolated system introduced earlier by this
author, we obtain the interesting time-energy and time-entropy uncertainty
relation $(2\tau_F\Delta_H/ \hbar)^2+ (\tau_F\Delta_S/k_B\tau)^2 \ge 1$. We
illustrate this result and various other inequalities by means of numerical
simulations.
