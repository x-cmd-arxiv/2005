21 cm radiation from before and during the epoch of reionization (EOR) to
reconstruct the matter density fluctuations along the line of sight. To do so
we generalize the quadratic methods developed for the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) to 21 cm fluctuations. We show that the three dimensional
signal can be decomposed into a finite number of line of sight Fourier modes
that contribute to the lensing reconstruction. Our formalism properly takes
account of correlations along the line of sight and uses all the information
contained in quadratic combinations of the signal. In comparison with the CMB,
21 cm fluctuations have the disadvantage of a relatively scale invariant
unlensed power spectrum which suppresses the lensing effect. The smallness of
the lensing effect is compensated by using information from a range of observed
redshifts. We estimate the size of experiments that are needed to measure this
effect. With a square kilometer of collecting area and a maximal baseline of 3
km one can achieve lensing reconstruction noise levels an order of magnitude
below CMB quadratic estimator constraints at L=1000, and map the deflection
field out to less then a tenth of a degree (L> 2000) within a season of
observations on one field. Statistical lensing power spectrum detections will
be possible to sub-arcminute scales, even with the limited sky coverage that
currently conceived experiments have. One should be able to improve constraints
on cosmological parameters by using this method. With larger collecting areas
or longer observing times, one could probe arcminute scales of the lensing
potential and thus individual clusters. We address the effect that foregrounds
might have on lensing reconstruction with 21 cm fluctuations.

the magnetic interaction with the disk through closed field lines and with

assumes that the abundance anomalies shown by the stars in many clusters are
due to a second stage of star formation occurring from the matter lost by the
winds of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Until today, the
modellizations of the AGB evolution by several different groups failed, for
different reasons, to account for the patterns of chemical anomalies. Here we
show that our own modelling can provide a consistent picture if we constrain
the three main parameters which regulate AGB evolution: 1) adopting a high
efficiency convection model; 2) adopting rates of mass loss with a high
dependence on the stellar luminosity; 3) assuming a very small overshooting
below the formal convective regions during the thermal pulse (TP) phase. The
first assumption is needed to obtain an efficient oxygen depletion in the AGB
envelopes, and the second one is needed to lose the whole stellar envelope
within few thermal pulses, so that the sum of CNO elements does not increase
too much, consistently with the observations. The third assumption is needed to
fully understand the sodium production. We also show that the Mg - Al
anticorrelation is explained adopting the higher limit of the NACRE rates for
proton captures by Mg25 and Mg26, and the models are consistent with the
recently discovered F-Al correlation. Problems remain to fully explain the
observed Mg isotopes ratios.

  A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20054556",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent far-ultraviolet (FUV) absorption line measurements of low-redshift
quasars have unveiled a population of intervening broad HI Lya absorbers (BLAs)
with large Doppler parameters (b> 40 km/s). If the large width of these lines
is dominated by thermal line broadening, the BLAs may trace highly-ionized gas
in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in the temperature range T ~
10^5-10^6 K, a gas phase that is expected to contain a large fraction of the
baryons at low redshift. In this paper we use a hydrodynamical simulation to
study frequency, distribution, physical conditions, and baryon content of the
BLAs at z=0. From our simulated spectra we derive a number of BLAs per unit
redshift of (dN/dz)_BLA ~ 38 for HI absorbers with log (N(cm^-2)/b(km/s))>10.7,
b>40 km/s, and log N(HII)<20.5. The baryon content of these systems is
Omega_b(BLA)=0.0121/h_65, which represents ~25 percent of the total baryon
budget in our simulation. Our results thus support the idea that BLAs represent
a significant baryon reservoir at low redshift. BLAs predominantly trace
shock-heated collisionally ionized WHIM gas at temperatures log T~4.4-6.2.
About 27 percent of the BLAs in our simulation originate in the photoionized
Lya forest (log T<4.3) and their large line widths are determined by
non-thermal broadening effects such as unresolved velocity structure and
macroscopic turbulence. Our simulation implies that for a large-enough sample
of BLAs in FUV spectra it is possible to obtain a reasonable approximation of
the baryon content of these systems solely from the measured HI column
densities and b values.

in TeV BL Lac object based on the Self Synchrotron Compton (SSC) models are in
strong disagreement with those deduced from the unification models between
blazars and radio galaxies. When corrected from extragalactic absorption by the
diffuse infrared background (DIrB), the SSC one-zone models require very high
Lorentz factor (around 50) to avoid strong gamma-gamma absorption. However, the
statistics on beamed vs. unbeamed objects, as well as the luminosity contrast,
favors much lower Lorentz factor of the order of 3. In this paper, we show that
for the special case of Markarian 501, the need for very high Lorentz factor is
unavoidable for all one-zone models where all photons are assumed to be
produced at the same location at the same time. Models assuming a double
structure with two different beaming patterns can partially solve the problem
of luminosity contrast, but we point out that they are inconsistent with the
statistics on the number of detected TeV sources. The only way to solve the
issue is to consider inhomogeneous models, where low energy and high energy
photons are not produced at the same place, allowing for much smaller Lorentz
factors. It implies that the jet is stratified, but also that the particle
energy distribution is close to a monoenergetic one, and that pair production
is likely to be significant. The implications on relativistic jet physics and
particle acceleration mechanism are discussed.

code modified for magnetic diffusivity, our simulations evolve from an initial
hydrostatic equilibrium state in a force-free magnetic field. Considering a
power law for the disk poloidal magnetic field profile Bp ~ r^{-mu} and for the
disk wind density profile rho ~ r^{-mu_rho} we performed a systematic study
over a wide parameter range mu and mu_rho. We find a degree of collimation
(ratio of mass flow rates in axial and lateral direction) decreasing for
steeper disk magnetic field profiles (increasing mu). Varying the total
magnetic flux doesn't change the degree of jet collimation substantially, it
only affects the time scale of outflow evolution and the terminal jet speed. As
our major result we find a general relation between the collimation degree with
the disk wind magnetization power law exponent. Outflows with high collimation
degree resulting from a flat disk magnetic field profile tend to be unsteady,
producing axially propagating knots as discussed earlier. Depending slightly on
the inflow density profile this unsteady behavior sets in for mu < 0.4. We also
performed simulations of jet formation with artificially enhanced decay of the
toroidal magnetic field in order to investigate the idea of a purely ""poloidal
collimation"" discussed in the literature. These outflows remain weakly
collimated and propagate with lower velocity. Thanks to our large numerical
grid size (7x14 AU for protostars), we may apply our results to recently
observed hints of jet rotation (DG Tau) indicating a relatively flat disk
magnetic field profile, mu ~ 0.5. In general, our results are applicable to
both stellar and extragalactic sources of MHD jets.

(at a temperature contrast of 4-8 percent, with a projected surface coverage

inevitably arises in ordinary disordered wires. A counterexample is recently
found in the systems with symplectic symmetry, where one perfectly conducting
channel is present even in the long-wire limit when the number of conducting
channels is odd. This indicates that the odd-channel case is essentially
different from the ordinary even-channel case. To study such differences, we
derive the DMPK equation for transmission eigenvalues for both the even- and
odd- channel cases. The behavior of dimensionless conductance is investigated
on the basis of the resulting equation. In the short-wire regime, we find that
the weak-antilocalization correction to the conductance in the odd-channel case
is equivalent to that in the even-channel case. We also find that the variance
does not depend on whether the number of channels is even or odd. In the
long-wire regime, it is shown that the dimensionless conductance in the
even-channel case decays exponentially as <g_even> --> 0 with increasing system
length, while <g_odd> --> 1 in the odd-channel case. We evaluate the decay
length for the even- and odd-channel cases and find a clear even-odd

of the Tkachenko modes are isotropic, while for other lattice types the

  Experimental Data","Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Hawaii, In press, Accepted, 2006",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI",,"  Protein-protein and protein nucleic acid interactions are vitally important
for a wide range of biological processes, including regulation of gene
expression, protein synthesis, and replication and assembly of many viruses. We
have developed machine learning approaches for predicting which amino acids of
a protein participate in its interactions with other proteins and/or nucleic
acids, using only the protein sequence as input. In this paper, we describe an
application of classifiers trained on datasets of well-characterized
protein-protein and protein-RNA complexes for which experimental structures are
available. We apply these classifiers to the problem of predicting protein and
RNA binding sites in the sequence of a clinically important protein for which
the structure is not known: the regulatory protein Rev, essential for the
replication of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses. We compare our predictions with
published biochemical, genetic and partial structural information for HIV-1 and
EIAV Rev and with our own published experimental mapping of RNA binding sites
in EIAV Rev. The predicted and experimentally determined binding sites are in
very good agreement. The ability to predict reliably the residues of a protein
that directly contribute to specific binding events - without the requirement
for structural information regarding either the protein or complexes in which
it participates - can potentially generate new disease intervention strategies.

  Communication and Technology (2005) 3217-3220",,,"cs.CL",,"  The goal of this work is to recover articulatory information from the speech
signal by acoustic-to-articulatory inversion. One of the main difficulties with
inversion is that the problem is underdetermined and inversion methods
generally offer no guarantee on the phonetical realism of the inverse
solutions. A way to adress this issue is to use additional phonetic
constraints. Knowledge of the phonetic caracteristics of French vowels enable
the derivation of reasonable articulatory domains in the space of Maeda
parameters: given the formants frequencies (F1,F2,F3) of a speech sample, and
thus the vowel identity, an ""ideal"" articulatory domain can be derived. The
space of formants frequencies is partitioned into vowels, using either
speaker-specific data or generic information on formants. Then, to each
articulatory vector can be associated a phonetic score varying with the
distance to the ""ideal domain"" associated with the corresponding vowel.
Inversion experiments were conducted on isolated vowels and vowel-to-vowel
transitions. Articulatory parameters were compared with those obtained without
using these constraints and those measured from X-ray data.

investigate the recently proposed possibility that split fermion models --
extra dimensional models where the standard model fermions are localized to
different points around the extra dimension -- could provide a means to
generate this asymmetry during the phase transition of the localizing scalars.
After setting up the scenario that we consider, we use a single fermion toy
model to estimate the reflection coefficients for scattering off the phase
boundary using a more realistic scalar profile than previous work resulting in
a different Kaluza Klein spectrum. The value we calculate for $n_B/s$ is
consistent with the mechanism being the source of the baryon asymmetry of our
universe provided the $B-L$ violating processes have an efficiency of order
$10^{-5}$.

  177-196",,"DSF-2003-42","math-ph math.MP",,"  The concepts of symmetry and symmetry groups are at the heart of several
developments in modern theoretical and mathematical physics. The present paper
is devoted to a number of selected topics within this framework: Euclidean and
rotation groups; the properties of fullerenes in physical chemistry; Galilei,
Lorentz and Poincare groups; conformal transformations and the Laplace
equation; quantum groups and Sklyanin algebras. For example, graphite can be
vaporized by laser irradiation, producing a remarkably stable cluster
consisting of 60 carbon atoms. The corresponding theoretical model considers a
truncated icosahedron, i.e. a polygon with 60 vertices and 32 faces, 12 of
which are pentagonal and 20 hexagonal. The Carbon 60 molecule obtained when a
carbon atom is placed at each vertex of this structure has all valences
satisfied by two single bonds and one double bond. In other words, a structure
in which a pentagon is completely surrounded by hexagons is stable. Thus, a
cage in which all 12 pentagons are completely surrounded by hexagons has
optimum stability. On a more formal side, the exactly solvable models of
quantum and statistical physics can be studied with the help of the quantum
inverse problem method. The problem of enumerating the discrete quantum systems
which can be solved by the quantum inverse problem method reduces to the
problem of enumerating the operator-valued functions that satisfy an equation
involving a fixed solution of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation. Two basic
equations exist which provide a systematic procedure for obtaining completely
integrable lattice approximations to various continuous completely integrable
systems. This analysis leads in turn to the discovery of Sklyanin algebras.

we show q-variation regularity of Cameron-Martin paths associated to fractional
Brownian motion and other Volterra processes. This is useful, for instance, to
establish large deviations for enhanced fractional Brownian motion. Second, the
q-variation embedding, combined with results of rough path theory, provides a
different route to a regularity result for stochastic differential equations by
Kusuoka. Third, the embedding theorem works in a non-commutative setting and
can be used to establish Hoelder/variation regularity of rough paths.

regression; the goal is to predict each consecutive response given the
corresponding explanatory variables and all the previous observations. We are
mainly interested in prediction intervals rather than point predictions. The
standard treatment of prediction intervals in linear regression analysis has
two drawbacks: (1) the classical prediction intervals guarantee that the
probability of error is equal to the nominal significance level epsilon, but
this property per se does not imply that the long-run frequency of error is
close to epsilon; (2) it is not suitable for prediction of complex systems as
it assumes that the number of observations exceeds the number of parameters. We
state a general result showing that in the on-line protocol the frequency of
error for the classical prediction intervals does equal the nominal
significance level, up to statistical fluctuations. We also describe
alternative regression models in which informative prediction intervals can be
found before the number of observations exceeds the number of parameters. One
of these models, which only assumes that the observations are independent and
identically distributed, is popular in machine learning but greatly underused
in the statistical theory of regression.

where the $\eta p$ final state originates dominantly from the decay of the

(at the peak of the S11 resonance) is $E_\gamma^{Lab} = $3 GeV. We will discuss
it somewhat above threshold, at $E_\gamma^{Lab}\simeq 4-5$ GeV, in order to
reach lower (absolute) values of the squared 4-momentum transfer from the
initial photon to the final $\phi$-meson. In these conditions, we expect the
t-channel $\pi^0$- and $\eta$-meson exchanges to drive the dynamics underlying
the $\gamma p \to \phi \eta p$ process. The initial photon dissociates into the
final $\phi$-meson and a virtual pseudoscalar meson ($\pi^0$ or $\eta$). The
virtual pseudoscalar meson scatters from the proton target to produce the final
$\eta p$ state. The $\pi^0 p \to \eta p$ and $\eta p \to \eta p$ amplitudes are
derived in the framework of a coupled-channel effective field theory of
meson-baryon scattering. We found the $\eta$-meson exchange to be largely
dominant. The $\eta$-$\pi^0$ interference is of the order of $20 - 30 %$. The
sign of this term is not known and has a significant influence on the results.
The $\pi N\to \eta N$ amplitude being largely determined by data on the $\pi^-
p \to \eta n$ reaction, we found that the $\gamma p \to \phi \eta p$ reaction
cross section is rather directly related to the $\eta$-nucleon scattering

frequencies beat at the circular frequency, a no-radiation condition. The
resonant orbits turn out to have unperturbed orbital angular momenta that are

  Quantum Electrodynamics","48 pages,3 figures",,,,"quant-ph physics.atom-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Based on the precision experimental data of energy-level differences in
hydrogenlike atoms, especially the 1S-2S transition of hydrogen and deuterium,
the necessity of establishing a reduced Dirac equation (RDE) with reduced mass
as the substitution of original electron mass is stressed. The theoretical
basis of RDE lies on two symmetries, the invariance under the space-time
inversion and that under the pure space inversion. Based on RDE and within the
framework of quantum electrodynamics in covariant form, the Lamb shift can be
evaluated (at one-loop level) as the radiative correction on a bound electron
staying in an off-mass-shell state--a new approach eliminating the infrared
divergence. Hence the whole calculation, though with limited accuracy, is
simplified, getting rid of all divergences and free of ambiguity.

technology: individual atoms can support quantum superpositions for long
periods, and such atoms can in principle be embedded in a permanent molecular
scaffolding to form an array. This would be true nanotechnology, with
dimensions of order of a nanometre. However, the challenges of realising such a
vision are immense. One must identify a suitable elementary unit and
demonstrate its merits for qubit storage and manipulation, including input /
output. These units must then be formed into large arrays corresponding to an
functional quantum architecture, including a mechanism for gate operations.
Here we report our efforts, both experimental and theoretical, to create such a
technology based on endohedral fullerenes or 'buckyballs'. We describe our
successes with respect to these criteria, along with the obstacles we are
currently facing and the questions that remain to be addressed.

  influence of noise without measuring",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.032324",,"quant-ph",,"  The problem of automatically protecting a quantum system against noise in a
closed circuit is analyzed. A general scheme is developed built from two steps.
At first, a distillation step is induced in which undesired components are
removed to another degree of freedom of the system. Later a recovering step is
employed which the system gains back its initial density. An Optimal-Control
method is used to generate the distilling operator. The scheme is demonstrated
by a simulation of a two level byte influenced by white noise. Undesired
deviations from the target were shown to be reduced by at least two orders of
magnitude on average. The relations between the quantum version of the
classical Watt's Governor and the field of quantum information are also
discussed.

direct product theorem for 2-sided error quantum algorithms computing k
independent instances of a symmetric Boolean function: if the algorithm uses
significantly less than k times the number of queries needed for one instance
of the function, then its success probability is exponentially small in k. We
also use the polynomial method to prove a direct product theorem for 1-sided
error algorithms for k threshold functions with a stronger bound on the success
probability. Finally, we present a quantum algorithm for evaluating solutions
to systems of linear inequalities, and use our direct product theorems to show
that the time-space tradeoff of this algorithm is close to optimal.

entanglement of intense light beams. We demonstrate all three methods using the
same set--up to facilitate the comparison. The non--linearity used to generate
entanglement is the Kerr--effect in optical fibres. Due to the brightness of
the entangled pulses, standard homodyne detection is not an appropriate tool
for the verification. However, we show that by using large asymmetric
interferometers on each beam individually, two non-commuting variables can be
accessed and the presence of entanglement verified via joint measurements on
the two beams. Alternatively, we witness entanglement by combining the two
beams on a beam splitter that yields certain linear combinations of quadrature
amplitudes which suffice to prove the presence of entanglement.

we provide a solution for the problem of estimating the unknown unitary action

this case the optimal measurements do not coincide with the so called
square-root measurements. In the case of squeezing and displacement we analyze
in detail the sensitivity of estimation for coherent states and displaced
squeezed states, deriving the asymptotic relation between the uncertainties in
the joint estimation and the corresponding uncertainties in the optimal
separate measurements of squeezing and displacement. A two-mode setup is also
analyzed, showing how entanglement between optical modes can be used to
approximate perfect estimation.
