we evaluate the possible periods of disk precession and nutation due to the

and a typical intrinsic time dependence for the burst, we find possible
gamma-ray light curves with temporal microstructure similar to what is observed
in some subsamples. We conclude that the precession and nutation of a

basis of the AMIGA project. Comparison with independent classifications made
for an SDSS overlap sample of more than 200 galaxies confirms the reliability
of the early vs. late-type discrimination and the accuracy of spiral subtypes
within DeltaT = 1-2. CCD images taken at the OSN were also used to solve
ambiguities. 193 galaxies are flagged for the presence of nearby companions or
signs of distortion likely due to interaction. This most isolated sample of
galaxies in the local Universe is dominated by 2 populations: 1) 82% spirals
(Sa-Sd) with the bulk being luminous systems with small bulges (63% between
types Sb-Sc) and 2) a significant population of early-type E-S0 galaxies (14%).
Most of the types later than Sd are low luminosity galaxies concentrated in the
local supercluster where isolation is difficult to evaluate. The late-type
spiral majority of the sample spans a luminosity range M_B-corr = -18 to -22
mag. Few of the E/S0 population are more luminous than -21.0 marking an absence
of, an often sought, super L* merger (eg fossil elliptical) population. The
rarity of high luminosity systems results in a fainter derived M* for this
population compared to the spiral optical luminosity function (OLF). The E-S0
population is from 0.2 to 0.6 mag fainter depending how the sample is defined.
This marks the AMIGA sample as almost unique among samples that compare early
and late-type OLFs separately. In other samples, which always involve galaxies
in higher density environments, M*(E/S0) is almost always 0.3-0.5 mag brighter
than M*(S), presumably reflecting a stronger correlation between M* and
environmental density for early-type galaxies.

derive important results on the physical structures on a range of sizes from

types from 6495 galaxies with 17.5<=I_AB<=24 and measured spectroscopic
redshift in the first epoch VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey. We classify our sample into
4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energy
distributions on observed multi-color data. We measure the projected function
wp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-space
correlation function. We find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies to
be markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up to
z<=1.2. At z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation length
r_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}Mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}Mpc. The
clustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}Mpc for z~1.4.
The relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within our
magnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 from
z~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z>1.2, due to the growth
in clustering of the star-forming population. We find similar results when
splitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed color
bi-modality. When compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,
a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly of
massive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest dark
matter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located in
higher-density, more clustered regions of the Universe at z~=1.5 than at
present, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,
going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominated
by old galaxies.

nearby merging galaxies and starburst (SB) galaxies indicate a premature death
of the young clusters. The fate of an evolving star cluster crucially depends
of its gas content. This behaves like a glue that helps to keep the star system
gravitationally bound. In SB systems where the rate of supernovae (SNe)
explosions is elevated one should expect an efficient heating of the gas and
its complete removal which could then favor the rapid dissociation of the
evolving star clusters. Based on a contemporaneous study of the dynamical
evolution of the interstellar gas in SB environments (Melioli & de Gouveia Dal
Pino 2004) where it has been considered also the presence of dense clouds that
may inhibit the heating efficiency of the interstellar gas by the SNe, we have
here computed the timescales for gas removal from young clusters embedded in
these systems and found that they are consistent with the very short timescales
for cluster dissolution which are inferred from the observational studies
above. Our results indicate that typical SB proto-clusters should start to
disperse after less than 5 Myr. For a given total gas mass content, this result
is nearly insensitive to the initial star formation efficiency.

origin, and if so extract further information that may be helpful for
identifying its causes. Here we propose a new directional indicator, based on
angular-separation histograms of pairs of pixels with similar temperatures in
the CMB map, which provides a measure of departure from statistical isotropy.
The main advantage of this indicator is that it can be used to generate a sky
map of large-scale anisotropies in the CMB temperature map, thus allowing a
possible additional window into their causes. Using this indicator, we find a
statistically significant (at 95% CL) preferred direction in the CMB data and
discuss how it compares with other such axes recently reported. We also show
that our findings are robust with respect to both the details of the method
used, and the choice of the WMAP CMB maps employed, including the three-year

consists of over 1600 galaxy cluster members, of which two thirds are outside
r_200. We assign cluster membership using a detailed mass model and expand on
our previous work on the cluster colour-magnitude relation where membership was
inferred statistically. We confirm that the modal colours of galaxies on the
colour magnitude relation become progressively bluer with increasing radius and
decreasing local galaxy density. Interpreted as an age effect, we hypothesize
that these trends in galaxy colour should be reflected in mean Hdelta
equivalent width. We confirm that passive galaxies in the cluster increase in
Hdelta line strength as dHdelta / d r_p = 0.35 +/- 0.06. A variation of star
formation rate, as measured by [OII], with increasing local density of the
environment is discernible and is shown to be in broad agreement with previous
studies from 2dFGRS and SDSS. We find that clusters at z~0.1 are less active
than their higher redshift analogues. We also investigate unusual populations
of blue and very red nonstarforming galaxies and we suggest that the former are
likely to be the progenitors of galaxies which will lie on the colour-magnitude
relation, while the colours of the latter possibly reflect dust reddening. The
cluster galaxies at large radii consist of both backsplash ones and those that
are infalling to the cluster for the first time. We make a comparison to the
field population at z~0.1 and examine broad differences between the two

  Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20053644",,"astro-ph",,"  Curved broad-band spectral distributions of non-thermal sources like blazars
are described well by a log-parabolic (LP) law where the second degree term
measures the curvature. LP energy spectra can be obtained for relativistic
electrons by means of a statistical acceleration mechanism whose probability of
acceleration depends on energy. In this paper we compute the spectra radiated
by an electron population via synchrotron (S) and Synchro-Self Compton(SSC)
processes to derive the relations between the LP parameters. These spectra were
obtained by means of an accurate numerical code. We found that the ratio
between the curvature parameters of the S spectrum to that of the electrons is
equal to about 0.2 instead of 0.25, the value foreseen in the delta
approximation. Inverse Compton spectra are also intrinsically curved and can be
approximated by a log-parabola only in limited ranges. The curvature parameter,
estimated around the SED peak, may vary from a lower value than that of the S
spectrum up to that of emitting electrons depending on whether the scattering
is in the Thomson or in the Klein-Nishina regime. We applied this analysis to
computing the SSC emission from the BL Lac object Mkn 501 during the large
flare of April 1997. We fit simultaneous BeppoSAX and CAT data and reproduced
intensities and spectral curvatures of both components with good accuracy. The
large curvature observed in the TeV range was found to be mainly intrinsic, and
therefore did not require a large pair production absorption against the
extragalactic background. We regard this finding as an indication that the
Universe is more transparent at these energies than previously assumed by
several models found in the literature. This conclusion is supported by recent
detection of two relatively high redshift blazars with H.E.S.S.

They are not localized in the interior of the large chaotic cavity. In other

closely follows the profile of the resonances. In all considered cases, the
phase rigidity fluctuates with energy. It is mostly near to its maximum value

dimensional matter inheriting vectors even for the degenerate case. The
non-degenerate case provides finite dimensional matter inheriting symmetries.
We obtain different constraints on the energy-momentum tensor in each case. It
is interesting to note that if the inheriting factor vanishes, matter
inheriting collineations reduce to be matter collineations already available in
the literature. This idea of matter inheritance collineations turn out to be
the same as homotheties and conformal Killing vectors are for the metric
tensor.

finally returns home with the same speed when the siblings can compare their

energy into the produced matter. It has been proposed that as such matter
behaves as a liquid with a very small viscosity, a fraction of this energy goes
into a collective excitation called the ``conical flow'', similar e.g. to the
sonic booms generated by the supersonic planes. In this work we study the
effect of time-dependent speed of sound on the development of the conical wave.
We show that the expansion of matter and the decrease of $c_s$ leads to an
increase of observable manifestations of the conical flow. We also show that if
the QCD phase transition is of the first order (and thus with vanishing speed
of sound in the mixed phase) the wave must split into two, with opposite
directions. We then argue that it is not the case experimentally, which
supports the conclusion that the QCD phase transition is $not$ of the first

nonabelian theories are analysed for both constants, \alpha = g^2 / 4\pi and
\tilde\alpha = {\tilde g}^2 / 4\pi. The pure SU(3) \times \widetilde{SU(3)}
gauge theory is investigated as an example. We consider not only monopoles, but
also dyons. The behaviour of the total SU(3) \beta-function is investigated in
the whole region of \alpha \equiv \alpha_s: 0 \le \alpha < \infty. It is shown
that this \beta-function is antisymmetric under the interchange \alpha
\longleftrightarrow 1/\alpha and is given by the well-known perturbative
expansion not only for \alpha \ll 1, but also for \alpha \gg 1. Using an idea
of the Maximal Abelian Projection by t' Hooft, we considered the formation of
strings - the ANO flux tubes - in the Higgs model of scalar monopole (or dyon)
fields. In this model we have constructed the behaviour of the \beta-function
in the vicinity of the point \alpha = 1, where it acquires a zero value.
Considering the phase transition points at \alpha \approx 0.4 and \alpha
\approx 2.5, we give the explanation of the freezing of \alpha_s. The evolution
of \alpha_s^{-1}(\mu) and the behaviour of V_{eff}(\mu) are investigated for
both, perturbative and non-perturbative regions of QCD. It was shown that the
effective potential has a minimum, ensured by the dual sector of QCD. The gluon
condensate F^2_0, corresponding to this minimum, is predicted: F^2_0 \approx
0.15 GeV^4, in agreement with the well-known results.

If, as is particularly natural in quantum cosmology, the spatial sections of an
accelerating cosmological model are flat and compact, then the spacetime is on
the brink of disaster: it turns out that the version of inflationary spacetime
geometry with toral spatial sections is marginally stable in the Seiberg-Witten
sense. The question is whether the system remains stable before and after
Inflation, when the spacetime geometry is distorted away from the inflationary
form but still has flat spatial sections. We show that it is indeed possible to
avoid disaster, but that requiring stability at all times imposes non-trivial
conditions on the spacetime geometry of the early Universe in string cosmology.
This in turn allows us to suggest a candidate for the structure which, in the
earliest Universe, forbids cosmological singularities.

by means of a similarity transformation to a physically equivalent Hermitian
Hamiltonian. This raises the following question: In which form of the quantum
theory, the non-Hermitian or the Hermitian one, is it easier to perform
calculations? This paper compares both forms of a non-Hermitian $ix^3$
quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian and demonstrates that it is much harder to
perform calculations in the Hermitian theory because the perturbation series
for the Hermitian Hamiltonian is constructed from divergent Feynman graphs. For
the Hermitian version of the theory, dimensional continuation is used to
regulate the divergent graphs that contribute to the ground-state energy and
the one-point Green's function. The results that are obtained are identical to
those found much more simply and without divergences in the non-Hermitian
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The $\mathcal{O}(g^4)$ contribution to the
ground-state energy of the Hermitian version of the theory involves graphs with
overlapping divergences, and these graphs are extremely difficult to regulate.
In contrast, the graphs for the non-Hermitian version of the theory are finite
to all orders and they are very easy to evaluate.

energy of the corresponding annealed system. This bound may be improved by
applying the annealing procedure, which is just Jensen inequality, after having
modified the Hamiltonian in a way that the quenched expressions are left
unchanged. This procedure is often viewed as a partial annealing or as a
constrained annealing, in the sense that the term that is added may be
interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier on the disorder variables.
  In this note we point out that, for a family of models, some of which have
attracted much attention, the multipliers of the form of empirical averages of
local functions cannot improve on the basic annealed bound from the viewpoint
of characterizing the phase diagram. This class of multipliers is the one that
is suitable for computations and it is often believed that in this class one

such that $f$ is Gateaux differentiable at all $x\in S(f)\setminus A$, where
$S(f)$ is the set of points where $f$ is pointwise-Lipschitz. This improves a
result of Bongiorno. As a corollary, we obtain that every $K$-monotone function

belonging to $\tilde\mcC$; this improves a result due to Borwein and Wang.
Another corollary is that if $X$ is Asplund, $f:X\to\R$ cone monotone,
$g:X\to\R$ continuous convex, then there exists a point in $X$, where $f$ is
Hadamard differentiable and $g$ is Frechet differentiable.

relating a static magnetic field to its source terms, the total power can be
written as a sum of crosscorrelation products between the magnetic field data
set and the theoretical expression of the magnetic field generated by a source
element of unitary strength. Then, applying Schwarz's inequality, an occurrence
probability function is derived for imaging any distribution of magnetic
anomaly sources in the subsurface. The tomographic procedure consists in
scanning the half-space below the survey area by the unitary source and in
computing the occurrence probability function at the nodes of a regular grid
within the half-space. The grid values are finally contoured in order to single
out the zones with high probability of occurrence of buried magnetic anomaly
sources. Synthetic and field examples are discussed to test the resolution
power of the proposed tomography.

employed for generating the trains of few-femtosecond electromagnetic (EM)
pulses in rarefied plasmas. The EPW produces a co-moving index grating that
induces a laser phase modulation at the difference frequency. The bandwidth of
the phase-modulated laser is proportional to the product of the plasma length,
laser wavelength, and amplitude of the electron density perturbation. The laser
spectrum is composed of a cascade of red and blue sidebands shifted by integer
multiples of the beat frequency. When the beat frequency is lower than the
electron plasma frequency, the red-shifted spectral components are advanced in
time with respect to the blue-shifted ones near the center of each laser
beatnote. The group velocity dispersion of plasma compresses so chirped
beatnotes to a few-laser-cycle duration thus creating a train of sharp EM
spikes with the beat periodicity. Depending on the plasma and laser parameters,
chirping and compression can be implemented either concurrently in the same, or
sequentially in different plasmas. Evolution of the laser beatwave end electron
density perturbations is described in time and one spatial dimension in a
weakly relativistic approximation. Using the compression effect, we demonstrate
that the relativistic bi-stability regime of the EPW excitation [G. Shvets,

signature. The main goal of this field is to take advantage of quantum effects
to provide unconditionally secure signature. We present a quantum signature
scheme with message recovery without using entangle effect. The most important
property of the proposed scheme is that it is not necessary for the scheme to
use Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The present scheme utilizes single
photons to achieve the aim of signature and verification. The security of the
scheme relies on the quantum one-time pad and quantum key distribution. The
efficiency analysis shows that the proposed scheme is an efficient scheme.
