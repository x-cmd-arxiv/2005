resolution dilutes even the radial signal and will be a serious limitation for
resolving small bubbles before the end of reionization. Nonlinear redshift
space distortions suggest that a resolution of order 1 -- 10\arcsec and a
frequency resolution of 10kHz will ultimately be desirable to extract the full

We found that isotropic electric fields decrease the degree of linear

On the other hand, a distribution of isotropic electric fields superimposed
onto a deterministic magnetic field can generate a significant increase of the
degree of magnetic-induced, net circular polarization. This phenomenon has
important implications for the diagnostics of magnetic fields in plasmas using
hydrogen lines, because of the ubiquitous presence of the Holtsmark,
microscopic electric field from neighbouring ions. In particular, previous
solar magnetographic studies of the Balmer lines of hydrogen may need to be
revised because they neglected the effect of turbulent electric fields on the

emission phase, a very bright optical flare was detected, and it was temporal
coincident with an X-ray flare. Here we use two models to explain the optical
flare, One is the ""late internal shock model"", in which the optical flare is
produced by the synchrotron radiation of the electrons accelerated by the late
internal shock, and the X-ray flare is produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton
mechanism. The other is the external forward-reverse shock model, in which the
optical flare is from the reverse shock emission and the X-ray flare is
attributed to the central engine activity. We show that with proper parameters,
a bright optical flare can appear in both models. We think the ""late internal
shock model"" is more favored since in this model the optical flash and the
X-ray flare have the same origin, which provides a natural explanation of the
temporal coincidence of them. In the forward-reverse shock scenario, fits to
the optical flare and the late afterglow suggests that the physical parameters

correlated growth of surface roughness is expected at a characteristic time
t_0. This crossover is analyzed in lattice models via scaling arguments, with
support from simulation results presented here and in other authors works. We
argue that the amplitudes of the saturation roughness and of the saturation
time scale as {t_0}^{1/2} and t_0, respectively. For models with lateral
aggregation, which typically are in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class, we
show that t_0 ~ 1/p, where p is the probability of the correlated aggregation
mechanism to take place. However, t_0 ~ 1/p^2 is obtained in solid-on-solid
models with single particle deposition attempts. This group includes models in
various universality classes, with numerical examples being provided in the
Edwards-Wilkinson (EW), KPZ and Villain-Lai-Das Sarma (nonlinear molecular-beam
epitaxy) classes. Most applications are for two-component models in which
random deposition, with probability 1-p, competes with a correlated aggregation
process with probability p. However, our approach can be extended to other
systems with the same crossover, such as the generalized restricted
solid-on-solid model with maximum height difference S, for large S. Moreover,
the scaling approach applies to all dimensions. In the particular case of
one-dimensional KPZ processes with this crossover, we show that t_0 ~ nu^{-1}

and nonlinear terms of the associated KPZ equations. The applicability of

and spin concentration, the spins arrange themselves into a remarkable variety
of patterns at low temperatures $T$, including phase separation, checkerboard
order, and straight or labyrinthine patterns of stripes, which sometimes show
hints of nematic or smectic order. This pattern formation profoundly affects
the superfluid density, $\gamma$. Phase separation tends to enhance $\gamma$,
checkerboard order suppresses it, and stripe formation increases the component
of $\gamma$ parallel to the stripes and reduces the perpendicular one. We
verify that $\gamma(T = 0)$ is proportional to the effective conductance of a

be insulating perpendicular to the layers and metallic within them. This is the
phenomenon of confinement, a concept at odds with the conventional theory of
solids and recognized as due to magnetic and electron-lattice interactions in
the layers which must be overcome at a substantial energy cost if electrons are
to be transferred between layers. The associated energy gap or 'pseudogap' is
particularly obvious in experiments where charge is moved perpendicular to the

spectroscopy. Here, using the same experimental tools, we show that there is a
second family of TMOs - the layered manganites La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7 (LSMO) - with
even more extreme confinement and pseudogap effects. The data, which are the
first to resolve atoms in any metallic manganite, demonstrate quantitatively
that because they are attached to polarons - lattice and spin textures within

vacuum tunneling into a conventional metallic tip, as it is for them to move

  $\omega$-regular linear-time properties","39 pages","ACM Trans. Computational Logic 9(1), 2007","10.1145/1297658.1297663",,"cs.LO",,"  Lossy channel systems (LCSs) are systems of finite state automata that
communicate via unreliable unbounded fifo channels. In order to circumvent the
undecidability of model checking for nondeterministic
  LCSs, probabilistic models have been introduced, where it can be decided
whether a linear-time property holds almost surely. However, such fully
probabilistic systems are not a faithful model of nondeterministic protocols.
  We study a hybrid model for LCSs where losses of messages are seen as faults
occurring with some given probability, and where the internal behavior of the
system remains nondeterministic. Thus the semantics is in terms of
infinite-state Markov decision processes. The purpose of this article is to
discuss the decidability of linear-time properties formalized by formulas of
linear temporal logic (LTL). Our focus is on the qualitative setting where one
asks, e.g., whether a LTL-formula holds almost surely or with zero probability
(in case the formula describes the bad behaviors). Surprisingly, it turns out
that -- in contrast to finite-state Markov decision processes -- the
satisfaction relation for LTL formulas depends on the chosen type of schedulers
that resolve the nondeterminism. While all variants of the qualitative LTL
model checking problem for the full class of history-dependent schedulers are
undecidable, the same questions for finite-memory scheduler can be solved
algorithmically. However, the restriction to reachability properties and
special kinds of recurrent reachability properties yields decidable
verification problems for the full class of schedulers, which -- for this
restricted class of properties -- are as powerful as finite-memory schedulers,
or even a subclass of them.

world average for sin(2beta), measured in the theoretically and experimentally
cleanest charmonium modes, such as B -> J/psi K0s, is sin(2beta) = 0.685 +-
0.032. In addition to these tree-level dominated decays, independent
measurements of sin(2beta) are obtained from gluonic b --> s penguin decays,

somewhat weaker than earlier this year, that these measurements tend to come
out low compared to the charmonium average, giving rise to the tantalizing

corresponding loop diagrams. Clearly, more data from both experiments are
needed to elucidate these intriguing differences.

is generated, inducing a shift in the classical Chern-Simons coefficient.

survives. We draw from this case lessons on the full string-theoretical

present a unified approach, motivated by the theory of hamiltonian 2-forms (as

largely independent of that theory.
  We obtain a characterization, on a large family of projective bundles, of
those `admissible' Kaehler classes (i.e., the ones compatible with the bundle
structure in a way we make precise) which contain an extremal Kaehler metric.
In many cases, such as on geometrically ruled surfaces, every Kaehler class is
admissible. In particular, our results complete the classification of extremal
Kaehler metrics on geometrically ruled surfaces, answering several
long-standing questions.
  We also find that our characterization agrees with a notion of K-stability
for admissible Kaehler classes. Our examples and nonexistence results therefore
provide a fertile testing ground for the rapidly developing theory of stability
for projective varieties, and we discuss some of the ramifications. In
particular we obtain examples of projective varieties which are destabilized by
a non-algebraic degeneration.

potential energy surfaces as a function of the Ramachandran angles Phi and Psi,

particular degrees of freedom are essential for the characterization of
proteins folding process. Calculations have been carried out within ab initio
theoretical framework based on the density functional theory and accounting for
all the electrons in the system. We have determined stable conformations and
calculated the energy barriers for transitions between them. Using a
thermodynamic approach, we have estimated the times of characteristic
transitions between these conformations. The results of our calculations have
been compared with those obtained by other theoretical methods and with the
available experimental data extracted from the Protein Data Base. This
comparison demonstrates a reasonable correspondence of the most prominent
minima on the calculated potential energy surfaces to the experimentally
measured angles Phi and Psi for alanine chains appearing in native proteins. We
have also investigated the influence of the secondary structure of polypeptide
chains on the formation of the potential energy landscape. This analysis has

revived however, because they appear to provide a logically sound means of
relating classical and quantum theories. It is argued here that the Heisenberg

the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, where the fifth dimension of 5-spacetime
