Background (CMB) and matter power spectra, and the extent to which present
cosmological data can distinguish between a free streaming or tightly coupled
fluid of neutrinos. If neutrinos have strong non-standard interactions, for
example, through the coupling of neutrinos to a light boson, they may be kept
in equilibrium until late times. We show how the power spectra for these models
differ from more conventional neutrino scenarios, and use CMB and large scale
structure data to constrain these models. CMB polarization data improves the
constraints on the number of massless neutrinos, while the Lyman--$\alpha$
power spectrum improves the limits on the neutrino mass. Neutrino mass limits
depend strongly on whether some or all of the neutrino species interact and
annihilate. The present data can accommodate a number of tightly-coupled
relativistic degrees of freedom, and none of the interacting-neutrino scenarios
considered are ruled out by current data -- although considerations regarding
the age of the Universe disfavor a model with three annihilating neutrinos with
very large neutrino masses.

the luminosity of HCN. Our surveys of Galactic dense cores in HCN 1-0 emission

in solar active regions. For the first time, both the field-aligned and the
cross-field velocity components are reconstructed. The cross-field velocity
solution accounts for the changes of the vertical magnetic field seen between a
pair of successive active-region vector magnetograms via the ideal induction
equation. The field-aligned velocity is obtained using the Doppler velocity and
the calculated cross-field velocity. Solving the ideal induction equation in
vector magnetograms measured at a given altitude in the solar atmosphere is an
under-determined problem. In response, our general formalism allows the use of
any additional constraint for the inductive cross-field velocity to enforce a
unique solution in the induction equation. As a result, our methodology can
give rise to new velocity solutions besides the one presented here. To
constrain the induction equation, we use a special case of the minimum
structure approximation that was introduced in previous studies and is already
employed here to resolve the $180^o$-ambiguity in the input vector
magnetograms. We reconstruct the inductive velocity for three active regions,
including NOAA AR 8210 for which previous results exist. Our solution
believably reproduces the horizontal flow patterns in the studied active
regions but breaks down in cases of localized rapid magnetic flux emergence or
submergence. Alternative approximations and constraints are possible and can be
accommodated into our general formalism.

quantitative statistical measures of their structure. We investigate the

different evolutionary classes in the observations and the temporal evolution
in models of gravoturbulent fragmentation, we study the temporal evolution of
the cluster structures. We apply different statistical methods, in particular
the normalised mean correlation length and the minimum spanning tree technique.
We refine the normalisation of the clustering parameters by defining the area
using the normalised convex hull of the objects and investigate the effect of
two-dimensional projection of three-dimensional clusters. We introduce a new
measure $\xi$ for the elongation of a cluster. It is defined as the ratio of
the cluster radius determined by an enclosing circle to the cluster radius
derived from the normalised convex hull. The mean separation of young stars
increases with the evolutionary class, reflecting the expansion of the cluster.
The clustering parameters of the model clusters correspond in many cases well
to those from observed ones, especially when the $\xi$ values are similar. No
correlation of the clustering parameters with the turbulent environment of the
molecular cloud is found, indicating that possible influences of the
environment on the clustering behaviour are quickly smoothed out by the stellar
velocity dispersion. The temporal evolution of the clustering parameters shows
that the star cluster builds up from several subclusters and evolves to a more
centrally concentrated cluster, while the cluster expands slower than new stars
are formed.

image-processing techniques can be used to measure the expected
self-organization of solar magnetic fields. While these techniques advance our
understanding of the physical system at work, it is unclear whether they can be
used to predict solar eruptions, thus obtaining a practical significance for
space weather. We address part of this problem by focusing on solar active
regions and by investigating the usefulness of scaling and multi-scaling
image-processing techniques in solar flare prediction. Since solar flares
exhibit spatial and temporal intermittency, we suggest that they are the
products of instabilities subject to a critical threshold in a turbulent
magnetic configuration. The identification of this threshold in scaling and
multi-scaling spectra would then contribute meaningfully to the prediction of
solar flares. We find that the fractal dimension of solar magnetic fields and
their multi-fractal spectrum of generalized correlation dimensions do not have
significant predictive ability. The respective multi-fractal structure
functions and their inertial-range scaling exponents, however, probably provide
some statistical distinguishing features between flaring and non-flaring active
regions. More importantly, the temporal evolution of the above scaling
exponents in flaring active regions probably shows a distinct behavior starting
a few hours prior to a flare and therefore this temporal behavior may be
practically useful in flare prediction. The results of this study need to be
validated by more comprehensive works over a large number of solar active
regions.

The overlayed maps and the emissivity profiles along the jet show good
correspondence between emission regions at the various wavelengths; a few show
offsets between the knots peaks of <1"". In 1150+497 the X-ray, optical, and
radio profiles decrease in similar ways with distance from the core up to ~7"",
after which the radio emission increases more than the X-ray one. No X-ray
spectral variations are observed in 1150+497. In 1136-135 an interesting
behavior is observed, whereby, downstream of the most prominent knot at ~ 6.5""
from the core, the X-ray emission fades while the radio emission brightens. The
X-ray spectrum also varies, with the X-ray photon index flattening from ~2 in
the inner part to ~1.7 to the end of the jet. We intepret the jet behavior in
1136-135 in a scenario where the relativistic flow suffers systematic
deceleration along the jet, and briefly discuss the major consequences of this

of about 1 billion sources brighter than V=20. Its goal is to provide
astrometry leading to parallaxes, proper-motions and positions. Astrometric
data are complemented by multicolour photometry and a spectroscopic instrument
(up to V=17 mag) to provide astrophysical parameters (as effective
temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities) and radial velocities. The
survey will have multi-epoch observations allowing a detection of the variable
sources; objects will be measured as a mean 80/100 times over the 5 year
mission length in the two instruments on board, the Astro-/Spectro-instruments
respectively.
  The data processing of the mission is a major challenge: as a first step
working groups on different themes were created and have been active. One
working group has been dedicated to variable stars. A consortium for the data
processing is currently being created, the Data Processing and Analysis
Consortium.
  Though several aspects of the Gaia mission are under possible changes, we
review some activities related to the mission in the perspective of pulsating

Morphologically such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate between
old, field early-L dwarfs (log(g)~5) and very late M giants (log(g)~0), leading
us to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signatures
of this L dwarf. Such a low gravity can be explained only if this L dwarf is
much lower in mass than a typical old field L dwarf of similar temperature and
is still contracting to its final radius. These conditions imply a very young
age. Further evidence of youth is found in the near-infrared spectrum,
including a triangular-shaped H-band continuum reminiscent of young brown dwarf
candidates discovered in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using the above information
along with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models, our
current best estimate is that this L dwarf has an age of 1-50 Myr and a mass of
6-25 M_Jupiter. The location of 2MASS 0141-4633 on the sky coupled with a
distance estimate of ~35 pc and the above age estimate suggests that this

we use the maximal Lyapunov exponent computed with the dynamical fast indicator

the planets. We demonstrate that GAMP is especially well suited for the

A strong Fe-line emission at the z(rest)=1.06 confirms its thermal nature. We
find that the CSS radio source is highly overpressured with respect to the
thermal cluster medium by ~2-3 orders of magnitude. This provides direct
observational evidence that the radio source is not thermally confined as
posited in the ``frustrated'' scenario for CSS sources. Instead, the radio
source may be young and at an early stage of its evolution. This source
provides the first detection of the AGN in outburst in the center of a cooling
flow cluster. Powerful radio sources are thought to be triggered by the cooling
flows. The evidence for the AGN activity and intermittent outbursts comes from
the X-ray morphology of low redshift clusters, which usually do not harbour
quasars. 3C186 is a young active radio source which can supply the energy into
the cluster and potentially prevent its cooling. We discuss energetics related

provide the first complete inventory of solid-state material in dense clouds
before star formation begins. The spectra show prominent 6.0 and 6.85 micron
bands. In contrast to some young stellar objects (YSOs), most (~75%) of the 6.0
micron band is explained by the bending mode of pure water ice. In realistic
mixtures this number increases to 85%, because the peak strength of the water
bending mode is very sensitive to the molecular environment. The strength of
the 6.85 micron band is comparable to what is observed toward YSOs. Thus, the
production of the carrier of this band does not depend on the energetic input
of a nearby source. The spectra show large abundances of carbon monoxide and
carbon dioxide (20-40% with respect to water ice). Compared to YSOs, the band
profile of the 15 micron carbon dioxide bending mode lacks the signatures of
crystallization, confirming the cold, pristine nature of these lines of sight.
After the dominant species are removed, there are residuals that suggest the
presence of minor species such as formic acid and possibly ammonia. Clearly,
models of star formation should begin with dust models already coated with a
fairly complex mixture of ices.

core and using a neural network method in the primary mass separation. The
proton spectrum can be expressed by a single power-law function with a

that the main component responsible for the change of the power index of the

g-mode frequencies -- the effect increases with mode order. In the present
study we adopt the classical perturbative approach to estimate the internal
field of a 4 solar mass SPB star by looking at its effect on a low-degree

that a polar field strength of about 110 kG on the edge of the convective core

order have been observed in several SPB variables, in some cases clearly too
small to be ascribed to rotation. We suggest that they may be due to a poloidal

the canonical magnetohydrodynamic approximation thereby freeing the magnetic
field to diffuse with respect to the bulk velocity field. As a consequence,
however, the induction equation can become problematic to solve via standard
explicit techniques. In particular, the Hall diffusion term admits fast-moving
whistler waves which can impose a vanishing timestep limit.
  Within an explicit differencing framework, a multifluid scheme for weakly
ionised plasmas is presented which relies upon a new approach to integrating
the induction equation efficiently. The first component of this approach is a
relatively unknown method of accelerating the integration of parabolic systems
by enforcing stability over large compound timesteps rather than over each of
the constituent substeps. This method, Super Time Stepping, proves to be very
effective in applying a part of the Hall term up to a known critical value. The
excess of the Hall term above this critical value is then included via a new
scheme for pure Hall diffusion.

different stellar populations. The study of the X-ray populations of E and S0
galaxies has revamped the debate on the formation and evolution of low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and on the role of globular clusters in these processes.
While overall stellar mass drives the amount of X-ray binaries in old stellar
populations, the amount of sources in star forming galaxies is related to the
star formation rate. Short-lived, luminous, high-mass binaries (HMXBs) dominate
these young populations. The most luminous sources in these systems are the
debated ULXs, which have been suggested to be ~100-1000 Msol black holes, but
could alternatively include a number of binaries with stellar mass black holes.
Very soft sources have also been discovered in many galaxies and their nature
is currently being debated. Observations of the deep X-ray sky, and comparison
with deep optical surveys, are providing the first evidence of the X-ray
evolution of galaxies.

separates two galactic populations with different astrophysical properties.
More massive systems tend to have their stars formed at z > 2 and show less

by the formation of the structure in a hierarchical scenario. Our results also

transients in the Galaxy which probably reveal a previously unrecognised type
of accretion on to neutron stars or black holes. We show that these systems
cannot have descended from binaries with stellar-mass components of normal
composition. Accretion of hydrogen-depleted matter on to stellar-mass black
holes can account for individual systems, but requires that these transients
should be observed to repeat within a few years, and does not explain why the
class is distinctly faint.
  Two other explanations appear to be quite natural. One invokes accretion by
neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes from companions which were already
brown dwarfs or planets when the systems formed, i.e. which did not descend
from low-mass stars. The other possibility is that these systems are the
endpoints of primordial (zero-metallicity) binaries in which the primary was
extremely massive, and collapsed to a black hole of mass > 1000 solar masses.
The (primordial) companion must by now have reached an extremely low mass (<
0.01 solar mass) and be transferring mass at a very low rate to the black hole.
This picture avoids the main difficulty encountered by models invoking
intermediate-mass black hole formation at non-primordial metallicities, and is
a natural consequence of some current ideas about Population III star
formation.

limited by the intrinsic width of the ion emissivity functions that are used to

an externally applied field using the 2D fluctuating bond model with
single-segment Monte Carlo moves. We concentrate on the influence of the field
strength $E$, length of the chain $N$, and length of the pore $L$ on forced
translocation. As our main result, we find a crossover scaling for the
translocation time $\tau $ with the chain length from $\tau \sim N^{2\nu}$ for
relatively short polymers to $\tau \sim N^{1 + \nu}$ for longer chains, where
$\nu $ is the Flory exponent. We demonstrate that this crossover is due to the
change in the dependence of the translocation velocity v on the chain length.
For relatively short chains $v \sim N^{- \nu}$, which crosses over to $v \sim
N^{- 1}$ for long polymers. The reason for this is that with increasing $N$
there is a high density of segments near the exit of the pore, which slows down
the translocation process due to slow relaxation of the chain. For the case of
a long nanopore for which $R_\parallel $, the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ along
the pore, is smaller than the pore length, we find no clear scaling of the
translocation time with the chain length. For large $N$, however, the
asymptotic scaling $\tau \sim N^{1 + \nu}$ is recovered. In this regime, $\tau
$ is almost independent of $L$. We have previously found that for a polymer,
which is initially placed in the middle of the pore, there is a minimum in the
escape time for $R_\parallel \approx L$. We show here that this minimum
persists for a weak fields $E$ such that $EL$ is less than some critical value,
but vanishes for large values of $EL$.

sizes and coding delay are all reduced by a factor O(n) at a redundancy below
2*log(e)/2^g bits/symbol (for n input symbols and g-bit QI precision). Due to
its tighter enumeration, QI output redundancy is below that of arithmetic
coding (which can be derived as a lower accuracy approximation of QI). The
relative compression gain vanishes in large n and in high entropy limits and
increases for shorter outputs and for less predictable data. QI is
significantly faster than the fastest arithmetic coders, from factor 6 in high
entropy limit to over 100 in low entropy limit (`typically' 10-20 times
faster). These speedups are result of using only 3 adds, 1 shift and 2 array
lookups (all in 32 bit precision) per less probable symbol and no coding
operations for the most probable symbol . Further, the exact enumeration

errors; however, we show that it is vulnerable to different forms of the void
problem and have no viable complementary approach to overcome them.
Specifically, we show that there are instances when packets reach nodes with no

nodes with the same coordinates to arise at different points in the network in
the presence of voids. This paper identifies and analyzes these problems. It
also compares several existing routing protocols based on Virtual Coordinate

increasing momentum transfer Q^2. We present a simple argument how such a
decrease arises naturally in chiral soliton models. For a detailed comparison
of model results with experimentally determined form factors it is necessary to
employ a boost from the soliton rest frame to the Breit frame. To enforce
asymptotic counting rules for form factors, the model must be supplemented by
suitably chosen interpolating powers n in the boost prescription. Within the
minimal pi-rho-omega soliton model, with the same n for both, electric and
magnetic form factors, it is possible to obtain a very satisfactory fit to all
available proton data for the magnetic form factor and to the recent
polarization results for the ratio G_E/G_M. At the same time the small and very
sensitive neutron electric form factor is reasonably well reproduced. The
results show a systematic discrepancy with presently available data for the
neutron magnetic form factor G_M^n for Q^2 > 1 (GeV/c)^2. We additionally
comment on the possibility to extract information about the form factors in the

It is shown that the appearance of an anisotropic condensate breaks Lorentz
symmetry; relativistic symmetry, realized by means of the 3-parameter group of
generalized Lorentz boosts, remains valid here nevertheless. We have obtained
the bispinor representation of the group of generalized Lorentz boosts, which

  http://www.stat.washington.edu/jaw/RESEARCH/PAPERS/available.html",,,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  Weighted likelihood, in which one solves Horvitz-Thompson or inverse
probability weighted (IPW) versions of the likelihood equations, offers a
simple and robust method for fitting models to two phase stratified samples. We
consider semiparametric models for which solution of infinite dimensional
estimating equations leads to $\sqrt{N}$ consistent and asymptotically Gaussian
estimators of both Euclidean and nonparametric parameters. If the phase two
sample is selected via Bernoulli (i.i.d.) sampling with known sampling
probabilities, standard estimating equation theory shows that the influence
function for the weighted likelihood estimator of the Euclidean parameter is
the IPW version of the ordinary influence function. By proving weak convergence
of the IPW empirical process, and borrowing results on weighted bootstrap
empirical processes, we derive a parallel asymptotic expansion for finite
population stratified sampling. Whereas the asymptotic variance for Bernoulli
sampling involves the within strata second moments of the influence function,
for finite population stratified sampling it involves only the within strata
variances. The latter asymptotic variance also arises when the observed
sampling fractions are used as estimates of those known a priori. A general
procedure is proposed for fitting semiparametric models with estimated weights
to two phase data. Several of our key results have already been derived for the
special case of Cox regression with stratified case-cohort studies, other
complex survey designs and missing data problems more generally. This paper is
intended to help place this previous work in appropriate context and to pave
the way for applications to other models.

function V(x) on the one-dimensional torus along an orbit of the shift
x-->x+nw. If the Lyapunov exponent is positive for all energies and w, then the
integrated density of states is absolutely continuous for almost every w. In
this work we establish the formation of a dense set of gaps in the spectrum.
Our approach is based on an induction on scales argument, and is therefore both
constructive as well as quantitative. Resonances between eigenfunctions of one
scale lead to ""pre-gaps"" at a larger scale. To pass to actual gaps in the
spectrum, we show that these pre-gaps cannot be filled more than a finite (and
uniformly bounded) number of times. To accomplish this, we relate a pre-gap to
pairs of complex zeros of the Dirichlet determinants off the unit circle using
the techniques of an earlier paper by the authors. Amongst other things, we
establish in this work a non-perturbative version of the co-variant
parametrization of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions via the phases in the
spirit of Sinai's (perturbative) description of the spectrum via his function
as well as an multi-scale/finite volume approach to Anderson localization in
this context. This allows us to relate the gaps in the spectrum with the graphs
of the eigenvalues parametrized by the phase. Our infinite volume theorems hold
for all Diophantine frequencies w up to a set of Hausdorff dimension zero. This
is in contrast to earlier technology which only yielded exceptional sets of
measure zero. Our only assumption on the potential apart from analyticity is
the positivity of the Lyapunov exponent.

thresholds, the cross-correlation matrix is then transformed into a network
connectivity matrix and analyzed. To study a specific example, we selected data
from an earlier experiment focusing on the MMN brain wave. The resulting
analysis highlights significant differences between the spatial activations
associated with Standard and Deviant tones, with interesting physiological
implications. When compared to random data networks, physiological networks are
more connected, with longer links and shorter path lengths. Furthermore, as
compared to the Deviant case, Standard data networks are more connected, with
longer links and shorter path lengths--i.e., with a stronger ``small worlds''
character. The comparison between both networks shows that areas known to be
activated in the MMN wave are connected. In particular, the analysis supports
the idea that supra-temporal and inferior frontal data work together in the
processing of the differences between sounds by highlighting an increased
connectivity in the response to a novel sound.

behind the generalization is based on mark-recapture observations reported in
Giuggioli et al. [Bull. Math. Biol. 67, 1135 (2005)] that have necessitated the
introduction of home ranges in the simple model of Hantavirus spread presented
by Abramson and Kenkre [Phys. Rev. E 66, 11912 (2002)]. The essential feature
of the model presented here is the existence of adult mice that remain largely
confined to locations near their home ranges, and itinerant juvenile mice that
are not so confined, and, during their search for their own homes, move and
infect both other juveniles and adults that they meet during their movement.
The model is presented at three levels of description: mean field, kinetic and
configuration. Results of calculations are shown explicitly from the mean field
equations and the simulation rules, and are found to agree in some respects and
to differ in others. The origin of the differences is shown to lie in spatial
correlations. It is indicated how mark-recapture observations in the field may

  A candidate for this phase space density is constructed for ground state of
the relativistic hydrogen problem of a spinless particle. The first excited
states and their spherical harmonics are also considered in this framework. The

the Schmidt measure for two-colorable graph states [Phys. Rev. A 69, 062311

the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the associated
graph. We remark that almost all two-colorable graph states have maximal
Schmidt measure and we construct specific examples. These involve perfect
trees, line graphs of trees, cographs, graphs from anti-Hadamard matrices, and
unyciclic graphs. We consider some graph transformations, with the idea of

subgroup problem (HSP). What is more, most exponential speedups in quantum
computation are obtained by solving instances of the HSP. A common feature of
the resulting algorithms is the use of quantum coset states, which encode the
hidden subgroup. An open question has been how hard it is to use these states
to solve graph isomorphism. It was recently shown by Moore, Russell, and
Schulman that only an exponentially small amount of information is available
from one, or a pair of coset states. A potential source of power to exploit are
entangled quantum measurements that act jointly on many states at once. We show
that entangled quantum measurements on at least \Omega(n log n) coset states
are necessary to get useful information for the case of graph isomorphism,
matching an information theoretic upper bound. This may be viewed as a negative
result because highly entangled measurements seem hard to implement in general.
Our main theorem is very general and also rules out using joint measurements on
few coset states for some other groups, such as GL(n, F_{p^m}) and G^n where G
is finite and satisfies a suitable property.
