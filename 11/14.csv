of the 40 radius-exansion bursts in this sample reached peak fluxes which were
normally distributed about a mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standard
deviation of 7.6%. The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak
fluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a consequence,
the overall variation in the peak flux of the radius-expansion bursts was a
factor of ~2. This variation is comparable to the range of the Eddington limit
between material with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation
may arise if, for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the accreted H is
eliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or expelled in a radiatively-driven
wind. However, steady burning cannot exhaust the accreted H for solar
composition material within the typical ~2 hr burst recurrence time, nor can it
result in sufficient elemental stratification to allow selective ejection of
the H only. An additional stratification mechanism appears to be required to
separate the accreted elements and thus allow preferential ejection of the
hydrogen. We found no evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution between
the radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts, previously observed in
smaller samples. Assuming that the faint radius-expansion bursts reached the
Eddington limit for H-rich material (X~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limit
for pure He (X=0), we estimate the distance to 4U 1636-536 (for a canonical
neutron star with M_NS=1.4M_sun, R_NS=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5 kpc, or for

processed material from the interior of the star, and the yield predictions for

this late evolutionary phase. Published uncertainty estimates for each of these
two rates propagated through stellar evolution calculations cause uncertainties
in carbon enrichment and yield predictions of about a factor of two. The other
important He-burning reaction C12(alpha,gamma)O16, although associated with the

sequences of both uniformly and differentially rotating relativistic polytropes
with index N = 1. We identify several modes, including the lowest-order l = 0,
2, and 4 axisymmetric modes, as well as several axisymmetric inertial modes.
Differential rotation significantly lowers mode frequencies, increasing
prospects for detection by current gravitational wave interferometers. We
observe an extended avoided crossing between the l = 0 and l = 4 first
overtones, which is important for correctly identifying mode frequencies in
case of detection. For uniformly rotating stars near the mass-shedding limit,
we confirm the existence of the mass-shedding-induced damping of pulsations,

investigate non-linear harmonics of the linear modes and notice that rotation
changes the pulsation frequencies in a way that would allow for various
parametric instabilities between two or three modes to take place. We assess
the detectability of each obtained mode by current gravitational wave detectors

embedded in an AlGaSb quantum well, are favorable for observing the optical
exciton Aharonov-Bohm effect. The second derivative of the exciton energy with

zero total angular momentum, that are conservative and with kinetic terms that

particle models and then interpret these from a relational perspective. By
these means, previous suggestions of bad semiclassicality for such models can
be eluded. I show how small (particle number) universe relational particle

counterbalanced total angular momentum. These features mean that these small

  Modern Physics","Stud.Hist.Philos.Mod.Phys.38:15,2007",,,"gr-qc",,"  The conventional spacetime formulation of general relativity may be recast as
a dynamics of spatial 3-geometries (geometrodynamics). Furthermore,
geometrodynamics can be derived from first principles. I investigate two
distinct sets of these: (i) Hojman, Kucha\v{r} and Teitelboim's, which
presuppose that the spatial 3-geometries are embedded in spacetime. (ii) The
3-space approach of Barbour, Foster, \'{O} Murchadha and Anderson in which the
spatial 3-geometries are presupposed but spacetime is not. I consider how the
constituent postulates of the conventional approach to relativity emerge or are
to be built into these formulations. I argue that the 3-space approach is a
viable description of classical physics (fundamental matter fields included),
and one which affords considerable philosophical insight because of its
`relationalist' character. From these assumptions of less structure, it is also
interesting that conventional relativity can be recovered (albeit as one of
several options).
  However, contrary to speculation in the earlier 3-space approach papers, I
also argue that this approach is not selective over which sorts of fundamental
matter physics it admits. In particular, it does not imply the equivalence
principle.

general iteration solution for the full gluon propagator can be exactly and
uniquely decomposed as a sum of the two pricipally different terms. The first

than $1/q^2$) infrared singularities accompanied by the corresponding powers of
the mass gap and multiplied by the corresponding residues. The second

hidden in the above-mentioned skeleton loop integrals due to the nonlinear

in order to make a gauge-invariant existence of the mass gap perfectly clear.
Moreover, it survives an infinite series summation of the relevant skeleton
loop contributions into the gluon self-energy. The physical meaning of the mass

used to make the most precise determination to date of the strange-, up-, and
down-quark masses, $m_s$, $m_u$, and $m_d$, respectively. Perturbative matching
is required in order to connect the lattice-regularized bare- quark masses to
the masses as defined in the \msbar scheme, and this is done here for the first
time at next-to-next-to leading (or two-loop) order. The bare-quark masses
required as input come from simulations by the MILC collaboration of a
highly-efficient formalism (using so-called ``staggered'' quarks), with three
flavors of light quarks in the Dirac sea; these simulations were previously
analyzed in a joint study by the HPQCD and MILC collaborations, using
degenerate $u$ and $d$ quarks, with masses as low as $m_s/8$, and two values of
the lattice spacing, with chiral extrapolation/interpolation to the physical
masses. With the new perturbation theory presented here, the resulting \msbar\
masses are $m^\msbar_s(2 {GeV}) = 87(0)(4)(4)(0)$ MeV, and $\hat m^\msbar(2
{GeV}) = 3.2(0)(2)(2)(0)$ MeV, where $\hat m = \sfrac12 (m_u + m_d)$ is the
average of the $u$ and $d$ masses. The respective uncertainties are from
statistics, simulation systematics, perturbation theory, and
electromagnetic/isospin effects. The perturbative errors are about a factor of
two smaller than in an earlier study using only one-loop perturbation theory.
Using a recent determination of the ratio $m_u/m_d = 0.43(0)(1)(0)(8)$ due to
the MILC collaboration, these results also imply $m^\msbar_u(2 {GeV}) =
1.9(0)(1)(1)(2)$ MeV and $m^\msbar_d(2 {GeV}) = 4.4(0)(2)(2)(2)$ MeV. A
technique for estimating the next order in the perturbative expansion is also
presented, which uses input from simulations at more than one lattice spacing.

candidates for the messenger of SUSY breaking at low energy scales. In a
scenario that moduli-mediated SUSY breaking is significant, the pattern of soft
SUSY breaking terms depends crucially on how the light moduli with mass m
\lesssim O(8\pi^2 m_{3/2}) are stabilized. We discuss the correspondence
between the pattern of soft terms and the stabilization mechanism of light
moduli within the framework of 4D effective supergravity which is generalized
to include a SUSY-breaking uplifting potential which might be necessary to get
the phenomenologically viable de-Sitter (or Minkowski) vacuum. In some special
case, light moduli can be stabilized by controllably small perturbative
corrections to the K\""ahler potential, yielding the soft terms dominated by the
moduli-mediated contribution. In more generic situation, light moduli are
stabilized by non-perturbative effects encoded in the superpotential and a
quite different pattern of soft terms emerges: the anomaly-mediated soft terms
become comparable to the moduli-mediated ones. Such mixed moduli-anomaly
mediated soft terms lead to low energy superparticle masses qualitatively
different from those of other mediation models such as mSUGRA scenario,
gauge-mediation, and anomaly-mediation.

as an example of the geometric phase. Though there is some superficial
similarity between these two notions, we here show that the differences bewteen
these two notions are more profound and fundamental. As an explicit example, we
analyze in detail a quantum mechanical model proposed by M. Stone, which is
supposed to show the above connection. We show that the geometric term in the
model, which is topologically trivial for any finite time interval $T$,
corresponds to the so-called ``normal naive term'' in field theory and has
nothing to do with the anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino term. In the fundamental
level, the difference between the two notions is stated as follows: The
topology of gauge fields leads to level crossing in the fermionic sector in the

the biHermitian geometry of Gates, Hull and Roceck, the most general sigma
model target space geometry allowing for (2,2) world sheet supersymmetry. We
present a sigma model for biKaehler geometry that is topological in the
following sense: i) the action is invariant under a fermionic symmetry delta;
ii) delta is nilpotent on shell; iii) the action is delta--exact on shell up to
a topological term; iv) the resulting field theory depends only on a subset of
the target space geometrical data. The biKaehler sigma model is obtainable by
gauge fixing the Hitchin model with generalized Kaehler target space. It
further contains the customary A topological sigma model as a particular case.
However, it is not seemingly related to the (2,2) supersymmetric biKaehler
sigma model by twisting in general.

algebras to a C*-algebra constructed from the characteristic variety and the
hermitian line bundle associated to the central quadratic form. We apply the
general theory in the case of noncommutative 3-spheres and show that the above
morphism corresponds to a natural ramified covering by a noncommutative
3-dimensional nilmanifold. We then compute the Jacobian of the ramified
covering and obtain the answer as the product of a period (of an elliptic
integral) by a rational function. We describe the real and complex moduli
spaces of noncommutative 3-spheres, relate the real one to root systems and the
complex one to the orbits of a birational cubic automorphism of three
dimensional projective space. We classify the algebras and establish duality

the measured momentum correlations, have been fully discussed since 1950's. The
analogous momentum correlations between identical fermions are however less
argued. Besides the fermion statistics, the momentum correlations between
identical fermions are also determined by some other aspects, such as coulomb
interaction, spin interactions and resonances formation. In this paper, we
discussed the factors that influence the momentum correlations between
$\Lambda$'s, especially spin interaction. It is also argued that the momentum
correlations between $\Lambda$'s are affected significantly by the yield ratio
of $\Sigma^0/\Lambda$, due to the limitation of experimental measurement. The
mixture of $\Sigma^0$'s and $\Lambda$s would significantly weaken the measured
two-particle momentum correlations of $\Lambda$'s.
