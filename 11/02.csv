cosmological simulations of structure and galaxy formation. We combine high
resolution N-body simulations of the evolution of the dark matter with a
semi-analytic model for the formation and evolution of galaxies which includes
detailed prescriptions for the long-term evolution of galactic winds. This
model is the first to describe the evolution of outflows as a two-phase process
(an adiabatic bubble followed by a momentum--driven shell) and to include
metal--dependent cooling of the outflowing material. We find that the main
statistical properties of the Lyalpha forest, namely the flux power spectrum
P(k) and the flux probability distribution function (PDF), are not
significantly affected by winds and so do not significantly constrain wind
models. Winds around galaxies do, however, produce detectable signatures in the
forest, in particular, increased flux transmissivity inside hot bubbles, and
narrow, saturated absorption lines caused by dense cooled shells. We find that
the Lyalpha flux transmissivity is highly enhanced near strongly wind-blowing
galaxies, almost half of all high-redshift galaxies in our sample, in agreement
with the results of Adelberger et al. (2005). Finally, we propose a new method
to identify absorption lines potentially due to wind shells in the Lyalpha
forest: we calculate the abundance of saturated regions in spectra as a
function of region width and we find that the number with widths smaller than
about 1 Angstrom at z=3 and 0.6 Angstrom at z=2 may be more than doubled. This
should be detectable in real spectra.

al. (2004), we have a sample of eleven DLA galaxies with uniquely comprehensive
and homogeneous abundance measurements. These observations allow one to study
the abundance patterns of 22 elements and the chemical variations in the
interstellar medium of galaxies outside the Local Group. Comparing the
gas-phase abundance ratios of these high redshift galaxies, we found that they
show low RMS dispersions, reaching only up 2-3 times the statistical errors for
the majority of elements. This uniformity is remarkable given that the quasar
sightlines cross gaseous regions with HI column densities spanning over one
order of magnitude and metallicities ranging from 1/55 to 1/5 solar. The
gas-phase abundance patterns of interstellar medium clouds within the DLA
galaxies detected along the velocity profiles show, on the other hand, a high
dispersion in several abundance ratios, indicating that chemical variations
seem to be more confined to individual clouds within the DLA galaxies than to
integrated profiles. The analysis of the cloud-to-cloud chemical variations
within seven individual DLAs reveals that five of them show statistically
significant variations, higher than 0.2 dex at more than 3 sigma. The sources
of these variations are both the differential dust depletion and/or ionization
effects; however, no evidence for variations due to different star formation
histories could be highlighted. These observations place large constraints on
the mixing timescales of protogalaxies and on scenarios of galaxy formation
within the CDM hierarchical theory. Finally, we provide an astrophysical
determination of the oscillator strength of the NiII 1317 transition.

merger remnant NGC 7252 and has a velocity dispersion and effective radius of
sigma=27.5+-2.5 km/s and R_eff=9.3+-1.7 pc, respectively. The other cluster,
G114, located in the ~3 Gyr old merger remnant NGC 1316, is much more compact,
R_eff=4.08+-0.55 pc, and has a velocity dispersion of sigma=42.1+-2.8 km/s.
These measurements allow an estimate of the virial mass of the two clusters,
yielding M_dyn(W30)=1.59(+-0.26) * 10^7 Msun and M_dyn(G114)=1.64(+-0.13) *10^7
Msun. Both clusters are extremely massive, being more than three times heavier
than the most massive globular clusters in the Galaxy. For both clusters we
measure light-to-mass ratios, which when compared to simple stellar population
(SSP) models of the appropriate age, are consistent with a Kroupa-type stellar
mass function. Using measurements from the literature we find a strong age
dependence on how well SSP models (with underlying Kroupa or Salpeter-type
stellar mass functions) fit the light-to-mass ratio of clusters. Based on this
result we suggest that the large scatter in the light-to-mass ratio of the
youngest clusters is not due to variations in the underlying stellar mass
function, but instead to the rapidly changing internal dynamics of young
clusters. Finally, based on the positions of old globular clusters, young
massive clusters (YMCs), ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf-globular
transition objects (DGTOs) in kappa-space we conclude that 1) UCDs and DGTOs
are consistent with the high mass end of star clusters and 2) YMCs occupy a
much larger parameter space than old globular clusters, consistent with the
idea of preferential disruption of star clusters. (abridged)

simultaneous AGN and starburst activity, as well as galaxy-wide superwinds. I
show that there is probably a close connection between these phenomena by
extending an earlier treatment of the M_BH - sigma relation (King, 2003). As
the black hole grows, an outflow drives a shell into the surrounding gas. This
stalls after a dynamical time at a size determined by the hole's current mass
and thereafter grows on the Salpeter timescale. The gas trapped inside this
bubble cools and forms stars and is recycled as accretion and outflow. The
consequent high metallicity agrees with that commonly observed in AGN
accretion. Once the hole reaches a critical mass this region attains a size
such that the gas can no longer cool efficiently. The resulting energy-driven
flow expels the remaining gas as a superwind, fixing both the M_BH - sigma
relation and the total stellar bulge mass at values in good agreement with
observation. Black hole growth thus produces starbursts and ultimately a
superwind.

of the first IFUs to be used in a space mission. To give the MIRI community a
preview of the properties of the MIRI-MRS data products before the telescope is
operational, the Specsim tool has been developed to model, in software, the
operation of the spectrometer. Specsim generates synthetic data frames
approximating those which will be taken by the instrument in orbit. The program
models astronomical sources and transforms them into detector frames using the
predicted optical properties of the telescope and MIRI. These frames can then
be used to illustrate and inform a range of operational activities, including
data calibration strategies and the development and testing of the data
reduction software for the MIRI-MRS. Specsim will serve as a means of

illustrate the performance of the spectrometer under different circumstances,

steady state spiral density waves moving at different patterns speeds. Our
investigation is based on direct numerical integration of initially circular
test-particle orbits. We examine a range of spiral strengths and spiral speeds
and show that stars in this time dependent gravitational field can be heated
(their random motions increased).This is particularly noticeable in the
simultaneous propagation of a 2-armed spiral density wave near the corotation
resonance (CR), and a weak 4-armed one near the inner and outer 4:1 Lindblad
resonances. In simulations with 2 spiral waves moving at different pattern
speeds we find: (1) the variance of the radial velocity, sigma_R^2, exceeds the
sum of the variances measured from simulations with each individual pattern;
(2) sigma_R^2 can grow with time throughout the entire simulation; (3)
sigma_R^2 is increased over a wider range of radii compared to that seen with
one spiral pattern; (4) particles diffuse radially in real space whereas they
don't when only one spiral density wave is present. Near the CR with the
stronger, 2-armed pattern, test particles are observed to migrate radially.
These effects take place at or near resonances of both spirals so we interpret
them as the result of stochastic motions. This provides a possible new
mechanism for increasing the stellar velocity dispersion in galactic disks. If
multiple spiral patterns are present in the Galaxy we predict that there should
be large variations in the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of radius.

triaxiality on the microlensing optical depth to the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). The optical depth can be used to ascertain the number of Massive Compact
Halo Objects (MACHOs); a larger spheroid contribution would imply fewer Halo
MACHOs. On the one hand, the triaxiality gives rise to more spheroid mass along
the line of sight between us and the LMC and thus a larger optical depth.
However, shifting the spheroid center leads to an effect that goes in the other
direction: the best fit to the spheroid center is_away_ from the line of sight

change in optical depth due to the Newberg/Yanny triaxial halo is at most 50%.

MACHO contribution (central value) to the mass of the Galactic Halo varies from
\~(8-20)% if all excess lensing events observed by the MACHO collaboration are

galaxies formed through mergers. Using hundreds of simulations to judge the
impact of progenitor galaxy properties on merger remnants, we find that gas
dissipation provides an important contribution to tilt in the Fundamental Plane
relation. Dissipationless mergers of disks produce remnants that occupy the
virial plane. As the gas content of disk galaxies is increased, the tilt of the
Fundamental Plane relation increases and the slope of the Re-M_* relation
steepens. For gas fractions fgas > 30%, the simulated Fundamental Plane
scalings approach those observed in the K-band. In our simulations, feedback
from supermassive black hole growth has only a minor influence on the
stellar-mass scaling relations of spheroidal galaxies, but may play a role in
maintaining the observed Fundamental Plane tilt at optical wavelengths by
suppressing residual star formation in merger remnants.
  We estimate that \approx 40-100% of the Fundamental Plane tilt induced by
structural properties owes to trends in the central total-to-stellar mass ratio
M_total/M_* produced by dissipation. Lower mass systems obtain greater phase-
space densities than higher mass systems, producing a galaxy mass-dependent
central M_total/M_* and a corresponding tilt in the Fundamental Plane.

anisotropies and the large scale structure (LSS) traced by the galaxy

correlation results from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in CMB
anisotropies generated at late times due to the dark energy component of the
Universe. In a reionized universe, the ISW quadrupole rescatters and
contributes to the large-scale polarization signal. Thus, in principle, the
large-scale polarization bump in the E-mode should also be correlated with the
galaxy distribution. Unlike CMB temperature-LSS correlation that peaks for
tracers at low redshifts this correlation peaks mostly at redshifts between 1
and 3. Under certain conditions, mostly involving a low optical depth to
reionization, if the Universe reionized at a redshift around 6, the cross
polarization-source signal is marginally detectable, though challenging as it
requires all-sky maps of the large scale structure at redshifts between 1 and
3. If the Universe reionized at a redshift higher than 10, it is unlikely that
this correlation will be detectable even with no instrumental noise all-sky
maps. While our estimates do not guarantee a detection unknown physics related

Saturn's F ring. Departures of their orbits from freely precessing ellipses
result from mutual interactions via their 121:118 mean motion resonance.
Motions are chaotic because the resonance is split into four overlapping
components. Orbital longitudes were observed to drift away from Voyager
predictions, and a sudden jump in mean motions took place close to the time at
which the orbits' apses were antialigned in 2000. Numerical integrations
reproduce both the longitude drifts and the jumps. The latter have been
attributed to the greater strength of interactions near apse antialignment
(every 6.2 years), and it has been assumed that this drift-jump behavior will
continue indefinitely. We re-examine the dynamics by analogy with that of a
nearly adiabatic, parametric pendulum. In terms of this analogy, the current
value of the action of the satellite system is close to its maximum in the
chaotic zone. Consequently, at present, the two separatrix crossings per
precessional cycle occur close to apse antialignment. In this state libration
only occurs when the potential's amplitude is nearly maximal, and the 'jumps'
in mean motion arise during the short intervals of libration that separate long
stretches of circulation. Because chaotic systems explore the entire region of
phase space available to them, we expect that at other times the system would
be found in states of medium or low action. In a low action state it would
spend most of the time in libration, and separatrix crossings would occur near
apse alignment. We predict that transitions between these different states can
happen in as little as a decade. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that
sudden changes in the orbits only happen near apse antialignment.

therefore possible to use simple analytic estimators, based on the relative

ionization rate.
  This paper uses a simple model to investigate the accuracy of two well-known
estimators in dynamically evolving molecular clouds. It is found that, although
the analytical formulae based on the abundances of H3+,H2,CO,O,H2O and HCO+
give a reasonably accurate measure of the cosmic ray ionization rate in static,
quiescent clouds, significant discrepancies occur in rapidly evolving
(collapsing) clouds. As recent evidence suggests that molecular clouds may
consist of complex, dynamically evolving sub-structure, we conclude that simple

The underlying population is found to be much more important for objects
without the [OIII]l 4363 line, and the effective temperature of the ionizing
star clusters of galaxies not showing the auroral line is probably lower. We
also study the subsample of HII galaxies whose properties most closely resemble
the properties of the intermediate-redshift population of Luminous Compact Blue

objects not showing the [OIII]l 4363 line. It might therefore be expected that
the intermediate-redshift population of LCBGs is powered by very massive, yet
somewhat aged star clusters. The oxygen abundance of LCBGs would be greater

158 is known to exhibit intensity dips on a ~2.78 hr period. This is due to
obscuration of the X-ray source on the orbital period by material on the outer
edge of the accretion disc. However, the depth of dipping varied from <10% to
\~83% in three archival XMM-Newton observations of Bo 158. Previous work
suggested that the dip depth was anticorrelated with the X-ray luminosity.
However, we present results from three new XMM-Newton observations that suggest
that the evolution of dipping is instead due to precession of the accretion
disc. Such precession is expected in neutron star LMXBs with mass ratios <0.3
(i.e. with orbital periods <4 hr), such as the Galactic dipping LMXB 4U
1916-053. We simulated the accretion disc of Bo 158 using cutting-edge 3D
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and using the observed parameters. Our
results show disc variability on two time-scales. The disc precesses in a
prograde direction on a period of 81+/-3 hr. Also, a radiatively-driven disc
warp is present in the inner disc, which undergoes retrograde precesson on a
\~31 hr period. From the system geometry, we conclude that the dipping
evolution is driven by the disc precession. Hence we predict that the dipping
behaviour repeats on a ~81 hr cycle.

that can be generated in the core of differentially-rotating neutron stars

be detected with Advanced LIGO-class detectors up to the distance of the Virgo

  model",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The classical drift diffusion (DD) model of spin transport treats spin
relaxation via an empirical parameter known as the ``spin diffusion length''.
According to this model, the ensemble averaged spin of electrons drifting and
diffusing in a solid decays exponentially with distance due to spin dephasing
interactions. The characteristic length scale associated with this decay is the
spin diffusion length. The DD model also predicts that this length is different
for ``upstream'' electrons traveling in a decelerating electric field than for
``downstream'' electrons traveling in an accelerating field. However this
picture ignores energy quantization in confined systems (e.g. quantum wires)
and therefore fails to capture the non-trivial influence of subband structure
on spin relaxation. Here we highlight this influence by simulating upstream
spin transport in a multi-subband quantum wire, in the presence of
D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation, using a semi-classical model that accounts
for the subband structure rigorously. We find that upstream spin transport has
a complex dynamics that defies the simplistic definition of a ``spin diffusion
length''. In fact, spin does not decay exponentially or even monotonically with
distance, and the drift diffusion picture fails to explain the qualitative
behavior, let alone predict quantitative features accurately. Unrelated to spin
transport, we also find that upstream electrons undergo a ``population
inversion'' as a consequence of the energy dependence of the density of states
in a quasi one-dimensional structure.

This theory leads to an intuitive understanding of the system's dynamics as it
demonstrates the analogy between standard random Boolean networks and networks
with canalyzing functions only. It reproduces correctly the scaling of the
number of nonfrozen nodes with system size. We then investigate numerically
attractor lengths and numbers, and explain the findings in terms of the
properties of relevant components. In particular we show that canalyzing
networks can contain very long attractors, albeit they occur less often than in
standard networks.

Yukawa sector. There is however a rather strong disagreement on what the
minimal consistent SO(10) theory is, i.e. what the Higgs sector is. The issue
is particularly sensitive in the context of low-energy supersymmetry.

Nucleosynthesis has been a pillar of the standard model of Cosmology. Because
many of the relevant reaction rates are sensitive to the values of fundamental
constants, such as the fine structure constant and the strong coupling
constant, BBN is a useful tool to probe and to put constraints on possible
cosmological variations of these constants, which arise naturally from many
versions of extra-dimensional theories. In this paper, we study the dependences
of fundamental constants on the radion field of the universal extra dimension
model, and calculate the effects of such varying constants on BBN. We show that
the discrepancy between BBN and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data
on the baryon-to-photon ratio may be reduced if the volume of the extra
dimensions was slightly larger - by $\mathcal{O} (10^{-3})$ - at the BBN era
compared to its present value, which would result in smaller gauge couplings at
BBN by the same factor.

energy-momentum spectrum of the Bose gas and its physical significance. We
review various rigorous and heuristic results as well as open conjectures about
its properties. Our main aim is to convince the readers, including those with
mainly mathematical background, that this subject has many interesting problems
for rigorous research.
  In particular, we investigate the upper bound on the infimum of the energy
for a fixed total momentum $\kk$ given by the expectation value of one-particle
excitations over a squeezed states. This bound can be viewed as a rigorous
version of the famous Bogoliubov method. We show that this approach seems to
lead to a (non-physical) energy gap.
  The variational problem involving squeezed states can serve as the
preparatory step in a perturbative approach that should be useful in computing
excitation spectrum. This version of a perturbative approach to the Bose gas
seems (at least in principle) superior to the commonly used approach based on
the $c$-number substitution.

systems display $1/f$ noise (pink noise) in the power spectrum $S(f)$ of the
$\delta_n$ statistic, whereas integrable ones exibit $1/f^2$ noise (brown
noise). These results have been explained on the basis of the random matrix
theory and periodic orbit theory. Recently we have analyzed the order to chaos
transition in terms of the power spectrum $S(f)$ by using the Robnik billiard

and implies the emergence of green waves. In this connection, we will discuss
adaptive strategies of traffic light control which can considerably improve
throughputs and travel times, using self-organization principles based on local
interactions between vehicles and traffic lights. Similar adaptive control
principles can be applied to other queueing networks such as production
systems. In fact, we suggest to turn push operation of traffic systems into
pull operation: By removing vehicles as fast as possible from the network,
queuing effects can be most efficiently avoided. The proposed control concept
can utilize the cheap sensor technologies available in the future and leads to
reasonable operation modes. It is flexible, adaptive, robust, and decentralized

significantly impact forest ecosystems. The present study makes an assessment
of the impact of projected climate change on forest ecosystems in India. This
assessment is based on climate projections of Regional Climate Model of the
Hadley Centre (HadRM3) using the A2 (740 ppm CO2) and B2 (575 ppm CO2)
scenarios of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios and the BIOME4 vegetation
response model. The main conclusion is that under the climate projection for
the year 2085, 77% and 68% of the forested grids in India are likely to
experience shift in forest types under A2 and B2 scenario, respectively.
Indications are a shift towards wetter forest types in the northeastern region
and drier forest types in the northwestern region in the absence of human
influence. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate warming could
also result in a doubling of net primary productivity under the A2 scenario and
nearly 70% increase under the B2 scenario. The trends of impacts could be
considered as robust but the magnitudes should be viewed with caution, due to
the uncertainty in climate projections. Given the projected trends of likely
impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems, it is important to incorporate
climate change consideration in forest sector long-term planning process.

shows apparently conflicting results. Species' lifetime is reported to be
exponentially distributed, whereas higher order taxa, such as families or
genera, follow a broader distribution, compatible with power law decay. We show
that both these evidences are consistent with a simple evolutionary model that
does not require specific assumptions on species interaction. The model
provides a zero-order description of the dynamics of ecological communities and
its species lifetime distribution can be computed exactly. Different behaviors
are found: an initial $t^{-3/2}$ power law, emerging from a random walk type of
dynamics, which crosses over to a steeper $t^{-2}$ branching process-like
regime and finally is cutoff by an exponential decay which becomes weaker and
weaker as the total population increases. Sampling effects can also be taken
into account and shown to be relevant: if species in the fossil record were
sampled according to the Fisher log-series distribution, lifetime should be
distributed according to a $t^{-1}$ power law. Such variability of behaviors in
a simple model, combined with the scarcity of data available, cast serious
doubts on the possibility to validate theories of evolution on the basis of
species lifetime data.

space. Using (v,k,1)-difference sets, we obtain k^2-k+1 equiangular lines in
C^k when k-1 is a prime power. Using semiregular relative difference sets with
parameters (k,n,k,l) we construct sets of n+1 mutually unbiased bases in C^k.
We show how to construct these difference sets from commutative semifields and
that several known maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases can be obtained in
this way, resolving a conjecture about the monomiality of maximal sets. We also
relate mutually unbiased bases to spin models.

relation on symplectic eigenvalues, which is also of independent interest,
plays a central role in the proof.

enable a positive phase-space representation of correlated Fermi states. The
Gaussian basis extends existing bosonic phase-space methods to Fermi systems
and thus enables first-principles dynamical or equilibrium calculations in
quantum many-body Fermi systems. We prove the completeness and positivity of
the basis, and derive differential forms for products with one- and two-body
operators. Because the basis satisfies fermionic superselection rules, the
resulting phase space involves only c-numbers, without requiring anti-commuting
Grassmann variables.

as a basic assumption. Most people in the field consider the inconsistency
between local realistic theories and quantum mechanics to be a result of
non-local nature of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we derive Bell's
inequality for particles with instantaneous interactions, and show that the
aforementioned contradiction still exists between quantum mechanics and
non-local hidden variable models. Then, we use this non-locality to obtain the
GHZ theorem. In what follows, we show that Bacon and Toner's protocol, for the
simulation of Bell correlation, by using local hidden variables augmented by
classical communication, have some inconsistency with quantum mechanics. Our
approach can answer to Brassard questions from another viewpoint, we show that
if we accept that our nature obeys quantum mechanical laws, then all of quantum
mechanic results cannot be simulated by realistic theories augmented by
classical communication or a single instance use of non-local box.

  honoring Bruce Shore",,"10.1016/j.optcom.2005.11.071",,"quant-ph",,"  All beams of electromagnetic radiation are made of photons. Therefore, it is
important to find a precise relationship between the classical properties of
the beam and the quantum characteristics of the photons that make a particular
beam. It is shown that this relationship is best expressed in terms of the
Riemann-Silberstein vector -- a complex combination of the electric and
magnetic field vectors -- that plays the role of the photon wave function. The
Whittaker representation of this vector in terms of a single complex function
satisfying the wave equation greatly simplifies the analysis. Bessel beams,
exact Laguerre-Gauss beams, and other related beams of electromagnetic
radiation can be described in a unified fashion. The appropriate photon quantum
numbers for these beams are identified. Special emphasis is put on the angular
momentum of a single photon and its connection with the angular momentum of the
beam.
