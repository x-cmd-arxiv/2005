occurred before or during inflation, then the axion dark matter density will
vary from place to place with a probability distribution. By calculating the
net dark matter halo formation rate as a function of all four relevant
cosmological parameters and assessing other constraints, we find that this
probability distribution, computed at stable solar systems, is arguably peaked
near the observed dark matter density. If cosmologically relevant WIMP dark

$\sim1.2\times10^{60}$ ergs. The work done on the gas by the inflation of the
lobes is $\sim3\times10^{59}$ ergs, or $\sim$0.87 keV per particle out to the
radius of the lobes. The radiative timescale for gas at the center of the
cluster at the current temperature is a few Gyrs. The gas in the core was
probably cooler and denser before the outburst, so the cooling time was
considerably shorter. We are therefore likely to be witnessing the quenching of
a cluster cooling flow by a radio galaxy outburst. The mechanical power of the
lobes is at least 20 times larger than the radiative losses out to the cooling
radius. Outbursts of similar power with a $\sim$5% duty cycle would be more
than sufficient to continually reheat the cluster core over the Hubble time and
prevent the cooling of any significant amount of gas. The mechanical power of
the outburst is also roughly two orders of magnitude larger than either the
X-ray luminosity of the active nucleus or the radio luminosity of the lobes.
The equipartition pressure of the radio lobes is more than an order of
magnitude lower than that of the ambient medium, indicating that the pressure
of the lobe is dominated by something other than the relativistic electrons
radiating at GHz frequencies.

losing component in a binary in which mass transfer occurs on the nuclear

the pulsar down to millisecond periods, the subsequent mass transfer phase may
be altered by the presence of the energetic pulsar. In fact, the onset of a

astrophysical plasmas, including accretion disks, the solar wind, and the
interstellar and intracluster medium. On small scales, this turbulence is often
expected to consist of highly anisotropic fluctuations with frequencies small
compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. For a number of applications, the
small scales are also collisionless, so a kinetic treatment of the turbulence
is necessary. We show that this anisotropic turbulence is well described by a
low frequency expansion of the kinetic theory called gyrokinetics. This paper
is the first in a series to examine turbulent astrophysical plasmas in the
gyrokinetic limit. We derive and explain the nonlinear gyrokinetic equations
and explore the linear properties of gyrokinetics as a prelude to nonlinear

its solutions are compared to those of hot-plasma kinetic theory. These results

exhibit very different spectral characteristics, which depend critically on
thermal annealing and can be used to distinguish between mixed, layered and
thermally annealed CO-CO2 ices. CO only affects the CO2 bending mode spectra in
mixed ices below 50K under the current experimental conditions, where it
exhibits a single asymmetric band profile in intimate mixtures. In all other
ice morphologies the CO2 bending mode shows a double peaked profile, similar to
that observed for pure solid CO2. Conversely, CO2 induces a blue-shift in the
peak-position of the CO stretching vibration, to a maximum of 2142 cm-1 in
mixed ices, and 2140-2146 cm-1 in layered ices. As such, the CO2 bending mode
puts clear constraints on the ice morphology below 50K, whereas beyond this
temperature the CO2 stretching vibration can distinguish between initially
mixed and layered ices. This is illustrated for the low-mass YSO HH46, where
the laboratory spectra are used to analyse the observed CO and CO2 band

indicate a non-spherically symmetric circumstellar environment, and a
quantitative analysis of numerous forbidden lines, e.g. [OI], [OII], [NII] and

structure seen almost perfectly edge-on, and an intermediate region of moderate
ionization. The slits of our observations cover the same innermost region of
Hen 2-90 as the HST image, which allows us to combine the observations. Our
spectra contain a huge amount of permitted and forbidden emission lines of

velocity information of the emitting region. We find correlation between the
different ionization states of the elements and the velocities derived from the

while the neutral lines have the lowest. When combining the velocity
information with the HST image of Hen 2-90, it seems that a non-spherical

between the observed and predicted near-IR brightness fluctuations depends on

similar reshifts we find no measurable difference in rest-frame $B$-band

redder in rest-frame $B-V$ (by $0.06\pm0.04 $mag) than the field galaxies in

star-forming cluster spirals are similar to their field counterparts in their

cluster environment has the overall effect of switching off star formation in

elucidating details of this topic by studying, via large-scale atomistic

model is presented for lines of polymer liquid (droplets) on substrates
consisting of alternating strips of wetting (equilibrium contact angle
approximately 0 degrees) and non-wetting (equilibrium contact angle
approximately 90 degrees) material. Droplet spreading is compared for different
wavelength of the pattern and strength of surface interaction on the wetting

non-wetting regions of the substrate to attain a finite contact angle less than
90 degrees. In this case, the extent of spreading depends on the interaction
strength in the wetting regions. A transition is observed such that, for large
wavelength, the droplet spreads only on the wetting region of the substrate by
pulling material from non-wetting regions. In most cases, a precursor film
spreads on the wetting portion of the substrate at a rate strongly dependent

state yielding dynamics of a well established simple glass. In contrast to the
supercooled state, where the shear stress, $\sigma$, tends to zero at vanishing

about two decades in shear rate. This strongly suggests the existence of a
finite dynamic yield stress in the glass, $\sigma^+ (T) \equiv \sigma(T;
\gammadot \to 0) >0$. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of $\sigma^+$
suggests a yield stress discontinuity at the glass transition in agreement with
recent theoretical predictions. We scrutinize and support this observation by
testing explicitly for the assumptions (affine flow, absence of flow induced
ordering) inherent in the theory. Also, a qualitative change of the flow curves
enables us to bracket the glass transition temperature $T_c$ of the theory from
above and (for the first time in simulations) {\it from below}. Furthermore,
the structural relaxation time in the steady state behaves quite similar to the

theory (SFT) is discussed for fermionic lattice models with local interactions.
In the context of the SFT, an approximation is essentially given by specifying
a reference system with the same interaction but a modified non-interacting
part of the Hamiltonian which leads to a partial decoupling of degrees of
freedom. The reference system defines a space of trial self-energies on which
an optimization of the grand potential as a functional of the self-energy
Omega[Sigma] is performed. As a stationary point is not a minimum in general
and does not provide a bound for the exact grand potential, however, it is {\em
a priori} unclear how to judge on the relative quality of two different
approximations. By analyzing the Euler equation of the SFT variational
principle, it is shown that a stationary point of the functional on a subspace
given by a reference system composed of decoupled subsystems is also a
stationary point in case of the coupled reference system. On this basis a
strategy is suggested which generates a sequence of systematically improving
approximations. The discussion is actually relevant for any variational
approach that is not based on wave functions and the Rayleigh-Ritz principle.

obtained from the granular hydrodynamic equations, we recover results which

considered two models of homogeneously thermostated gases: in this framework it
is possible to reveal the presence of non-trivial effects due to velocity
correlations between particles. Such correlations stem from the inelasticity of

a Gaussian in the large system limit, suggests that they are also due to the

D73 (2006) 084011","10.1103/PhysRevD.73.084011",,"gr-qc",,"  During the last few years progress has been made on several fronts making it
possible to revisit Cauchy-perturbative matching (CPM) in numerical relativity
in a more robust and accurate way. This paper is the first in a series where we
plan to analyze CPM in the light of these new results.
  Here we start by testing high-order summation-by-parts operators, penalty
boundaries and contraint-preserving boundary conditions applied to CPM in a
setting that is simple enough to study all the ingredients in great detail:
Einstein's equations in spherical symmetry, describing a black hole coupled to
a massless scalar field. We show that with the techniques described above, the
errors introduced by Cauchy-perturbative matching are very small, and that very
long term and accurate CPM evolutions can be achieved. Our tests include the
accretion and ring-down phase of a Schwarzschild black hole with CPM, where we
find that the discrete evolution introduces, with a low spatial resolution of
\Delta r = M/10, an error of 0.3% after an evolution time of 1,000,000 M. For a
black hole of solar mass, this corresponds to approximately 5 s, and is
therefore at the lower end of timescales discussed e.g. in the collapsar model
of gamma-ray burst engines.

directly in Mellin space without recourse to the usual momentum-fraction (or

powers of the propagators is an abstract number. The method retains the full
dependence on the Mellin variable and can be implemented in any program for
solving the IBP identities based on algebraic elimination, like Laporta.
General features of the method are: 1) faster reduction, 2) smaller number of
master integrals compared to the usual z-space approach and 3) the master
integrals satisfy difference instead of differential equations. This approach
generalizes previous results related to fully inclusive observables like the
recently calculated three-loop space-like anomalous dimensions and coefficient
functions in inclusive DIS to more general processes requiring separate
treatment of the various physical cuts. Many possible applications of this
method exist, the most notable being the direct evaluation of the three-loop

fundamental supersymmetric theory and its breaking mechanism. A well defined
theoretical framework is needed when higher-order corrections are included. We
propose such a scheme, Supersymmetry Parameter Analysis SPA, based on a
consistent set of conventions and input parameters. A repository for computer
programs is provided which connect parameters in different schemes and relate
the Lagrangian parameters to physical observables at LHC and high energy e+e-
linear collider experiments, i.e., masses, mixings, decay widths and production
cross sections for supersymmetric particles. In addition, programs for
calculating high-precision low energy observables, the density of cold dark
matter (CDM) in the universe as well as the cross sections for CDM search
experiments are included. The SPA scheme still requires extended efforts on
both the theoretical and experimental side before data can be evaluated in the
future at the level of the desired precision. We take here an initial step of
testing the SPA scheme by applying the techniques involved to a specific
supersymmetry reference point.

that the total number of fundamental degrees of freedom associated with any

of spacetime, let alone with Lorentz invariance. Considering the regions of
space just as general ``subsystems'' may help clarifying this problem. In usual
QFT the regions of space are, in fact, associated with a tensor product
decomposition of the total Hilbert space into ``subsystems'', but such a
decomposition is given a priori and the fundamental degrees of freedom are
labelled, already from the beginning, by the spacetime points. We suggest a new
strategy to identify ``localized regions'' as ``subsystems'' in a way which is
intrinsic to the total Hilbert-space dynamics of the quantum state of the

standard cosmology which does not make use of cosmological inflation. Crucial
ingredients of our scenario are brane gases, extra dimensions, and a confining
potential due to string gas effects which becomes dominant at string-scale
brane separations. The initial conditions are taken to be a statistically
homogeneous and isotropic hot brane gas in a space in which all spatial
dimensions are of string scale. The extra dimensions which end up as the
internal ones are orbifolded. The hot brane gas leads to an initial phase
(Phase 1) of isotropic expansion. Once the bulk energy density has decreased
sufficiently, a weak confining potential between the two orbifold fixed planes
begins to dominate, leading to a contraction of the extra spatial dimensions
(Phase 2). String modes which contain momentum about the dimensions
perpendicular to the orbifold fixed planes provide a repulsive potential which
prevents the two orbifold fixed planes from colliding. The radii of the extra
dimensions stabilize, and thereafter our three spatial dimensions expand as in
standard cosmology. The energy density after the stabilization of the extra
dimensions is of string scale, whereas the spatial volume has greatly increased
during Phases 1 and 2, thus leading to a non-inflationary solution of the
horizon and entropy problems.

with an {\it{external}} physical magnetic field reveals interesting features

non-trivial structures into the charge and mass of the particle and possibility
of the particle dynamics collapsing to a Hall type of motion. The dynamics is

method to compute the mass and action of $\Lambda \neq 0$ configurations. The
mass of the asymptotically de Sitter solutions computed in this way turns out
to take positive values in a specific parameter range and, for a relaxed set of
asymptotic boundary conditions, yields a counterexample to the maximal mass
conjecture.

understood and the regularity theory is complete, yet essentially nothing was
known without such bounds. We discuss here the theory of embedded (i.e.,
without self-intersections) minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space without a
priori bounds. The study is divided into three cases, depending on the topology
of the surface. Case one is where the surface is a disk, in case two the
surface is a planar domain (genus zero), and the third case is that of finite
(non-zero) genus. The complete understanding of the disk case is applied in
both cases two and three.
  As we will see, the helicoid, which is a double spiral staircase, is the most
important example of an embedded minimal disk. In fact, we will see that every
such disk is either a graph of a function or part of a double spiral staircase.
The helicoid was discovered to be a minimal surface by Meusnier in 1776.
  For planar domains the fundamental examples are the catenoid, also discovered
by Meusnier in 1776, and the Riemann examples discovered by Riemann in the
beginning of the 1860s. Finally, for general fixed genus an important example
is the recent example by Hoffman-Weber-Wolf of a genus one helicoid.
  In the last section we discuss why embedded minimal surfaces are
automatically proper. This was known as the Calabi-Yau conjectures for embedded
surfaces. For immersed surfaces there are counter-examples by Jorge-Xavier and
Nadirashvili.

this case the kink moves more slowly after an expansion-contraction cycle as a
consequence of loss of energy through radiation. All these effects are
numerically studied in the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations (both for the
sine-Gordon and for the phi^4 potential), and they are also studied within the
framework of the collective coordinate evolution equations for the width and
the center of mass of the kink. These collective coordinate evolution equations
are obtained with a procedure that allows us to consider even the case of large

experiment and the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model for domain chaos was resolved.
The Swift-Hohenberg (SH) domain-chaos model was integrated numerically to
acquire test images to study the effect of a finite image-size on the
extraction of xi from the structure factor (SF). The finite image size had a
significant effect on the SF determined with the Fourier-transform (FT) method.
The maximum entropy method (MEM) was able to overcome this finite image-size
problem and produced fairly accurate SFs for the relatively small image sizes
provided by experiments.
  Correlation lengths often have been determined from the second moment of the
SF of chaotic patterns because the functional form of the SF is not known.
Integration of several test functions provided analytic results indicating that
this may not be a reliable method of extracting xi. For both a Gaussian and a
squared SH form, the correlation length xibar=1/sigma, determined from the
variance sigma^2 of the SF, has the same dependence on the control parameter
epsilon as the length xi contained explicitly in the functional forms. However,
for the SH and the Lorentzian forms we find xibar ~ xi^1/2.
  Results for xi determined from new experimental data by fitting the
functional forms directly to the experimental SF yielded xi ~ epsilon^-nu} with
nu ~= 1/4 for all four functions in the case of the FT method, but nu ~= 1/2,
in agreement with the GL prediction, in the the case of the MEM. Over a wide
range of epsilon and wave number k, the experimental SFs collapsed onto a
unique curve when appropriately scaled by xi.

have observed polygons with up to 6 corners. It has been known for many years

free surface remains essentially flat. We speculate that the instability is
caused by the strong azimuthal shear due to the stationary walls and that it is
triggered by minute wobbling of the rotating plate. The slight asymmetry
induces a tendency for mode-locking between the plate and the polygon, where
the polygon rotates by one corner for each complete rotation of the plate.

typically shows a decrease in dynamic range and sensitivity. In order to assess
the effect of electrical coupling in the sensory periphery, we calculate the
response to a Poisson stimulus of a chain of excitable neurons modeled by
$n$-state Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata in two approximation levels. The
single-site mean field approximation is shown to give poor results, failing to
predict the absorbing state of the lattice, while the results for the pair
approximation are in good agreement with computer simulations in the whole
stimulus range. In particular, the dynamic range is substantially enlarged due
to the propagation of excitable waves, which suggests a functional role for
lateral electrical coupling. For probabilistic spike propagation the Hill
exponent of the response function is $\alpha=1$, while for deterministic spike
propagation we obtain $\alpha=1/2$, which is close to the experimental values
of the psychophysical Stevens exponents for odor and light intensities. Our
calculations are in qualitative agreement with experimental response functions

component is subadditive and the second superadditive; in the limit of
infinitely many copies only the usual free energy matters.
  Refined splittings of free energy into more than two independent
(non-increasing) terms can be defined by averaging over probability measures on
G that differ from the Haar measure.
  Even in the presence of a reference frame, these results provide lower bounds
on the amount of free energy that is lost after applying a covariant channel.
If the channel properly decreases one of these quantities, it decreases the
free energy necessarily at least by the same amount, since it is unable to
convert the different forms of free energies into each other.
