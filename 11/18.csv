numbers of galaxies that have stellar masses exceeding 10^8 Mo during this

""first-star"" objects,these objects are likely to have reionized their infall
regions prior to z=9, are dominated by atomic rather than molecular cooling,
and are not expected to be forming Population III stars. Galaxies exhibit a
slowly evolving comoving autocorrelation length from z=9-6, continuing a trend
seen at lower redshifts in which the rapidly dropping bias counteracts the
rapidly increasing matter clustering. These sources can be marginally detected
using current instruments, but modest increases in sensitivity or survey area
would yield significantly increased samples. We compare to current observations
of the z~6 rest-UV and Ly-alpha line luminosity functions, and find good
agreement. We also compare with the z~7 object observed by Egami et al., and
find that such systems are ubiquitous in our simulations. The intrinsic
Ly-alpha luminosity function evolves slowly from z=9-6, meaning that it should
also be possible to detect these objects with upcoming narrow band surveys such
as DAzLE. We make predictions for near-IR surveys with JWST, and show that
while a high density of sources will be found, Population III objects may
remain elusive. We present and compare simulations with several recipes for
superwind feedback, and show that while our broad conclusions are insensitive
to this choice, a feedback model based on momentum-driven winds is favored in
comparisons with available data. (abridged)

distributions of two samples of relaxed elliptical-like objects (ELOs)

(SF) has been phenomenologically implemented in the simulations in the
framework of the turbulent sequential scenario through a threshold gas density
and an efficiency parameter. Each ELO sample is characterized by the values
these parameters take. We have found that the (logarithms of the) ELO stellar
masses, projected stellar half-mass radii, and stellar central line-of-sight
(LOS) velocity dispersions define dynamical fundamental planes (FPs). Zero
points depend on the particular values that the SF parameters take, while
slopes do not change. The ELO samples have been found to show systematic trends
with the mass scale in both the relative content and the relative distributions
of the baryonic and the dark mass ELO components. The physical origin of these
trends lies in the systematic decrease, with increasing ELO mass, of the
relative dissipation experienced by the baryonic mass component along ELO mass
assembly, resulting in a tilt of the dynamical FP relative to the virial plane.
The dynamical FPs shown by the two ELO samples are consistent with that shown
by the SDSS elliptical sample in the same variables, with no further need for
any relevant contribution from stellar population effects to explain the
observed tilt. These effects could, however, have contributed to the scatter of
the observed FP, as the dynamical FPs have been found to be thinner than the
observed one. The results we report on hint, for the first time, at a possible
way to understand the tilt of the observed FP in a cosmological context.

spectra of AGN. It is argued that strong relativistic blurring of the
reflection spectrum should commonly be expected from objects accreting at a
high Eddington rate. The good agreement found between the local density in
massive black holes and the energy density in quasar and AGN light requires
that the accretion which built massive black holes was radiatively efficient,
involving thin discs extending within 6 gravitational radii. The soft excess
found in the spectra of many AGN can be explained by X-ray reflection when such
blurring is included in the spectral analysis. Some of the continuum
variability and in particular the puzzling variability of the broad iron line
can be explained by the strong light bending expected in the region immediately
around a black hole. Progress in understanding this behaviour in the brightest

unlikely to arise from variations in sensitivity among our data or from a

the Galactic plane has hampered previous investigations of its stellar content.
The HI mass of the cloud is 2.0 x 10^7 (d/27 kpc)^2 Msun, making Complex H one
of the most massive HVCs if its distance is > ~20 kpc. Virtually all similar HI
clouds in other galaxy groups are associated with LSB dwarf galaxies. We
selected mid-IR MSX sources in the direction of Complex H that appeared likely
to be star-forming regions and observed them at the wavelength of the CO 1-0
transition. 59 of the 60 observed sources show emission at Milky Way
velocities, and we detected no emission at velocities consistent with that of
Complex H. We use these observations to set an upper limit on the ongoing star
formation rate in the HVC of < 5 x 10^-4 Msun yr^-1. We also searched the 2MASS
database for evidence of any dwarf-galaxy-like stellar population in the
direction of the HVC and found no trace of a distant red giant population, with
an upper limit on the stellar mass of ~10^6 Msun. Given the lack of evidence
for either current star formation or an evolved population, we conclude that
Complex H cannot be a dwarf galaxy with properties similar to those of known
dwarfs. Complex H is therefore one of the most massive known HI clouds without
stars. If Complex H is self-gravitating, then it is one of the few known dark
galaxy candidates. These findings may offer observational support for the idea
that the Cold Dark Matter substructure problem is related to the difficulty of
forming stars in low-mass dark matter halos; alternatively, Complex H could be
an example of a cold accretion flow onto the Milky Way. [slightly abridged]

displacing it from the maxima. This issue is quite interesting for pNGB dark
energy in light of the recently discussed difficulties with embedding models
with $f_a > M_{Pl}$ in fundamental theory. A possible way around is provided by
models with several ultralight pNGBs, which can drive a short burst of very
late inflation {\it together} even if all of their decay constants obey $f_a <

assumption of a GM/r potential or a solution of Poisson's equation using one of

  Super-Eddington Accretion onto Stellar Mass Black holes","11 pages","Astrophys.J.651:1049-1058,2006","10.1086/507119",,"astro-ph",,"  The radiation spectra of many of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources
(ULXs) are dominated by a hard power law component, likely powered by a hot,
optically thin corona that Comptonizes soft seed photons emitted from a cool,
optically thick black hole accretion disk. Before its dissipation and
subsequent conversion into coronal photon power, the randomized gravitational
binding energy responsible for powering ULX phenomena must separate from the
mass of its origin by a means other than, and quicker than, electron
scattering-mediated radiative diffusion. Therefore, the release of accretion
power in ULXs is not necessarily subject to Eddington-limited photon trapping,
as long as it occurs in a corona. Motivated by these basic considerations, we
present a model of ULXs powered by geometrically thin accretion onto stellar
mass black holes. We argue that the radiative efficiency of the flow remains
high if the corona is magnetized or optically thin and the majority of the
accretion power escapes in the form of radiation rather than an outflow. Within
the context of the current black hole X-ray binary paradigm, our ULX model may
be viewed as an extension of the very high state observed in Galactic sources.

considered to be cluster members by two criteria. The U-B ~ B-V diagram plotted
for the astrometrical cluster members by the data taken from the Washington
catalogue of the UBV photometry in the galactic cluster fields (Hoag et
al.1961) made it possible to redefine the value of the color excess E(B-V)=0.40

self-consistent simulations operating in the context of a concordance
cosmological model. The values of the stellar mass, the stellar half-mass
radius and the stellar mean-square velocity have been measured in each ELO and
found to populate, at any z, a flattened ellipsoid close to a plane (the
dynamical plane, DP). Our simulations indicate that, at the intermediate zs
considered, individual ELOs evolve, increasing the values of these parameters
as a consequence of on-going mass assembly, but, nevertheless, their DP is
roughly preserved within its scatter, in agreement with observations of the
Fundamental Plane of ellipticals at different zs. We briefly discuss how this
lack of significant dynamical and structural evolution in ELO samples arises,
in terms of the two different phases operating in the mass aggregation history
of their dark matter halos. According with our simulations, most dissipation
involved in ELO formation takes place at the early violent phase, causing the
stellar mass, the stellar half-mass radius and the stellar mean-square velocity
parameters to settle down to the DP, and, moreover, the transformation of most
of the available gas into stars. In the subsequent slow phase, ELO stellar mass
growth preferentially occurs through non-dissipative processes, so that the DP
is preserved and the ELO star formation rate considerably decreases. These
results hint, for the first time, to a possible way of explaining, in the
context of cosmological simulations, different apparently paradoxical
observational results on ellipticals.

imaging of the central regions of a sample of 73 spiral galaxies in the H alpha
line and in optical broad bands, and derive information on the morphology of
massive star formation. Methods: We obtained images with the William Herschel
Telescope, mostly at a spatial resolution of below one second of arc. For most
galaxies, no H alpha imaging is available in the literature. We outline the
observing and data reduction procedures, list basic properties, and present the
I-band and continuum-subtracted H alpha images. We classify the morphology of
the nuclear and circumnuclear H alpha emission and explore trends with host
galaxy parameters. Results: We confirm that late-type galaxies have a patchy
circumnuclear appearance in H alpha, and that nuclear rings occur primarily in
spiral types Sa-Sbc. We identify a number of previously unknown nuclear rings,
and confirm that nuclear rings are predominantly hosted by barred galaxies.
Conclusions: Other than in stimulating nuclear rings, bars do not influence the
relative strength of the nuclear H alpha peak, nor the circumnuclear H alpha
morphology. Even though our selection criteria led to an over-abundance of
galaxies with close massive companions, we do not find any significant
influence of the presence or absence of a close companion on the relative
strength of the nuclear H alpha peak, nor on the H alpha morphology around the

over the same sky regions. Such informations, once applied to apparently
extended mid-infrared sources, which are indeed ``blends'' of two or more
different sources, allow us to disentangle the single counterparts and to split
the measured flux density into different components. We present the application
of this method to the 24 micron Spitzer archival data in the GOODS-EN1 test
field, where apparently extended, ``blended'' sources constitute about 20% of a
reliable sample of 983 sources detected above the 5-sigma threshold down to 23
microJy. As higher frequency data-set we have considered the public IRAC images
and catalogues on the same field. We show that the 24 micron sample is almost
unbiased down to ~40 microJy and the careful application of the deblending
procedure does not require any statistical completeness correction (at least at
the flux level considered). This is probed by direct comparison of our results
with those of Chary et al. (2004), who analysed the same data-set through
extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The deblending procedure reduces of about
30% the confusion limit of the MIPS 24 micron survey, allowing one to obtain
reliable source counts down to ~40 microJy. The extrapolation of the source
counts down to fainter fluxes suggests that our 24 micron sample is able to
resolve ~62% of the cosmic background down to a flux level of 38 microJy.

we suggested earlier is necessary to account for mm-wave emission, SEDs,

comparing the models with recent mid- and near-IR observations, we find that
the dust to gas mass ratio of small grains at the upper layers should be < 10 %
of the standard value. The grains that have disappeared from the upper layers
increase the dust to gas mass ratio of the disk interior; if those grains grow
to maximum sizes of the order of mm during the settling process, then both the
millimeter-wave fluxes and spectral slopes can be consistently explained.
Depletion and growth of grains can also enhance the ionization of upper layers,
enhancing the possibility of the magnetorotational instability for driving disk

bosons with non-resonant interactions, which is known to be equivalent to a
system of interacting spinless fermions and can be described using the
Luttinger liquid formalism, the resonant gas possesses novel features.
Depending on its parameters, the gas can be in one of three possible regimes.
In the simplest of those, it can still be described by the Luttinger liquid
theory, but its Fermi momentum cannot be larger than a certain cutoff momentum
dependent on the details of the interactions. In the other two regimes, it is
equivalent to a Luttinger liquid at low density only. At higher densities its
excitation spectrum develops a minimum, similar to the roton minimum in helium,
at momenta where the excitations are in resonance with the Fermi sea. As the
density of the gas is increased further, the minimum dips below the Fermi
energy, thus making the ground state unstable. At this point the standard
ground state gets replaced by a more complicated one, where not only the states
with momentum below the Fermi points, but also the ones with momentum close to
that minimum, get filled, and the excitation spectrum develops several
branches. We are unable so far to study this new regime in detail due to the
lack of the appropriate formalism.

because of their technological impacts for spintronic devices. In 2001
successful growth of GaMnN films showing room temperature ferromagnetism and
p-type conductivity has been reported. The estimated Curie temperature was 940K
at 5.7% of Mn, which is highest among diluted magnetic semiconductors ever been
reported. However, the electronic mechanism behind the ferromagnetic behaviour
has still been controversial. Here we show experimental evidence using the
ferromagnetic samples that Mn atoms are substitutionally dissolved into the GaN
lattice and they exhibit mixed valences of +2 (majority) and +3 (minority). The
p-type carrier density decreases significantly at very low temperatures. At the
same time, magnetization dramatically decreases. The results imply that the
ferromagnetic coupling between Mn atoms is mediated by holes in the mid-gap Mn

$U$ and positive on-site energy difference $\Delta$ (energy at A sites lower
than at B sites). In the weak-coupling limit, a bosonization analysis suggests
that for $N > 2$ the physics is qualitatively similar to the case $N = 2$ which
has already been studied: an intermediate phase emerges, which corresponds to a
bond-ordered ferroelectric insulator (FI) with spontaneously broken inversion
symmetry. We have determined the quantum phase diagram for the cases $N = 3$

very much in charge is best appreciated through the physics of a quantum point
contact. While discretization of its conductance is viewed as the exclusive
result of coherent, single-electron-wave transmission, this does not begin to
address the paramount feature of all metallic conduction: dissipation. A
perfect quantum point contact still has finite resistance, so its ballistic
carriers must dissipate the energy gained from the applied field. How do they

loading. Beyond a critical strain, the solid fails by the nucleation of
alternating bands of solid and {\em smectic} like phases accompanied by a jump

connected smoothly by a radiation-dominated phase. This setup allows us to
discuss the quantum-mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the
final amplitude of the well-defined zero mode. Using the Wronskian formulation,
we numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves, and find that
the effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the Kaluza-Klein modes is
subdominant, contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum. Thus
it is confirmed that the damping due to the Kaluza-Klein mode generation and
the enhancement due to the modification of the background Friedmann equation
are the two dominant effects, but they cancel each other, leading to the same
spectral tilt as the standard four-dimensional result. Kaluza-Klein gravitons
that escape from the brane contribute to the energy density of the dark
radiation at late times. We show that a tiny amount of the dark radiation is
generated due to this process.

includes mass terms and hence the gravitons are not free particles as in the
BFSS matrix model but harmonic oscillators or rotating particles. The
configuration we proposed consists of a rotating graviton and an elliptically
rotating graviton. It is applied to the two-body interaction of spherical
gravitons in the SO(6) symmetric space, and then to that of point-like
gravitons in the SO(3) symmetric space. In both cases the leading term of the

selective for K+ over Na+ at rates of K+ transport approaching the diffusion
limit. This selectivity is explained thermodynamically in terms of favorable
partitioning of K+ relative to Na+ in a narrow selectivity filter in the
channel. One mechanism for selectivity based on the atomic structure of the
KcsA channel invokes the size difference between K+ and Na+, and the molecular
complementarity of the selectivity filter with the larger K+ ion. An
alternative view holds that size-based selectivity is precluded because atomic
structural fluctuations are greater than the size difference between these two
ions. We examine these hypotheses by calculating the distribution of binding
energies for Na+ and K+ in a simplified model of the selectivity filter of the
KcsA channel. We find that Na+ binds strongly to the selectivity filter with a
mean binding energy substantially lower than that for K+. The difference is
comparable to the difference in hydration free energies of Na+ and K+ in bulk
aqueous solution. Thus, the average filter binding energies do not discriminate
Na+ from K+ when measured from the baseline of the difference in bulk hydration
free energies. Instead, Na+/K+ discrimination can be attributed to scarcity of
good binding configurations for Na+ compared to K+. That relative scarcity is
quantified as enhanced binding energy fluctuations, and is consistent with
predicted relative constriction of the filter by Na+.

such that it is possible for the computer code to simulate the action. An
analysis of Boltzmann's factor is offered and serves as the link between the
temperature of the ensemble and the parameter that is used to determine if a
spin is in the up state or the down state. The specifics of the code are
discussed and the spins are shown to follow the rules of interaction governed
by the physical collisions that can take place. Lastly, graphs of the

could be interesting to compare our Universe with its models. It may happen
that the differences between the model and reality can be made
indistinguishable, to the point that it may seem acceptable to consider reality
as a gigantic program, a 'mother computation' running in a Universal Computer.
The computational interpretation of reality is here adopted for introducing
concepts that are common in computer science, they may offer a new insight. For
instance, code and memory usage optimization techniques are common in computer
science because they improve the performances at a reduced hardware cost.
According to the concepts discussed in this paper, the possibility of
recognizing the effects of optimization rules in a physical reality will allow
us to discriminate if our reality is fundamental or the result of a large
computation. Conversely, code and memory optimization has side effects, if it
is present in our Universe it can produce many interesting phenomena, some seem
readily recognizable, others only wait to be discovered.

distribution and the average molar mass accurately using the static light
scattering (SLS) technique when the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is valid
for dilute poly-disperse homogenous spherical particles in dispersion, but also
enables us to have insight into the theoretical analysis of the dimensionless
shape parameter $\rho$. With the method, a new size, static radii $R_{s}$, can
be measured. Based on the new static particle size information, detailed
investigation of the normalized time auto-correlation function of the scattered
light intensity $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ reveals that there exist three different
particle sizes: the static radius, hydrodynamic radius and apparent
hydrodynamic radius that is the hydrodynamic radius obtained using the
cumulants method. With a simple assumption that the hydrodynamic radius $R_{h}$
is in proportion to the static radius $R_{s}$, the expected values of
$g^{(2)}(\tau) $ calculated based on the static and commercial particle size
information are consistent with the experimental data. With the assistance of
simulated data, the apparent hydrodynamic radius is discussed. The results show
that the apparent hydrodynamic radius is different from the mean hydrodynamic
radius and is determined by the optical, hydrodynamic characteristics and size
distribution of particles and scattering vector. The analysis also reveals that
$\rho$ is determined by not only the structure of particles but also the
relationship between the optical and hydrodynamic characteristics of particles
even for mono-disperse model.

scattering (SLS) technique or provided by the supplier measured using the
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) technique for dilute
Poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) microgel and standard polystyrene latex samples
in dispersion respectively. The results show that the narrow particle size
distribution that can be measured accurately using the SLS technique is not
suited to the determination by the DLS technique and the particle size
distribution obtained from the DLS technique is different from the value
provided by the supplier. With the assistance of the simulated data of the
normalized time auto-correlation function of the scattered light intensity
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$, the effects of the particle size distribution on the
nonexponentiality of $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ measured at a scattering angle of
30$^\mathrm o$ are investigated. The analysis reveals that the influences of
the particle size distribution are small on the nonexponentiality of
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$ and very large on the initial slope of the logarithm of
$g^{(2)}(\tau)$. The values of the apparent hydrodynamic radius are also
largely influenced by the particle size distribution and the difference between
the distributions of the apparent hydrodynamic radius and hydrodynamic radius
of particles is determined by the method of cumulants.

incoming noise with some time advance. In an duct for example this advance must
be larger than the delays in the secondary path from the control source to the
error sensor. In this paper it is shown that, in some cases, the advance
required for perfect noise cancellation is theoretically infinite because the
inverse of the secondary path, which is required for control, can include an
infinite non-causal response. This is shown to be the result of two mechanisms:
in the single-channel case (one control source and one error sensor), this can
arise because of strong echoes in the control path. In the multi-channel case
this can arise even in free field simply because of an unfortunate placing of
sensors and actuators. In the present paper optimal feedforward control is
derived through analytical and numerical computations, in the time and
frequency domains. It is shown that, in practice, the advance required for
significant noise attenuation can be much larger than the secondary path
delays. Practical rules are also suggested in order to prevent infinite
non-causality from appearing.

real-time control strategy for reduction of the noise scattered from a

scattered noise by linear filtering of the total noise measured around the

Filtered-Error Least-Mean-Squares algorithm then leads to the adaptive filters
which drive the secondary sources. The paper provides the numerical simulations
using a Boundary Element Method which helped in designing a feasible experiment
in an anechoic chamber with a limited number of control sources. Eventually a
real-time pure-tone implementation with 14 ordinary loudspeakers and a large
body is shown to yield on average a 10 dB reduction of the scattered noise at
the error sensors, which is close to the optimum reduction predicted by the
numerical simulations for the sensor arrangement.
