employed by Henriksen (2004) for a one degree of freedom (per particle)
collisionless system, to those presented in a paper by Binney (2004) based on
an exact one degree of freedom model. We find agreement in detail but in
addition we show that the isolated 1D system is self-similar and therefore
unrelaxed. Fine graining of this system recovers much less prominent wave-like
structure than in a spherically symmetric isotropic 3D system. The rate of
central flattening is also reduced in the 1D system. We take this to be
evidence that relaxation of collisionless systems proceeds ultimately by way of
short wavelength Landau damping. N-body systems, both real and simulated, can
be trapped in an incompletely relaxed state because of a break in the cascade
of energy to small scales. This may be due to the rapid dissipation of the
small scale oscillations in an isolated system, to the existence of conserved
quantities such as angular momentum, or to the failure in simulations to
resolve sub-Jeans length scales. Such a partially relaxed state appears to be
the NFW state, and is to be expected especially in young systems. The NFW core
is shown to be isolated. In non-isolated systems continuing coarse-grained
relaxation should be towards a density core in solid body rotation.

circumstellar material on the observed infrared colors of high mass stars
embedded in molecular clouds. We highlight differences between 3-D clumpy and
1-D smooth models which can affect the interpretation of data. We discuss
several important properties of the emergent spectral energy distribution
(SED): More near-infrared light (scattered and direct from the central source)
can escape than in smooth 1-D models. The near- and mid-infrared SED of the
same object can vary significantly with viewing angle, depending on the clump
geometry along the sightline. Even the wavelength-integrated flux can vary with
angle by more than a factor of two. Objects with the same average circumstellar
dust distribution can have very different near-and mid-IR SEDs depending on the
clump geometry and the proximity of the most massive clump to the central
source.
  Although clumpiness can cause similar objects to have very different SEDs,
there are some observable trends. Near- and mid-infrared colors are sensitive
to the weighted average distance of clumps from the central source and to the
magnitude of clumpy density variations (smooth-to-clumpy ratio). Far-infrared
emission remains a robust measure of the total dust mass. We present simulated
SEDs, colors, and images for 2MASS and Spitzer filters. We compare to
observations of some UCHII regions and find that 3-D clumpy models fit better
than smooth models. In particular, clumpy models with fractal dimensions in the
range 2.3-2.8, smooth to clumpy ratios of <50%, and density distributions with
shallow average radial density profiles fit the SEDs best.

distributions consistent with the Milky Way GC system. Our principal results,

elliptical galaxies formed from major mergers can exhibit significant rotation
at large radii ($\sim$20 kpc) due to the conversion of initial orbital angular
momentum into intrinsic angular momentum of the remnant. MPCs show higher
central velocity dispersions than MRCs for most major merger models. $V_{\rm
m}/{\sigma}_{0}$ (where $V_{\rm m}$ and ${\sigma}_{0}$, are the GCS maximum
rotational velocity and central velocity dispersion of respectively) ranges
from 0.2--1.0 and 0.1--0.9 for the MPCs and MRCs respectively, within $6R_{\rm
e}$ for the remnant elliptical. For most merger remnant ellipticals, $V_{\rm
m}/{\sigma}_{0}$ of GCSs within $6R_{\rm e}$ is greater than that of the field
stars within $2R_{\rm e}$. The radial profiles of rotational velocities and
velocity dispersions of the GCSs depend upon the orbital configuration of the

flattened early-type galaxies, formed through mergers with small mass ratios

(Lx~10^43 erg s^-1) AGN peak at z~0.7, while high luminosity AGN (Lx>10^45 erg
s^-1) peak at z~2.0. A pure luminosity evolution model (PLE) can instead be
rejected. There is evidence that the fraction of absorbed (Nh>10^22 cm^-2) AGN
decreases with the intrinsic X-ray luminosity, and increases with the redshift.
Our best fit solution provides a good fit to the observed counts, the cosmic
X-ray background, and to the observed fraction of absorbed AGN as a function of

range of one dimensional problems in both adiabatic and isothermal MHD. In this

of the aspects considered in papers I and II and paying particular attention to
the code's ability to maintain the div B = 0 constraint associated with the

method recently proposed by Dedner et al. (2002) in combination with the
consistent formulation of the MHD equations in the presence of non-zero
magnetic divergence derived in papers I and II. Various projection methods for
maintaining the divergence-free condition are also examined. Finally the
algorithm is tested against a wide range of multidimensional problems used to
test recent grid-based MHD codes. A particular finding of these tests is that
in SPMHD the magnitude of the divergence error is dependent on the number of
neighbours used to calculate a particle's properties and only weakly dependent
on the total number of particles. Whilst many improvements could still be made
to the algorithm, our results suggest that the method is ripe for application

between the radio and the high-energy radiation. We develop a new model where
the MQ jet is dynamically dominated by cold protons and radiatively dominated
by relativistic leptons. The matter content and power of the jet are both
related with the accretion process. The magnetic field is assumed to be close
to equipartition, although it is attached to and dominated by the jet matter.
For the relativistic particles in the jet, their maximum energy depends on both
the acceleration efficiency and the energy losses. The model takes into account
the interaction of the relativistic jet particles with the magnetic field and
all the photon and matter fields. Such interaction produces significant amounts
of radiation from radio to very high energies through synchrotron, relativistic
Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton (IC) processes. Variability of the emission
produced by changes in the accretion process (e.g. via orbital eccentricity) is
also expected. The effects of the gamma-ray absorption by the external photon
fields on the gamma-ray spectrum have been taken into account, revealing clear
spectral features that might be observed. This model is consistent to the

recent multiparameter fits is as follows. We first study the values quoted for
$r, \alpha_s, w+1 (w_0+1), w_1$ and $\Omega_k$, arriving at the conclusion that
they do not differ significantly from zero, and their correlations to other
parameters are insignificant. In what follows they can be therefore fixed. The
neutrino mass sum $\Sigma m_{\nu}$ also does not differ significantly from
zero, but since neutrinos are massive their sum must be included as a free
parameter. We then compare the values obtained in five large flat-space
determinations of the parameters $\Sigma m_{\nu}, \omega_b, \omega_m, h, \tau,
n_s, A_s$ and $\sigma_8$. For these we compute the medians and the
17-percentile and 83-percentile errors by a described procedure.

X-ray source similar to gamma Cas. From time-serial echelle data obtained over
two weeks during 2005 January and February, we find several remarkable
characteristics in the star's optical spectrum. The line profiles show rapid
variations on some nights which can be most likely be attributed to irregularly
occurring and short-lived migrating subfeatures. Such features have only been
observed to date in gamma Cas and AB Dor, two stars for which it is believed
magnetic fields force circumstellar clouds to corotate over the stellar
surface. The star's optical spectrum also exhibits a number of mainly FeII and
HeI emission features with profiles typical of an optically thin disk viewed
edge-on. Using spectral synthesis techniques, we find that its temperature is
9800K +/-300K, that its projected area is a remarkably large 100 stellar areas,
and its emitting volume resides at a distance of 1 AU from the star. We also
find that the star's absorption profiles extend to +/-1000 km/s, a fact which
we cannot explain. Otherwise, HD110432 and gamma Cas share similarly peculiar
X-ray and optical characteristics such as high X-ray temperature, erratic X-ray
variability on timescales of a few hours, optical emission lines, and
submigrating features in optical line profiles. Because of these similarities,
we suggest that this star is a new member of a select class of ""gamma Cas

transition rates are computed with a one dimensional Poisson-Schroedinger
solver which allows the computation of the tunnelling currents and of
generation and recombination rates between the outer reservoir and localized
states in the dielectric layer. Comparison between simulations and experiments
available in the literature provides useful insights of the storing mechanisms.
In particular, simulations allow us to rule out that electrons are stored in
confined states in the conduction band of silicon nanocrystals, whereas they
suggest that electrons are actually trapped in localized states in the silicon
gap at an energy close to the silicon valence band edge, and located at the

which exhibits a large moment (~4.95mu_B/Mn) and high degree of spin
polarization. The system has a ferromagnetic transition temperature of 148K.
Isothermal magnetization measurements at 5K reveal that the material is a soft
ferromagnet with a magnetization saturating at about 500Oe and a coercive field
of < 5 Oe. We determine the transport spin polarization of this material from
Point Contact Andreev Reflection measurements to be 66% thereby making this
material potentially important for spintronic applications.

The region of intermediate temperatures, where the absolute values of the

shows the importance of the anomalous averages for the intermediate and,

vanish by a small substitution (x = 0.3) of Y for Ca. Systematics in ac and dc

dataset is divided into two sub-datasets: the pure categorical dataset and the
pure numeric dataset. Next, existing well established clustering algorithms
designed for different types of datasets are employed to produce corresponding
clusters. Last, the clustering results on the categorical and numeric dataset
are combined as a categorical dataset, on which the categorical data clustering
algorithm is used to get the final clusters. Our contribution in this paper is
to provide an algorithm framework for the mixed attributes clustering problem,
in which existing clustering algorithms can be easily integrated, the
capabilities of different kinds of clustering algorithms and characteristics of
different types of datasets could be fully exploited. Comparisons with other

Lagrangian, and is found numerically to be large; (2) Numerical results for

extend into this region, and give predictions for the functional form of pionic

twist have apparent infrared singularities in the chiral limit results from
expanding about the incorrect vacuum state. Shifting to the correct vacuum (as
can be done using chiral perturbation theory) the apparent singularities are
summed into non-singular, and furthermore predicted, forms. I further argue
that there is no breakdown in the Symanzik expansion in powers of lattice

color superconductor phase) is discussed using the quasi-chemical equilibrium
theory at a relatively low density region near the deconfinement phase
transition, where dynamical quark-pair fluctuations are assumed to be described
as bosonic degrees of freedom (diquarks). A general formulation is given for
the diquark formation and particle-antiparticle pair-creation processes in the
relativistic flamework, and some interesting properties are shown, which are
characteristic for the relativistic many-body system. Behaviors of transition
temperature and phase diagram of the quark-diquark matter are generally
presented in model parameter space, and their asymptotic behaviors are also
discussed. As an application to the color superconductivity, the transition
temperatures and the quark and diquark density profiles are calculated in case
with constituent/current quarks, where the diquark is in bound/resonant state.
We obtained $T_C \sim 60-80$ MeV for constituent quarks and $T_C \sim 130$ MeV
for current quarks at a moderate density ($\rho_b \sim 3 \rho_0$). The method
is also developed to include interdiquark interactions into the quasi-chemical
equilibrium theory within a mean-field approximation, and it is found that a
possible repulsive diquark-diquark interaction lowers the transition
temperature by nearly 50%.

problems. The classes of monotone or convex (and monotone) densities can be
viewed as special cases of the classes of k-monotone densities. A density g is
said to be k-monotone if its successive derivatives up to order k-2 are
alternately negative or positive, with the k-2 derivative convex (or concave)
according as k is even (or odd) respectively. g is simply nonincreasing if k=1.
These classes of shape constrained densities bridge the gap between the classes
of monotone (1-monotone) and convex decreasing (2-monotone) densities for which
asymptotic results are known, and the class of completely monotone densities
with k infinite.
  In this series of four papers we consider both (nonparametric) Maximum
Likelihood estimators and Least Squares estimators of a k-monotone density. In
this first part (part 1), we prove existence of the estimators and give
characterizations. We also establish consistency properties, and show that the

provide asymptotic minimax risk lower bounds for estimating a k-monotone

fixed point x_0 under the assumption that the k-th derivative of g_0 at x_0 is

Baumslag about standard wreath products; on the other hand, this provides
nontrivial examples of finitely presented groups. For instance, we obtain two
quasi-isometric finitely presented groups, one of which is torsion-free and the

  Motivated by the characterization above, we discuss the following question:
which finitely generated groups can have a finitely generated subgroup with
finitely many double cosets? The discussion involves properties related to the

space of functions on the two-torus, parametrized by a polynomial $P$ (the
Wess-Zumino-Landau-Ginzburg model). The second is a family $\mu_\cG^{s,t}$ of
measures on a space $\cG$ of maps from $\P^1$ to a Lie group (the
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model). Finally we study a family $\mu_{M,G}^{s,t}$

structure and Quantum Chromodynamics. New experimental data on nucleon spin
structure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high
momentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture of the transition region
from the {\it confinement} regime of the theory to its {\it asymptotic freedom}
regime. Insight for some aspects of the theory is gained by exploring lower
moments of spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules (i.e. the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn, Bjorken and Burkhardt-Cottingham). These moments are
expressed in terms of an operator product expansion using quark and gluon
degrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The sum rules are
verified to a good accuracy assuming that no singular behavior of the structure
functions is present at very high excitation energies. The higher twist
contributions have been examined through the moments evolution as the moments
evolution as the momentum transfer varies from higher to lower values.
Furthermore, QCD-inspired low-energy effective theories, which explicitly
include chiral symmetry breaking, are tested at low momentum transfers. The
validity of these theories is further examined as the momentum transfer
increases to moderate values. It is found that chiral perturbation calculations
agree reasonably well with the first moment of the spin structure function

the nuclear matter symmetry energy are studied in the Skyrme Hartree-Fock
model. From the most recent analysis of the isospin diffusion data in heavy-ion
collisions based on an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model with
in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, a value of $L=88\pm 25$ MeV for the
slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density is extracted, and
this imposes stringent constraints on both the parameters in the Skyrme
effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei.
Predicted thickness of the neutron skin is $0.22\pm 0.04$ fm for $% ^{208}$Pb,
$0.29\pm 0.04$ fm for $^{132}$Sn, and $0.22\pm 0.04$ fm for $% ^{124}$Sn.

electromagnetic waves is predicted and analysed numerically in thick periodic
holographic gratings in a slab with the mean permittivity that is larger than
that of the surrounding media. This pattern is shown to exist in the geometry
of grazing-angle scattering (GAS), that is when the scattered wave (+1
diffracted order) in the slab propagates almost parallel to the slab (grating)
boundaries. The predicted resonances are demonstrated to be unrelated to
resonant generation of the conventional guided modes of the slab. Their
physical explanation is associated with resonant generation of a completely new
type of eigenmodes in a thick slab with a periodic grating. These new slab
eigenmodes are generically related to the grating; they do not exist if the
grating amplitude is zero. The field structure of these eigenmodes and their
dependence on structural and wave parameters is analysed. The results are
extended to the case of GAS of guided modes in a slab with a periodic groove
array of small corrugation amplitude and small variations in the mean thickness
of the slab at the array boundaries.

dependencies of the absorptivity are demonstrated to have significant and

non-Newtonian properties and non-uniformities of the fluid layer on the

to quantitatively study ultra-violet and other high energy emissions in

thin coatings are postulated to reduce power consumption and reduce
overheating. The power consumption and lifetime of aluminium nitride and
amorphous hydrogenated diamond-like carbon coatings have been tested by
current-voltage and endurance tests. Diamond-like carbon coatings were
promising, performing better in endurance tests than uncoated samples, but
further work is required to characterise the coating's physical properties and
its effects on field emission. The thermal conductivity of the coating material
had little effect on measured sample lifetimes. Aluminium nitride had reduced
power consumption compared to diamond-like carbon coated and uncoated samples.
A thin (~5 nm) layer of aluminium nitride was found to be optimal, meeting
European Space Agency specifications for the neutraliser engineering model.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations cannot reach the low shear rates and large

hydrophobic channel walls and a fluid by means of a multi-phase lattice
Boltzmann model. Our mesoscopic approach overcomes the limitations of MD
simulations and can reach the small flow velocities of known experiments. We
reproduce results from experiments at small Knudsen numbers and other
simulations, namely an increase of slip with increasing liquid-solid
interactions, the slip being independent of the flow velocity, and a decreasing
slip with increasing bulk pressure. Within our model we develop a semi-analytic
approximation of the dependence of the slip on the pressure.
