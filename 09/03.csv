luminosity class V to III B-type stars for the Delta a photometric system which
was originally developed to detect magnetic chemically peculiar objects of the
upper main sequence (early B-type to early F-type) at 5200A. However, this
system provides the index (g1-y) which shows an excellent correlation with
(B-V) as well as (b-y) and can be used as an indicator of the effective
temperature. This is supplemented by a very accurate color-magnitude diagram, y
or V versus (g1-y), which can be used, for example, to determine the reddening,
distance and age of an open cluster. This makes the Delta a photometric system
an excellent tool to investigate the Hertzsprung-Russell-Diagram (HRD) in more
detail. Using the reddening-free parameters and already established
calibrations within the Stromgren uvbybeta, Geneva 7-color and Johnson UBV
systems, a polynomial fit of third degree for the averaged effective
temperatures to the individual (g1-y)0 values was derived. For this purpose,
data from the literature as well as new observations were taken resulting in
225 suitable bright normal B-type objects. The statistical mean of the error
for this sample is 238K which is sufficient to investigate the HRD of distant
galactic open clusters as well as extragalactic aggregates in the future.

characteristics such as mass and number of members. In the 3-dimensional case,
we find a significant correlation between the mass and halo shape; massive
systems are more prolate than small haloes. We detect a source of strong
systematics in estimates of the triaxiality of a halo, which is found to be a
strong function of the number of members; LCDM haloes usually characterised by
triaxial shapes, slightly bent toward prolate forms, appear more oblate when
taking only a small subset of the halo particles. The ellipticities of observed
2PIGG and SDSS-DR3GC groups are found to be strongly dependent on the number of
group members, so that poor groups appear more elongated than rich ones.
However, this is again an artifact caused by poor statistics and not an
intrinsic property of the galaxy groups, nor an effect from observational
biases. We interpret these results with the aid of a GALFORM mock 2PIGG
catalogue. When comparing the group ellipticities in mock and real catalogues,
we find an excellent agreement between the trends of shapes with number of
group members. When carefully taking into account the effects of low number
statistics, we find that more massive groups are consistent with more elongated
shapes. Finally, our studies find no significant correlations between the shape

study vortex dynamics in rotating, shearing, stratified systems (e.g. the
atmosphere of gas giant planets, protoplanetary disks around newly forming
protostars). The time-independent background state is stably stratified in the
vertical direction and has a unidirectional linear shear flow aligned with one
horizontal axis. Superposed on this background state is an unsteady, subsonic
flow that is evolved with the Euler equations subject to the anelastic
approximation to filter acoustic phenomena. A Fourier-Fourier basis in a set of
quasi-Lagrangian coordinates that advect with the background shear is used for
spectral expansions in the two horizontal directions. For the vertical
direction, two different sets of basis functions have been implemented: (1)
Chebyshev polynomials on a truncated, finite domain, and (2) rational Chebyshev
functions on an infinite domain. Use of this latter set is equivalent to
transforming the infinite domain to a finite one with a cotangent mapping, and
using cosine and sine expansions in the mapped coordinate. The nonlinear
advection terms are time integrated explicitly, whereas the Coriolis force,
buoyancy terms, and pressure/enthalpy gradient are integrated semi-implicitly.
We show that internal gravity waves can be damped by adding new terms to the
Euler equations. The code exhibits excellent parallel performance with the
Message Passing Interface (MPI). As a demonstration of the code, we simulate
the merger of two 3D vortices in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk.

the method, we micromagnetically simulated FORCs for PRM with known SFD and
compare the extracted SFD with the SFD obtained by means of two different
methods that are based on recoil loops, too, which however rely on mean-field
approximations and assumptions on the shape of the SFD. The FORC method turns
out to be the most accurate algorithm over a broad range of dipolar interaction
strengths, where the other methods overestimate the width of the SFD.

found insufficient to stabilize the orbital ordered state. On the other hand,
e-e interaction ($\simeq 1.7$ eV) not only induces orbital ordering, but also
greatly facilitates the Jahn-Teller distortion via enhanced localization.
Further experimental means to quantify the competition between these two

  method","12 pages including 10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.supr-con",,"  We generalize the string method, originally designed for the study of
thermally activated rare events, to the calculation of quantum tunneling rates.
This generalization is based on the analogy between quantum mechanics and
statistical mechanics in the path-integral formalism. The quantum string method
first locates, in the space of imaginary-time trajectories, the minimal action
path (MAP) between two minima of the imaginary-time action. From the MAP, the
saddle-point (``bounce'') action associated with the exponential barrier
penetration probability is obtained and the pre-exponential factor (the ratio
of determinants) for the tunneling rate evaluated using stochastic simulation.
The quantum string method is implemented to calculate the zero-temperature
escape rates for the metastable zero-voltage states in the current-biased
Josephson tunnel junction model. In the regime close to the critical bias
current, direct comparison of the numerical and analytical results yields good
agreement. Our calculations indicate that for the nanojunctions encountered in
many experiments today, the (absolute) escape rates should be measurable at
bias current much below the critical current.

behaviours of itinerant d-electron and localized 4f-electron materials. An
intermediate state, found notably in Pu-based materials whose 5f electrons are
neither fully localized nor itinerant, is particularly challenging to
understand. Superconductivity appearing in some actinide materials provides
clues to the nature of the 5f electrons. PuCoGa5, the first Pu-based
superconductor, is superconducting at Tc=18.5 K. This relatively high Tc is
unprecedented in any other actinide system but is typical of itinerant electron
compounds in which superconductivity is mediated by phonons. Recent studies of
PuCoGa5 show that its superconductivity is not phonon-mediated; rather, these
experiments are consistent with superconductivity produced by antiferromagnetic
fluctuations of nearly localized 5f electrons. Similarities of PuCoGa5 with the
superconducting and normal states of isostructural 4f analogues CeMIn5 (M=Co,

increasing detector masses (from 100 ton to 100 kton). The ICARUS R&D program
has already demonstrated that the technology is mature with the test of the
T600 detector at surface. Since 2003 we have been working with the conceptual
design of a very large LAr TPC with a mass of 50-100 kton to be built by
employing a monolithic technology based on the use of industrial, large volume,
cryogenic tankers developed by the petro-chemical industry. Such a detector, if
realized, would be an ideal match for a Super Beam, Beta Beam or Neutrino
Factory, covering a broad physics program that includes the detection of
atmospheric, solar and supernova neutrinos, and searches for proton decay, in
addition to the rich accelerator neutrino physics program. A ""test module"" with
a mass of the order of 10 kton operated underground or at shallow depth would
represent a necessary milestone towards the realization of the 100 kton
detector, with an interesting physics program on its own. In parallel, physics
is calling for a shorter scale application of the LAr TPC technique at the
level of 100 ton mass, for low energy neutrino physics and for use as a near
station setup in future long baseline neutrino facilities. We outline here the
main physics objectives and the design of such a detector for operation in the
upcoming T2K neutrino beam. We finally present the result of a series of R&D
studies conducted with the aim of validating the design of the proposed

introduced class is a generalization of the classes of triangular systems
investigated before. The solution of the problem is based on the approach
proposed in another work [18] devoted to the triangular systems of the Volterra
equations and written jointly with W.H. Schmidt by the current authors. This
yields the same properties of the considered class of triangular systems as
those established in [18] for the Volterra systems. As well as in [18], for the
current class of triangular systems, it is proven that there exists a family of
continuous controls that solve the global controllability problem for the
considered class and continuously depend on the initial and the terminal
states. As well as in [18], this implies the global controllability of the
bounded perturbations of the current class. In contrast with [18], to prove the
existence of the desired family of open-loop controls, we construct a family of
closed-loop ones each of which steers the corresponding initial state into an
appropriate neighborhood of an appropriate terminal point.

in quantum theory as an external parameter to the system, and (ii) propositions
about the time-of-arrival appear naturally when one considers histories. The
definition of time-of-arrival probabilities is straightforward in stochastic
processes. The difficulties that arise in quantum theory are due to the fact
that the time parameter of Schr\""odinger's equation does not naturally define a
probability density at the continuum limit, but also because the procedure one
follows is sensitive on the interpretation of the reduction procedure. We
consider the issue in Copenhagen quantum mechanics and in history-based schemes
like consistent histories. The benefit of the latter is that it allows a proper
passage to the continuous limit--there are however problems related to the
quantum Zeno effect and decoherence. We finally employ the histories-based
description to construct Positive-Operator-Valued-Measures (POVMs) for the
time-of-arrival, which are valid for a general Hamiltonian. These POVMs
typically depend on the resolution of the measurement device; for a free
particle, however, this dependence cancels in the physically relevant regime
and the POVM coincides with that of Kijowski.

critical infinite spin chains in a general setting, using methods of conformal
field theory. Conformal symmetry imposes that the single-copy entanglement for
critical many-body systems scales as E_1(\rho_L)=(c/6) \log L- (c/6)
(\pi^2/\log L) + O(1/L), where L is the number of constituents in a block of an
infinite chain and c corresponds to the central charge. This proves that from a
single specimen of a critical chain, already half the entanglement can be
distilled compared to the rate that is asymptotically available. The result is
substantiated by a quantitative analysis for all translationally invariant
quantum spin chains corresponding to general isotropic quasi-free fermionic
models. An analytic example of the XY model shows that away from criticality
the above simple relation is only maintained near the quantum phase transition

periodic potential and compare between thermal and BEC initial conditions. We
observe ballistic transport for all values of well depth and initial
conditions, and the measured expansion velocity for thermal atoms is in
excellent agreement with a single-particle model. For weak wells, the expansion
of the BEC is also in excellent agreement with single-particle theory, using an
effective temperature. We observe a crossover to a new regime for the BEC case
as the well depth is increased, indicating the importance of interactions on
quantum transport.
