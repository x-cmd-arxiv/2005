reionization era, which probably started at considerably higher redshifts.
However, there also appears to be a substantial cosmic variance in the
transmission of the IGM, both along some lines of sight, and among different
lines of sight, in this intriguing redshift regime. We suggest that this is
indicative of a spatially uneven reionization, possibly caused by the
bias-driven primordial clustering of the reionization sources. There is also
some independent evidence for a strong clustering of QSOs at z ~ 4 - 5 and
galaxies around them, supporting the idea of the strong biasing of the first
luminous sources at these redshifts. Larger samples of high-z QSOs are needed
in order to provide improved, statistically significant constraints for the
models of these phenomena. We expect that the Palomar-Quest (PQ) survey will
soon provide a new set of QSOs to be used as cosmological probes in this

system acts as an accelerator of charged particles whose energy is limited to
E_p < 3 TeV and which are ejected from the magnetosphere of the primary with
the rate L_kin < 10^{32} erg/s. Due to the curvature radiation of the
accelerated primary electrons the system should appear as a source of soft
gamma-rays (~ 100 keV) with the luminosity < 3x10^{27} erg/s. The TeV emission
of the system is dominated by the inverse Compton scattering of optical photons
on the ultrarelativistic electrons. The optical photons are mainly contributed
by the normal companion and the stream of material flowing through the
magnetosphere of the white dwarf. The luminosity of the TeV source depends on
the state of the system (flaring/quiet) and is limited to < 5x10^{29} erg/s.

however. In the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and other
supersymmetric models with an extended Higgs sector, a very light CP-odd Higgs
boson can naturally arise making it possible for a very light neutralino to
annihilate efficiently enough to avoid being overproduced in the early
Universe.
  In this article, we explore the characteristics of a supersymmetric model
needed to include a very light neutralino, 100 MeV $< \mcnone <$ 20 GeV, using
the NMSSM as a prototype. We discuss the most important constraints from
Upsilon decays, $b \to s \gamma$, $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ and the magnetic moment
of the muon, and find that a light bino or singlino neutralino is allowed, and
can be generated with the appropriate relic density.
  It has previously been shown that the positive detection of dark matter
claimed by the DAMA collaboration can be reconciled with other direct dark
matter experiments such as CDMS II if the dark matter particle is rather light,
between about 6 and 9 GeV. A singlino or bino-like neutralino could easily fall
within this range of masses within the NMSSM. Additionally, models with sub-GeV
neutralinos may be capable of generating the 511 keV gamma-ray emission
observed from the galactic bulge by the INTEGRAL/SPI experiment.

Inflation can indeed begin. Here we modify a suggestion due to Linde and assume
that the Universe was born with the topology of a torus; however, we propose
that the size of the torus is to be predicted by the FST wave function. The
latter does predict an initial size for the torus at about the string scale,

mixing preserves any initial homogeneity until Inflation can begin at a

a probabilistic argument based on regeneration times. We prove an annealed SLLN

neutrosophic cognitive maps, has systematically invented mathematical tools
like bimatrices, trimatrices, n-matrices, bigraphs, trigraphs and n-graphs and
describe some of its properties. These concepts are also extended
neutrosophically in this book. Using these new tools we define fuzzy cognitive
bimaps, fuzzy cognitive trimaps, fuzzy relational bimaps and fuzzy relational
trimaps which exploit the new notions of bimatrices, bigraphs, trimatrices and
trigraphs. It is worth mentioning that these can be extended to n-array models
as a simple exercise.
  The main advantage of these models are:
  1. Comparative study of the views stage-by-stage is possible. 2. Several
experts opinion can be compared not only at each stage but also the final
result can easily be compared. 3. Saves time and economy.
  This book is organized into four chapters. The first chapter recalls the
basic concepts of bimatrices and neutrosophic bimatrices. Second chapter
introduces several new notions of graphs like bigraphs, trigraphs and their
properties. Chapter three illustrates how these new tools are used in the
construction of fuzzy cognitive bimaps, trimaps and n-maps and fuzzy relational
bimaps, trimaps and n-maps. The neutrosophic analogues of chapter 3 is carried
out in the fourth chapter. In this book, we have given nearly 95 examples to
make the reader easily follow the definitions. We have also provided 125
figures for help in easily understanding the definition and examples. We have
also given 25 real world problems as applications of Bimatrices to Fuzzy and
Neutrosophic models.

variable as a function of the proper time of the particles. The equations of

solved. A conservation law for the drift momentum of the particle during its

numerical simulations reveal that photon creation in a three-dimensional

of TE-mode photons in the lowest frequency mode $(1,1,1)$ is most efficient in
a non-cubic cavity where the size of the non-dynamical dimensions is roughly 11
