constrain the interactions between the neutrinos and the dark energy scalar
fields. In the analysis we take the dark energy scalars to be either
Quintessence-like or Phantom-like. Our results show the data mildly favor a
model where the neutrinos couple to a phantom-like dark energy scalar, which
implies the equation of state of the coupled system behaves like Quintom
scenario in the sense of parameter degeneracy. We find future observations like
SNAP are potentially promising to measure the couplings between neutrino and
dark energy.

afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large number
of cases. This is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previously
discovered in some GRBs (e.g. GRB 990123 and GRB 021211). Comparisons of the
X-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluence
is used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases X-ray,
light at these early epochs. This comparison reveals that some of these bursts
appear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. We discuss possible
mechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of early
optical emission. The mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,
circumburst absorption, Ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to high
redshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsic
weakness of the reverse shock. Of these, foreground extinction, circumburst
absorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of the
non-detections in our sample. There is tentative evidence of suppression of the
strong reverse shock emission. This could be because of a
Poynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverse
shock.

  Publications Series",,"10.1051/eas:2006099",,"astro-ph",,"  We analyze the mass accretion histories (MAHs) and density profiles of
cluster-size halos in a flat LCDM cosmology.To fit the MAHs of all systems we
need to generalize the MAH fit found in previous systematic studies of
predominantly galactic halos.We find that the concentration of the density
distribution is tightly correlated with the halo MAH and its formation
redshift. During the early period of fast mass growth the concentration remains
roughly constant and low (~3-4), while during the slow accretion phase it
increases with decreasing redshift as 1/(1+z).We consider fits of three widely
discussed analytic density profiles.We find that there is no unique best fit
for all clusters.At the same time, if a cluster is best fit by a particular
analytic profile at z=0, the same is usually true at earlier epochs out to z ~
1-2.The local logarithmic slope of the density profiles at 3% of the virial
radius ranges from -1.2 to -2.0.In addition, the logarithmic slope becomes
shallower with decreasing radius without reaching an asymptotic value down to
the smallest resolved scale (<1% of the virial radius).During the early MAH
period of rapid mass growth the density profiles can be well described by a
single power law rho(r) ~ r^-a with a ~ 1.5-2.The relatively shallow power law
slopes result in low concentrations at these stages of evolution, as the scale
radius where the density profiles reaches the slope of -2 is at large
radii.This indicates that the inner power law like density distribution of
halos is built up during the periods of rapid mass accretion and active
merging, while the outer steeper profile is formed when the mass accretion
slows down.

transverse widths that are 1.3 times their extent from the center, their
surface brightness is the lowest among known giant radio sources and the lobes
have relatively steep radio spectra. We infer that these wide lobes were
created as a result of a highly variable and intermittent jet whose axis
direction also varied significantly: the Fat-Double lobes in this giant radio
source are a result of the ejection and deposition of synchrotron plasma over a
wide range of angles over time rather than the expansion of relic lobes.
Additionally, the optical host shows evidence for an ongoing galaxy-galaxy
interaction. SGRS J0515-8100 supports the hypothesis that interactions with
companions might perturb the inner accretion disk that produces and sustains
the jets at the centers of active galactic nuclei. As a result, it appears
unnecessary to invoke black-hole coalescence to explain such morphologies,

detectors may be overestimates.

composite or fluffy. However, the computation of the optical properties of such
particles is still a very difficult problem. We analyze how the increase of
grain porosity influences basic features of cosmic dust -- interstellar
extinction, dust temperature, infrared bands and millimeter opacity. Porous
grains can reproduce the flat extinction across the $3 - 8 \mkm$ wavelength
range measured for several lines of sight by {\it ISO} and {\it Spitzer}.
  Porous grains are generally cooler than compact grains. At the same time, the
temperature of very porous grains becomes slightly larger in the case of the
EMT-Mie calculations in comparison with the results found from the
layered-sphere model. The layered-sphere model predicts a broadening of
infrared bands and a shift of the peak position to larger wavelengths as
porosity grows. In the case of the EMT-Mie model variations of the feature
profile are less significant. It is also shown that the millimeter mass
absorption coefficients grow as porosity increases with a faster growth
occurring for particles with Rayleigh/non-Rayleigh inclusions. As a result, for
very porous particles the coefficients given by two models can differ by a
factor of about 3.
  It is found that an increase of porosity leads to an increase of extinction
cross sections at some wavelengths and a decrease at others depending on the
grain model. However, this behaviour is sufficient to reproduce the extinction
curve in the direction of the star $\sigma$ Sco using current solar abundances.
In the case of the star $\zeta$ Oph our model requires larger amounts of carbon
and iron in the dust-phase than is available.

imperceptible indentation, allowing it to neck at the center. The dynamics are
explored systematically by varying both the straining capability of the STZs

the plastic flow and result in sharper necks. Decreased values of the external
strain rate result in the formation of narrow shear bands, consistent with the

rate, the results show trends similar to those in the necking simulations. The
pre-annealing was modeled by using a low initial density of STZs. This had most
effect when epsilon_0 was large, contributing to the localization of the strain

on a relation to their classical counterparts. Explicitly, we show that
whenever chessboard estimates can be used to prove a phase transition in the
classical model, the corresponding quantum model will have a similar phase
transition, provided the inverse temperature $\beta$ and the magnitude of the
quantum spins $\CalS$ satisfy $\beta\ll\sqrt\CalS$. From the quantum system we
require that it is reflection positive and that it has a meaningful classical
limit; the core technical estimate may be described as an extension of the
Berezin-Lieb inequalities down to the level of matrix elements. The general
theory is applied to prove phase transitions in various quantum spin systems
with $\CalS\gg1$. The most notable examples are the quantum orbital-compass
model on $\Z^2$ and the quantum 120-degree model on $\Z^3$ which are shown to
exhibit symmetry breaking at low-temperatures despite the infinite degeneracy
of their (classical) ground state.

enables the realization of braiding mappings on commutative algebras. The aim
of the article is to perform this task explicitly, leading us to formulae for
so-called braided products.

antisymmetric valence-2 tensor are derived in four-dimensional spacetime. In
addition these bilinear concomitants are symmetric (or antisymmetric),
self-dual (or anti-self-dual), and hermitian forms in the antisymmetric tensor.
An important example of an antisymmetric valence-2 tensor, or bivector, is the
electromagnetic field strength tensor which ordinarily is taken to be
real-valued. In generalizing to complex-valued bivectors, the authors find the
hermitian form versions of the well-known electromagnetic scalar invariants and
stress-energy-momentum tensor, but also discover several novel tensors of total
valence 2 and 4. These tensors have algebraic similarities to the Riemann,
Weyl, and Ricci tensors.

connected closed manifold M is topological rigid in the following sense. If f:
N --> M is an orientation preserving homotopy equivalence with a closed
oriented manifold as target, then there is an orientation preserving
homeomorphism h: N --> M such that h and f induce up to conjugation the same
maps on the fundamental groups. We call such manifolds Borel manifolds. We give
partial answers to this questions for S^k x S^d, for sphere bundles over
aspherical closed manifolds of dimension less or equal to 3 and for 3-manifolds
with torsionfree fundamental groups. We show that this rigidity is inherited
under connected sums in dimensions greater or equal to 5. We also classify
manifolds of dimension 5 or 6 whose fundamental group is the one of a surface
and whose second homotopy group is trivial.

single photon sources, linear optical elements and photon-number resolving
detectors. These gates are heralded but operate with probabilities much less
than one. There is currently a large gap between the performance of the known
circuits and the established upper bounds on their success probabilities. One
possibility for increasing the probability of success of such gates is
feed-forward, where one attempts to correct certain failure events that
occurred in the gate's operation. In this brief report we examine the role of
feed-forward in improving the success probability. In particular, for the
non-linear sign shift gate, we find that in a three-mode implementation with a
single round of feed-forward the optimal average probability of success is
approximately given by p= 0.272. This value is only slightly larger than the
general optimal success probability without feed-forward, P= 0.25.
