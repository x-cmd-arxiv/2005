been essentially unknown. It usually cannot be observed directly, due to the
strong hot dust emission which dominates quasar spectra longward of ~1micron.
However this is quite an important part of the spectrum theoretically. At least
bare disk models provide quite a robust prediction for the overall continuum
shape in the near-infrared. Self-gravity should become important in the outer,
near-infrared emitting regions of the putative disk, possibly leaving a
signature of disk truncation in the near-infrared. We propose here that this
important part of the spectrum can be revealed for the first time by observing
polarized flux from normal quasars. At least in some polarized quasars, the
emission lines are all unpolarized and so the polarized flux should originate
interior to the broad line region, and therefore also interior to the dust
emitting region. This can then be used to eliminate the dust emission. We
present the results of near-infrared polarimetry for such three quasars
(Ton202, 4C37.43, B2 1208+32). The data for Ton202 have the highest S/N, and
the near-infrared polarized flux in this case is measured to have quite a blue
shape, nu^+0.42+-0.29 in F_nu, intriguingly consistent with the simple
multi-temperature black body, bare disk prediction of nu^+1/3. All these data,
although still with quite low S/N for the other two objects, demonstrate the
unique potential of the technique with future better data. We also present
similar data for other quasars and radio galaxies, and briefly discuss the
nature of the polarization.

a decrease in the ionization state of a highly-ionized absorber in a similar
way as was done for 4U 1323-62. This implies that the complex spectral changes
in the X-ray continua observed from the dip sources as a class can be most
simply explained primarily by changes in the highly ionized absorbers present
in these systems. There is no need to invoke unusual abundances or partial
covering of extended emission regions. Outside of the dips, the absorption line
properties do not vary strongly with orbital phase. This implies that the
ionized plasma has a cylindrical geometry with a maximum column density close
to the plane of the accretion disk. Since dipping sources are simply normal
LMXBs viewed from close to the orbital plane this implies that ionized plasmas
are a common feature of LMXBs.

that slow-mode shocks propagate along these reconnected flux tubes, releasing
magnetic energy as in steady-state Petschek reconnection. The geometry of these
three-dimensional shocks, however, differs dramatically from the classical
two-dimensional geometry. They propagate along the flux tube legs in four
isolated fronts, whereas in the two-dimensional Petschek model, they form a

flux tubes would then settle into equilibrium in the low corona, forming an

the outflow in which the low velocity component is a highly ionized, high

broad emission line region, although due to measurable columns of N V and C IV,
we assign it a somewhat smaller ionization parameter than found previously,

known wavelengths into the same cloud surfaces. We identify photons with
wavelengths shortward of 118 nm as the source of ERE initiation, not to be
confused with ERE excitation, however. There are strong indications from the
well-studied ERE in the Red Rectangle nebula and in the high-|b| Galactic
cirrus that the photon flux with wavelengths shortward of 118 nm is too small
to actually excite the observed ERE, even with 100% quantum efficiency. We
conclude, therefore, that ERE excitation results from a two-step process. While
none of the previously proposed ERE models can match these new constraints, we
note that under interstellar conditions most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
(PAH) molecules are ionized to the di-cation stage by photons with E > 10.5 eV

challenge in accretion disk theory. Turbulence provides a natural means of
dissipation and the removal of angular momentum, but firmly establishing its
presence in disks proved for many years to be difficult. The realization in the
1990s that a weak magnetic field will destabilize a disk and result in a
vigorous turbulent transport of angular momentum has revolutionized the field.
Much of accretion disk research now focuses on understanding the implications
of this mechanism for astrophysical observations. At the same time, the success
of this mechanism depends upon a sufficient ionization level in the disk for
the flow to be well-coupled to the magnetic field. Many disks, such as disks
around young stars and disks in binary systems that are in quiescence, are too
cold to be sufficiently ionized, and so efforts to establish the presence of
turbulence in these disks continues.
  This dissertation focuses on several possible mechanisms for the turbulent
transport of angular momentum in weakly-ionized accretion disks: gravitational
instability, radial convection and vortices driving compressive motions. It
appears that none of these mechanisms are very robust in driving accretion. A
discussion is given, based on these results, as to the most promising
directions to take in the search for a turbulent transport mechanism that does
not require magnetic fields. Also discussed are the implications of assuming
that no turbulent transport mechanism exists for weakly-ionized disks.

calculated and included in the simulations to take account of additional
angular momentum losses beyond that associated with gravitational radiation and
mass loss, due to nova outbursts, from the system. As a specific example, we
consider the effect of a circumbinary disk to gain insight into the ingredients
necessary to reproduce the observed orbital period distribution. The resulting
distributions show that the period minimum lies at about 80 minutes with the
number of systems monotonically increasing with increasing orbital period to a
maximum near 90 minutes. There is no evidence for an accumulation of systems at
the period minimum which is a common feature of simulations in which only
gravitational radiation losses are considered. The period distribution is found
to be fairly flat for orbital periods ranging from about 85 to 120 minutes. The
steepness of the lower edge of the period gap can be reproduced, for example,
by an input of systems at periods near 2.25 hrs due to a flow of cataclysmic
variable binary systems from orbital periods longer than 2.75 hrs. The good
agreement with the cumulated distribution function of observed systems within
the framework of our model indicates that the angular momentum loss by a
circumbinary disk or a mechanism which mimics its features coupled with a
weighting factor to account for selection effects in the discovery of such

2 AGN, have Seyfert-like X-ray luminosities (i.e., L_X ~ 10^{43-44} ergs

peak in the cosmic star-formation rate, this paper proposes that the obscuring
material required for AGN unification is regulated by star-formation within the
host galaxy. We test this idea by computing CXRB synthesis models with a ratio
of Type 2/Type 1 AGN that is a function of both z and 2-10 keV X-ray

parameterization which simultaneously best accounts for Barger's data, the CXRB

of 4, and predicts a Type 2 AGN fraction which evolves as (1+z)^{0.3}. Models

fractions. This particular evolution predicts a Type 2/Type 1 ratio of 1-2 for
log L_X > 44, and thus the deep X-ray surveys are missing about half the
obscured AGN with these luminosities. These objects are likely to be Compton
thick. Overall, these calculations show that the current data strongly supports
a change to the AGN unification scenario where the obscuration is connected
with star formation in the host galaxy rather than a molecular torus alone. The
evolution of the obscuration implies a close relationship between star
formation and AGN fueling, most likely due to minor mergers or interactions.

Continuous, periodic wave solutions exist when radiative diffusion is slow

these wave trains should develop spontaneously. The buoyancy-driven waves are
physically distinct from photon bubbles in the presence of rapid diffusion,
which evolve into trains of gas pressure-dominated shocks as they become
nonlinear.
  Like the gas pressure-driven shock trains, buoyancy-driven photon bubbles can
exhibit very large density contrasts, which greatly enhance the flow of
radiation through the atmosphere. However, steady-state solutions for
buoyancy-driven photon bubbles exist only when an extra source of radiation is
added to the energy equation, in the form of a flux divergence. We argue that
this term is required to compensate for the radiation flux lost via the
bubbles, which increases with height. We speculate that an atmosphere subject
to buoyancy-driven photon bubbles, but lacking this compensating energy source,
would lose pressure support and collapse on a timescale much shorter than the
radiative diffusion time in the equivalent homogeneous atmosphere.

rms^2-M_BH correlation with the aim of constraining AGN masses based on X-ray
variability. A viable approach to addressing this problem is to assume an
underlying power spectral density with a suitable mass dependence, derive the
functional form of the rms^2-M_BH correlation for a given sampling pattern, and
investigate whether the result is consistent with the observations. For
simplicity, previous studies, inspired by the similarities shared by the timing
properties of AGN and X-ray binaries, have explored model power spectral
densities characterized by broken power laws. and ignored, in general, the
distorting effects that the particular sampling pattern imprints in the
observed power spectral density. Motivated by the latest timing results from
X-ray binaries, obtained with RXTE, we propose that AGN broad-band noise
spectra consist of a small number of Lorentzian components. This assumption
allows, for the first time, to fully account for sampling effects in
theoretical models of X-ray variability in an analytic manner. We show that,
neglecting sampling effects when deriving the fractional rms from the model
power spectral density can lead to underestimating it by a factor of up to 80%
with respect to its true value for the typical sampling patterns used to
monitor AGN. We discuss the implications of our results for the derivation of

vectors of individual components in binary systems tend to be parallel to each
other. The amplitude of their polarisations are also correlated. These findings
are in agreement with our previous work and extend the trend to smaller

seem to support the notion of extended star formation taking place in radio

overdense regions harbouring a complexity of dusty and vigorously star forming
systems. At the redshift of the radio galaxies, the 350 micron observations
sample very close to the rest-frame dust peak (typically at ~100 micron), and
they therefore contribute a particularly important point to the spectral energy

in determining just where and how often the supernova ignites. We find that the
overall convective flow is dipolar, with the higher temperature fluctuations in
an outbound flow preferentially on one side of the star. Taken at face value,
this suggests an asymmetric ignition that may well persist in the geometry of
the final explosion. However, we also find that even a moderate amount of
rotation tends to fracture this dipole flow, making ignition over a broader
region more likely. Though our calculations lack the resolution to study the
flow at astrophysically relevant Rayleigh numbers, we also speculate that the
observed dipolar flow will become less organized as the viscosity becomes very
small. Motion within the dipole flow shows evidence of turbulence, suggesting
that only geometrically large fluctuations (~1 km) will persist to ignite the
runaway. We also examine the probability density function for the temperature
fluctuations, finding evidence for a Gaussian, rather than exponential
distribution, which suggests that ignition sparks may be strongly spatially

above the apex of the closed flare loop on their way to the chromosphere. We
call this the ""shock reprocessing"" model. The model reproduces the energy
dependent arrival time delays observed for both the pulsed and smooth
components of impulsive solar flare x-rays with physically reasonable
parameters for the downflow region. The model also predicts an emission site
above the loop-top, as seen in the Masuda flare. The loop-top source
distinguishes the shock reprocessing model from previous models. The model
makes testable predictions for the energy dependence of footpoint pulse
strengths and the location and spectrum of the loop-top emission, and can
account for the observed soft-hard-soft trend in the spectral evolution of
footpoint emission. Our model highlights the concept that reconnection is an
acceleration environment rather than a single process. Which combination of
processes operate may depend on the initial conditions that determine, for
example, whether the reconnection downflow is turbulent. The shock reprocessing
model comprises one such combination.

quiescent}, according to the origin of the stars. The merger component is
formed during major mergers by gas driven to the centre, while the quiescent
component is formed in gaseous discs and added later to the spheroid during
major mergers. Galaxies more massive than $M_C=3 \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$
have on average only a 15% merger component in their spheroids, while smaller
galaxies can have up to 30%. The merger component increases with redshift due
to mergers involving more gas. However we do not find mergers with gas fraction
above $ \sim 40 %$ of the remnants mass. Generally the gas fraction is a
decreasing function of the redshift at which the merger occurs and the mass of
the remnant, with more massive remnants having smaller gas fraction and hence
smaller merger components. This trend is independent of the environment of the
galaxy with the only impact of the environment being that galaxies less massive
than $M_C$ have slightly larger merger components in dense environments.
  The fraction of stars in bulges for galaxies more massive than $M_C$ is
larger than 50%. We find that the majority of stars in galaxies more massive
than $M_C$ reside within bulges and ellipticals independent of redshift and
that the fraction increases with redshift. The most massive galaxies at each
redshift are elliptical galaxies.

fractal aggregates composed of homogeneous spheres. For the compact particles
we consider Gaussian random spheres with various degrees of non-sphericity. For
the fractal aggregates we compute the absorption spectra for various fractal

in random orientation using the well-known Discrete Dipole Approximation. We
compare our results to spectra obtained when using volume equivalent
homogeneous spheres and to those computed using a porous sphere approximation.
We conclude that, in general, nonspherical particles show a spectral signature
that is similar to that of homogeneous spheres with a smaller material volume.
This effect is overestimated when approximating the particles by porous spheres
with the same volume filling fraction. For aggregates with fractal dimensions
typically predicted for cosmic dust, we show that the spectral signature
characteristic of very small homogeneous spheres (with a volume equivalent
radius r_V<0.5 micron) can be detected even in very large particles. We
conclude that particle sizes are underestimated when using homogeneous spheres
to model the emission spectra of astronomical sources. In contrast, the
particle sizes are severely overestimated when using equivalent porous spheres

to heat up before declining and fade as a very hot compact star. In the

young stars is in a too hot phase to be detectable with the optical

Telescope. The gaseous disk of NGC5055 extends out to about 40 kpc, equal to
3.5 R_25, and shows a pronounced warp that starts at the end of the bright
optical disk (R_25= 11.6 kpc). This very extended warp has large-scale
symmetry, which along with the rotation period of its outer parts (~1.5 Gyr at
40 kpc), suggests a long-lived phenomenon. The rotation curve rises steeply in
the central parts up to the maximum velocity (v_max ~ 206 km/s). Beyond the
bright stellar disk (R_25), it shows a decline of about 25 km/s and then
remains flat out to the last measured point. The standard analysis with
luminous and dark matter components shows the dynamical importance of the disk.
The best fit to the rotation curve is obtained with a ``maximum disk''. Less
satisfactory fits with lighter disks help to set a firm lower limit of 1.4 to
the mass-to-light ratio in F band of the disk. Such a ``minimum disk''
contributes about 60% of the observed maximum rotational velocity. NGC5055
shows remarkable overall regularity and symmetry. A mild lopsidedness is
noticeable, however, both in the distribution and kinematics of the gas. The
tilted ring analysis of the velocity field led us to adopt different values for
the kinematical centre and for the systemic velocity for the inner and the
outer parts of the system. This has produced a remarkable result: the
kinematical and geometrical asymmetries disappear, both at the same time. These
results point at two different dynamical regimes: an inner region dominated by
the stellar disk and an outer one, dominated by a dark matter halo offset with
respect to the disk.

We consider the acceleration by large scale compressions in both slow and fast

that arises from resonance scattering and Transit-Time Damping (TTD).
  We establish that fast modes accelerate particles more efficiently than slow
modes. We find that particle acceleration by pitch-angle scattering and TTD
dominates acceleration by slow or fast modes when the spatial diffusion rate is
small. When the rate of spatial diffusion of particles is high, we establish an
enhancement of the efficiency of particle acceleration by slow and fast modes
in weak turbulence. We show that highly supersonic turbulence is an efficient
agent for particle acceleration. We find that even incompressible turbulence
can accelerate particles on the scales comparable with the particle mean free

the ILF-noise correlation time is much longer than the analyzer reciprocal

temperature fluctuations and the defect-motion as mechanisms of $1/f$ noise in

problem to obtain exact results for the mean number of time steps needed for
the reaction to take place as well as for higher order moments. Previous
results obtained in the framework of a difference equation approach are fully
confirmed, including the existence of a parity effect. For even lattices the
maximum efficiency corresponds to a mixture of synchronous events and a small
amount of asynchronous events, while for odd lattices the reaction time is
minimized by a purely synchronous process. We provide an intuitive explanation

The data suggests that the $\sigma$-bands are characterized by a stronger

$\gamma_{imp}$, compared to the $\pi$-bands. The optical response along the
boron planes is marked by an intense interband transition at 2.6 eV, due to
which the reflectivity plasma edges along the a- and c-axes are shifted with

a blueish-silver to the yellow as the polarization is rotated from the in-plane
direction towards the c-axis. The optical spectra are in good agreement with
the published {\it ab initio} calculations. The remaining discrepancies can be
explained by the relative shift of $\sigma$-bands and $\pi$-bands by about 0.2
eV compared to the theoretical band structure, in agreement with the de
Haas-van Alphen experiments. The widths of the Drude and the interband peaks

electron system (2DES) separated by a thin barrier layer from a layer of InAs

magnetoresistance ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistance ($\rho_{xy}$) are
suppressed significantly in the magnetic field range of filling factor $\nu<1$

  Vaxjo, Sweden",,"10.1063/1.2158724",,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  General relativity and quantum mechanics are conflicting theories. The seeds
of discord are the fundamental principles on which these theories are grounded.
General relativity, on one hand, is based on the equivalence principle, whose
strong version establishes the local equivalence between gravitation and
inertia. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is fundamentally based on the
uncertainty principle, which is essentially nonlocal in the sense that a
particle does not follow one trajectory, but infinitely many trajectories, each
one with a different probability. This difference precludes the existence of a
quantum version of the strong equivalence principle, and consequently of a
quantum version of general relativity. Furthermore, there are compelling
experimental evidences that a quantum object in the presence of a gravitational
field violates the weak equivalence principle. Now it so happens that, in
addition to general relativity, gravitation has an alternative, though
equivalent description, given by teleparallel gravity, a gauge theory for the
translation group. In this theory torsion, instead of curvature, is assumed to
represent the gravitational field. These two descriptions lead to the same
classical results, but are conceptually different. In general relativity,
curvature geometrizes the interaction, while torsion in teleparallel gravity
acts as a force, similar to the Lorentz force of electrodynamics. Because of
this peculiar property, teleparallel gravity describes the gravitational
interaction without requiring any of the equivalence principles. The
replacement of general relativity by teleparallel gravity may, in consequence,
lead to a conceptual reconciliation of gravitation with quantum mechanics.

flavor violation (NMFV), is considered. In the NMFV framework, new physics
(NP), which is required for stabilization of the electroweak symmetry breaking
(EWSB) scale, naturally couples (dominantly) to the third generation quarks and
is quasi-aligned with the Yukawa matrices. Consequently, new sources of flavor
and CP violation are present in the theory, mediated by a low scale of few TeV.
However, in spite of the low flavor scale, the most severe bounds on the scale
of NP are evaded since these are related to flavor violation in the first two
generations. Instead, one typically finds that the NP contributions are
comparable in size to SM loop processes. We argue that, in spite of the
successful SM unitary triangle fit and contrary to the common lore, such a
sizable contribution to Delta F=2 processes of ~ 40% (with arbitrary phase)
compared to SM is presently allowed since B-factories are only beginning to
constrain these models. Thus, it is very interesting that in the NMFV models
one is not forced to separate the scale of NP related to EWSB and the scale of
flavor violation. We show briefly that this simple setup includes a wide class
of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models all of which solve the
hierarchy problem. We further discuss tests related to Delta F=1 processes, in
particular the ones related to b -> s transition. The b -> s processes are
computed using two different hadronic models to estimate the uncertainties
involved. In addition, we derive constraints on the NP from B -> Kpi data using
only SU(3) flavor symmetry and minimal dynamical assumptions. Finally we argue
that in many cases correlating Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 processes is a powerful
tool to probe our framework.

an unloaded scintillator the time needed for a useful discrimination between
different geophysical models is too large if one uses the directional

considerably, although a 50 kt detector would still need several decades to
distinguish between a geophysical reference model and one with a large neutrino

exponential inflation that is entirely driven by the quadratic kinetic energy
of a scalar field. In contrast to recent attempts to realize scalar field
inflation without potentials (such as k-inflation or ghost inflation), we find
that it is possible to obtain exponential inflation, without invoking any
higher derivative actions, or modifying gravity, and that unlike all previous
approaches, we do not require a $\rho = -p$ phase in order to realize
inflation. The inflaton in our proposed framework is a scalar field with a
quadratic kinetic energy term, but with the `wrong sign'. We take the
perspective that this is due to some temporary instability in our system at
high energies, and provide physical examples of situations where a modulus
field might temprorarily exhibit such behaviour. The deflation of extra
dimensions is a neccesary feature of our framework. However, unlike in previous
attempts at Kaluza-Klein inflation, it is possible to obtain exponential (as
opposed to power law or pole) inflation. We provide several indications of how
one can gracefully exit from this type of inflation.

generalized sine-Gordon models with nonvanishing mass terms, using the
Wegner-Houghton RG method in the local potential approximation. Particular
emphasis is laid upon the layered sine-Gordon (LSG) model, which is the
bosonized version of the multi-flavour Schwinger model and approaches the sum
of two ``normal'', massless sine-Gordon (SG) models in the limit of a vanishing
interlayer coupling J. Another model of interest is the massive sine-Gordon
(MSG) model. The leading-order approximation to the UV (ultra-violet) RG flow
predicts two phases for the LSG as well as for the MSG, just as it would be
expected for the SG model, where the two phases are known to be separated by
the Coleman fixed point. The presence of finite mass terms (for the LSG and the
MSG) leads to corrections to the UV RG flow, which are naturally identified as
the ``mass corrections''. The leading-order mass corrections are shown to have
the following consequences: (i) for the MSG model, only one phase persists, and
(ii) for the LSG model, the transition temperature is modified. Within the
mass-corrected UV scaling laws, the limit of J -> 0 is thus nonuniform with
respect to the phase structure of the model. The modified phase structure of
general massive sine-Gordon models is connected with the breaking of symmetries
in the internal space spanned by the field variables. For the LSG, the
second-order subleading mass corrections suggest that there exists a cross-over
regime before the IR scaling sets in, and the nonlinear terms show explicitly
that higher-order Fourier modes appear in the periodic blocked potential.

that we can recover the derived category of coherent sheaves on a complex
manifold. In this paper and ones to follow we apply this to stating and proving
the duality statements mentioned above. After developing the general framework,
we look at a (complex) Lie algebroid $\A\to T_\cx X$. One can then consider our
analogue of the derived category of coherent sheaves, integrable with respect
to the Lie algebroid. We then establish a (Serre) duality theorem for
""elliptic"" Lie algebroids and for noncommutative tori.

"math/0509285","Terence Gaffney","Terence Gaffney","The Multiplicity Polar Theorem and Isolated Singularities","22 pages",,,,"math.AG math.AC",,"  Using invariants from commutative algebra to count geometric objects is a
basic idea in singularities. For example, the multiplicity of an ideal is used
to count points of intersection of two analytic sets at points of
non-transverse intersection. A problem with the multiplicity of an ideal or
module is that it is only defined for modules and ideals of finite colength.
  In this paper we use pairs of modules and their multiplicities as a way
around this difficulty. A key tool is the multiplicity-polar theorem which
applies to families of pairs of modules, linking the multiplicity at a general
pair of the family to the multiplicity of the pair at the special fiber.
  The specific problem we work on is:
  Suppose X,0 is an equidimensional complex analytic set in C^n, and T^*_X(C^n)
is the closure of the conormal vectors to the smooth part of X, s, a section of
T^*(C^n), the cotangent bundle of C^n restricted to X. Suppose the intersection
of the image of s, denoted im(s), with T^*_X(C^n) is isolated. Then we
calculate the intersection multiplicity im(s)\cdot T^*_X(C^n) using the
multiplicity of pairs. It is easy to see that if X=C^n and s(x)=df(x), where f
has an isolated singularity at the origin, then this number is the Milnor
number of f.
  Variations of this number appear in several different situations, such as,
the theory of differential forms on singular spaces, the theory of D-modules,
the Milnor fiber of a function with an isolated singularity, the A_f
stratification condition of Thom, and the theory of the Euler invariant. We
discuss the application of our result to all of these situations.

Heisenberg calculus. The Heisenberg manifolds generalize CR and contact
manifolds and in this context the main differential operators at stake include
the H\""ormander's sum of squares, the Kohn Laplacian, the horizontal
sublaplacian and its conformal powers and the contact Laplacian. These
operators cannot be elliptic and the relevant pseudodifferential calculus to
study them is provided by the Heisenberg calculus. The aim of this monograph is
threefold. First, we give an intrinsic approach to the Heisenberg calculus by
finding an intrinsic notion of principal symbol in this setting. This framework
allows us to prove that the pointwise invertibility of a principal symbol,
which can be restated in terms of the so-called Rockland condition, actually
implies its global invertibility. Second, we study complex powers of
hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds in terms of the Heisenberg
calculus. In particular, we show that complex powers of such operators give
rise to holomorphic families in the Heisenberg calculus and we construct a
scale of weighted Sobolev spaces providing us with sharp estimates for the
operators in the Heisenberg calculus. Third, we make use of the Heisenberg
calculus and of the results of this monograph to derive spectral asymptotics
for hypoelliptic operators on Heisenberg manifolds. The advantage of using the
Heisenberg calculus is illustrated by reformulating in a geometric fashion
these asymptotics for the main geometric operators on CR and contact manifolds.

distinct subclasses of geometrically ergodic Markov processes in terms of
inequalities for the nonlinear generator. We concentrate on the class of
""multiplicatively regular"" Markov processes, characterized via conditions
similar to (but weaker than) those of Donsker-Varadhan. For any such process
{Phi(t)} with transition kernel P on a general state space, the following are
obtained. 1. SPECTRAL THEORY: For a large class of functionals F, the kernel
Phat(x,dy) = e^{F(x)}P(x,dy) has a discrete spectrum in an appropriately
defined Banach space. There exists a ""maximal"" solution to the ""multiplicative
Poisson equation,"" defined as the eigenvalue problem for Phat. Regularity
properties are established for \Lambda(F) = \log(\lambda), where \lambda is the
maximal eigenvalue, and for its convex dual. 2. MULTIPLICATIVE MEAN ERGODIC
THEOREM: The normalized mean E_x[\exp(S_t)] of the exponential of the partial
sums {S_t} of the process with respect to any one of the above functionals F,
converges to the maximal eigenfunction. 3. MULTIPLICATIVE REGULARITY: The drift
criterion under which our results are derived is equivalent to the existence of
regeneration times with finite exponential moments for {S_t}. 4. LARGE
DEVIATIONS: The sequence of empirical measures of {Phi(t)} satisfies an LDP in
a topology finer than the \tau-topology. The rate function is \Lambda^* and it
coincides with the Donsker-Varadhan rate function. 5. EXACTR LARGE DEVIATIONS:
The partial sums {S_t} satisfy an exact LD expansion, analogous to that
obtained for independent random variables.

The basic principles of ultrasonic methods are now well established for varying
isotropic media, particularly in the field of biomedical engineering. However,
little progress has been made in its application to anisotropic materials. This
is largely due to the complex nature of wave propagation in these media. In the
present study, the theory of elastic waves is essential because it relates the
elastic moduli of a material to the velocity of propagation of these waves
along arbitrary directions in a solid. Transducers are generally placed in
contact with the samples which are often cubes with parallel faces that are
difficult to prepare. The ultrasonic method used here is original, a rough
preparation of the bone is sufficient and the sample is in rotation. Moreover,
to analyze heterogeneity of the structure we measure velocities in different
points on the sample. The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro
the anisotropic elastic properties of cortical bones. For this purpose, our
method allowed measuring longitudinal and transversal velocities (CL and CT) in
longitudinal (fiber direction) and radial directions (orthogonal to the fiber
direction) of compact bones. Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio &#61550;,
were then deduced from the velocities measured considering the compact bone as
transversely isotropic or orthotropic. The results are in line with those of
other methods.

have yet studied the tensile behaviour of compact bone including failure under
dynamic loadings (1m/s). The originality of this study comes from not only the
analysis of compact bone failure under dynamic loadings, the results of which
are compared to those obtained under quasi static loadings but also the
development of a statistical model. We developed a protocol using three
different devices. Firstly, an X-ray scanner to analyse bone density, secondly,
a common tensile device to perform quasi static experiments and thirdly, a
special device based upon a hydraulic cylinder to perform dynamic tests. For
all the tests, we used the same sample shape which took into account the
brittleness of the compact bone. We first performed relaxation and hysteresis
tests followed by tensile tests up to failure. Viscous and plastic effects were
not relevant to the compact bone behaviour so its behaviour was considered
elastic and brittle. The bovine compact bone was three to four times more
brittle under a dynamic load than under a quasi static one. Numerically, a
statistical model, based upon the Weibull theory is used to predict the failure
stress in compact bone.

for the dependence of the diffusion coefficient, D, and the kinetic factor, K,

Rev. Lett. 94 (2005), 184506; physics/0411050) it
was shown that a simple mean-field dynamo model with a spherically symmetric
helical turbulence parameter alpha can exhibit a number of features which are
typical for Earth's magnetic field reversals. In particular, the model produces
asymmetric reversals, a positive correlation of field strength and interval
length, and a bimodal field distribution. All these features are attributable
to the magnetic field dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional point of the
spectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator. The negative slope of the
growth rate curve between the nearby local maximum and the exceptional point
makes the system unstable and drives it to the exceptional point and beyond
into the oscillatory branch where the sign change happens. A weakness of this
reversal model is the apparent necessity to fine-tune the magnetic Reynolds
number and/or the radial profile of alpha. In the present paper, it is shown
that this fine-tuning is not necessary in the case of higher supercriticality
of the dynamo. Numerical examples and physical arguments are compiled to show
that, with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, there is strong tendency for
the exceptional point and the associated local maximum to move close to the
zero growth rate line. Although exemplified again by the spherically symmetric
alpha^2 dynamo model, the main idea of this ''self-tuning'' mechanism of
saturated dynamos into a reversal-prone state seems well transferable to other
dynamos. As a consequence, reversing dynamos might be much more typical and may
occur much more frequently in nature than what could be expected from a purely
kinematic perspective.

  Einstein's criticism of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is
an important part of his legacy. Although most physicists consider Einstein's
criticism technically unfounded, we show that the Copenhagen interpretation is
actually incorrect, since Born's probability explanation of the wave function
is incorrect due to a false assumption on ""continuous probabilities"" in modern
probability theory. ""Continuous probability"" means a ""probability measure"" that
can take every value in a subinterval of the unit interval (0, 1). We prove
that such ""continuous probabilities"" are invalid. Since Bell's inequality also
assumes ""continuous probabilities"", the result of the experimental test of
Bell's inequality is not evidence supporting the Copenhagen interpretation.
Although successful applications of quantum mechanics and explanation of
quantum phenomena do not necessarily rely on the Copenhagen interpretation, the
question asked by Einstein 70 years ago, i.e., whether a complete description
of reality exists, still remains open.

AlphaEta [2], claiming that these attacks undermine the security of AlphaEta
for both direct encryption and key generation. In this paper, we show that
their arguments fail in many different ways. In particular, the first attack in
[1] requires channel loss or length of known-plaintext that is exponential in
the key length and is unrealistic even for moderate key lengths. The second
attack is a Grover search attack based on `asymptotic orthogonality' and was
not analyzed quantitatively in [1]. We explain why it is not logically possible
to ``pull back'' an argument valid only at n=infinity into a limit statement,
let alone one valid for a finite number of transmissions n. We illustrate this
by a `proof' using a similar asymptotic orthogonality argument that
coherent-state BB84 is insecure for any value of loss. Even if a limit
statement is true, this attack is a priori irrelevant as it requires an
indefinitely large amount of known-plaintext, resources and processing. We also
explain why the attacks in [1] on AlphaEta as a key-generation system are based
on misinterpretations of [2]. Some misunderstandings in [1] regarding certain
issues in cryptography and optical communications are also pointed out. Short
of providing a security proof for AlphaEta, we provide a description of
