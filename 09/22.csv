of the galaxies. Some of our models match the observed structure of the two
galaxies remarkably well. Our analysis shows that the rotation curves of these
two galaxies are instead quite compatible with their DM halos having steep
cuspy density profiles. The rotation curves in our models are measured using
standard observational techniques. The models reproduce the rotation curves of
both galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile of
isophotal ellipticity and position angle. The models are centrally dominated by
baryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. The simulated
disk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio in
agreement with the observed colors. We show that non-circular motions combined
with gas pressure support and projection effects results in a large
underestimation of the circular velocity in the central $\sim 1$ kpc region,
creating the illusion of a constant density core. Although the systematic

the finite time over which a galaxy sinks to the center of the cluster and
merges with the the central galaxy. The simplest measurable statistic to
quantify the dynamical age of a system of galaxies is the luminosity
(magnitude) gap, which is the difference in photometric magnitude between the
two most luminous galaxies. We present a simple analytical estimate of the
luminosity gap distribution in groups and clusters as a function of dark matter
halo mass. The luminosity gap is used to define ""fossil"" groups; we expect the
fraction of fossil systems to exhibit a strong and model-independent trend with
mass: ~1-3% of massive clusters and ~5-40% of groups should be fossil systems.
We also show that, on cluster scales, the observed intrinsic scatter in the
central galaxy luminosity-halo mass relation can be ascribed to dispersion in
the merger histories of satellites within the cluster. We compare our
predictions to the luminosity gap distribution in a sample of 730 clusters in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey C4 Catalog and find good agreement. This suggests
that theoretical excursion set merger probabilities and the standard theory of

unknown systematic error in the virial energy estimate, and an origin
dependence of the result. We present a method for estimating the systematic
error by assuming that magnetic forces are confined to a thin layer near the
photosphere. If vector magnetic field measurements are available at two levels
in the low atmosphere (e.g. the photosphere and the chromosphere), the
systematic error may be directly calculated using the observed horizontal and
vertical field gradients, resulting in an energy estimate which is independent
of the choice of origin. If (as is generally the case) measurements are
available at only one level, the systematic error may be approximated using the
observed horizontal field gradients together with a simple linear force-free
model for the vertical field gradients. The resulting `improved' virial energy
estimate is independent of the choice of origin, but depends on the choice of
the model for the vertical field gradients, i.e. the value of the linear
force-free parameter $\alpha$. This procedure is demonstrated for five vector

M_star^0.17 and [Fe/H]_MR ~ L^0.26 ~ M_star^0.22, respectively. Although these
relations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by wind
models and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to the
mass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. The
offset between the two GC populations varies slowly (~ M_star^0.05) and is
approximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting a
nearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the two
populations of GCs. We also find that although the metal-rich GCs show a larger
dispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor GCs* that have an equal or larger
dispersion in metallicity. Like the color-magnitude relation, these relations
derived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formation
and evolution of early-type galaxies. (Abridged)

characterize the star-formation history of the early universe, perhaps back to

the reported spectroscopic redshift (6.29 +/- 0.01). Furthermore, just redward
of Ly-alpha the flux is suppressed by a factor of three on the first night, but
returns to expected levels by the fourth night. We propose that this is due to
absorption by molecular hydrogen that was excited to rovibrational states by
the GRB's prompt emission, but was then overtaken by the jet. Now that very
high redshift GRBs have been shown to exist, and at least in this case the
afterglow was very bright, observing programs that are designed to capitalize
on this science will likely drive a new era of study of the early universe,
using GRBs as probes.

on the method, the classical Be star zeta Tau, known to display line
polarization changes at optical wavelengths, was observed as well. Three of our
targets show a ``line effect'' across Pa beta. For zeta Tau and MWC 349A this
line effect is due to depolarisation by a circumstellar electron-scattering
disk. In both cases, the position angle of the polarisation is consistent with
that of the larger scale disks imaged at other wavelengths, validating infrared
spectropolarimetry as a means to detect flattening on small scales. The
tentative detection of a rotation in the polarization position angle at Pa beta
in the embedded massive young stellar object GL 490 suggests the presence of a
small scale rotating accretion disk with an inner hole - similar to those
recently discovered at optical wavelengths in Herbig Ae and T Tauri stars.

object RNO~15-FIR. Towards Serpens SMM1, the most luminous sub-mm source of the
Serpens cluster, the water maser emission comes from two small (< 5 AU in size)
clusters of features separated by ~25 AU, having line of sight velocities
strongly red-shifted (by more than 10 km/s) with respect to the LSR velocity of
the molecular cloud. The two maser clusters are oriented on the sky along a
direction that is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the radio
continuum jet observed with the VLA towards SMM1. The spatial and velocity
distribution of the maser features lead us to favor the interpretation that the
maser emission is excited by interaction of the receding lobe of the jet with
dense gas in the accretion disk surrounding the YSO in SMM1. Towards
RNO~15-FIR, the few detected maser features have both positions and (absolute)
velocities aligned along a direction that is parallel to the axis of the
molecular outflow observed on much larger angular scales. In this case the
maser emission likely emerges from dense, shocked molecular clumps displaced
along the axis of the jet emerging from the YSO. The protostar in Serpens SMM1
is more massive than the one in RNO~15-FIR. We discuss the case where a high
mass ejection rate can generate jets sufficiently powerful to sweep away from
their course the densest portions of circumstellar gas. In this case, the
excitation conditions for water masers might preferably occur at the interface
between the jet and the accretion disk, rather than along the jet axis.

strengthened by suppressing residual gas infall and star formation for galaxies

the generation of high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in
accretion disks around neutron star, black hole, and white dwarf binaries. The
model is inspired by the general idea of a resonance mechanism in the accretion
disk oscillations as was already pointed out by Abramowicz & Klu{\'z}niak
(\cite{Abramowicz2001}). In a first paper (P\'etri \cite{Petri2005a}, paper I),
we showed that a rotating misaligned magnetic field of a neutron star gives
rise to some resonances close to the inner edge of the accretion disk. In this
second paper, we suggest that this process does also exist for an asymmetry in
the gravitational potential of the compact object. We prove that the same
physics applies, at least in the linear stage of the response to the
disturbance in the system. This kind of asymmetry is well suited for neutron
stars or white dwarfs possessing an inhomogeneous interior allowing for a
deviation from a perfectly spherically symmetric gravitational field. We show
by a linear analysis that the disk initially in a cylindrically symmetric
stationary state is subject to three kinds of resonances: a corotation
resonance, a Lindblad resonance due to a driven force and a parametric sonance.
The highest kHz QPOs are then interpreted as the orbital frequency of the disk
at locations where the response to the resonances are maximal. It is also found
that strong gravity is not required to excite the resonances.

method are presented for four bright Galactic objects. Stellar parameters are
derived from spectroscopic indicators. The internal accuracy of the method
allows the 1sigma-uncertainties to be reduced to <1-2% in Teff and to
0.05-0.10dex in log g. Elemental abundances are determined for over 20 chemical
species, with many of the astrophysically most interesting in NLTE. The NLTE
computations reduce random errors and remove systematic trends in the analysis.
Inappropriate LTE analyses tend to systematically underestimate iron group
abundances and overestimate the light and alpha-process element abundances by
up to factors of 2-3 on the mean. Contrary to common assumptions, significant
NLTE abundance corrections of ~0.3dex can be found even for the weakest lines.
NLTE abundance uncertainties amount to typically 0.05-0.10dex (random) and
\~0.10dex (systematic 1sigma-errors). Near-solar abundances are derived for the
heavier elements, and patterns indicative of mixing with nuclear-processed
matter for the light elements. These imply a blue-loop scenario for Eta Leo,
while the other three objects appear to have evolved directly from the main
sequence. In the most ambitious computations several ten-thousand spectral
lines are accounted for, permitting the accurate reproduction of the entire

a small atmospheric window that opens up at this wavelength under very dry

using the sky-dipping method and a relation was established between the optical

extended error-beam detected at roughly two-thirds of the magnitude of the main

chemical evolution, the majority of this sample have an effective yield ~1/4 of
the expected yield for a constant star formation rate and Salpeter IMF,
indicating that either outflow of enriched gas or inflow of pristine gas has
occurred. The effective yield strongly correlates with M_H/L_B in the sense
that gas-rich galaxies are more likely to be closed systems. However, the
effective yield does not appear to correlate with other global parameters such
as dynamical mass, absolute magnitude, star formation rate or surface
brightness. A correlation is found between the observed nitrogen-to-oxygen
ratio and the color of the underlying stellar population; redder dwarf
irregular galaxies have higher N/O ratios than blue dwarf irregular galaxies.

in the extranuclear regions of these galaxies (~5-15 kpc) are typical of LINERs
as obtained from the Veilleux-Osterbrock line ratio diagnostic diagrams. The
range of observed line ratios is best explained by the presence of fast shocks
with velocities of 150 to 500 km s^{-1}, while the ionization by an AGN or
nuclear starburst is in general less likely. The comparison of the
two-dimensional ionization level and velocity dispersion in the extranuclear
regions of these galaxies shows a positive correlation, further supporting the
idea that shocks are indeed the main cause of ionization.
  The origin of these shocks is also investigated. Despite the likely presence
of superwinds in the circumnuclear regions of these systems, no evidence for
signatures of superwinds such as double velocity components are found in the
extended extranuclear regions. We consider a more likely explanation for the

models on a sphere to one-dimensional (1d) models on a circle is adressed. A
possible application is to look at a relation between the 2d anyon model and
the 1d Calogero-Sutherland model, which would allow for a better understanding
of the connection between 2d anyon exchange statistics and Haldane exclusion
statistics. The latter is realized microscopically in the 2d LLL anyon model
and in the 1d Calogero model. In a harmonic well of strength \omega or on a
circle of radius R - both parameters \omega and R have to be viewed as long
distance regulators - the Calogero spectrum is discrete. It is well known that
by confining the anyon model in a 2d harmonic well and projecting it on a
particular basis of the harmonic well eigenstates, one obtains the
Calogero-Moser model. It is then natural to consider the anyon model on a
sphere of radius R and look for a possible dimensional reduction to the
Calogero-Sutherland model on a circle of the same radius. First, the free
one-body case is considered, where a mapping from the 2d sphere to the 1d
chiral circle is established by projection on a special class of spherical
harmonics. Second, the N-body interacting anyon model is considered : it

software architectures. This approach addresses cross-platform interoperability
and quality of service; the model-driven paradigm is applied to a formal
architecture-centric engineering method in order to benefit from the formal
semantic description power in addition to model-based transformations. The
result of such a novel combined concept promotes the re-use of design models
and eases developments in Grid computing by providing an adapted development

  Monodromy Breakup Algorithm","15 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.NA math.AG",,"  We consider the numerical irreducible decomposition of a positive dimensional
solution set of a polynomial system into irreducible factors. Path tracking
techniques computing loops around singularities connect points on the same
irreducible components. The computation of a linear trace for each factor
certifies the decomposition. This factorization method exhibits a good
practical performance on solution sets of relative high degrees.
  Using the same concepts of monodromy and linear trace, we present a new
monodromy breakup algorithm. It shows a better performance than the old method
which requires construction of permutations of witness points in order to break
up the solution set. In contrast, the new algorithm assumes a finer approach
allowing us to avoid tracking unnecessary homotopy paths.
  As we designed the serial algorithm keeping in mind distributed computing, an
additional advantage is that its parallel version can be easily built.
Synchronization issues resulted in a performance loss of the straightforward
parallel version of the old algorithm. Our parallel implementation of the new
approach bypasses these issues, therefore, exhibiting a better performance,
especially on solution sets of larger degree.

over bandwidth if they use duty cycle. Channel uncertainty limits the
achievable data rates of power constrained wide band systems; Duty cycle
transmission reduces the channel uncertainty because the receiver has to
estimate the channel only when transmission takes place. The optimal choice of
the fraction of time used for transmission depends on the spectral efficiency
of the signal modulation. The general principle is demonstrated by comparing
the channel conditions that allow different modulations to achieve the capacity
in the limit. Direct sequence spread spectrum and pulse position modulation
systems with duty cycle achieve the channel capacity, if the increase of the
number of channel paths with the bandwidth is not too rapid. The higher
spectral efficiency of the spread spectrum modulation lets it achieve the
channel capacity in the limit, in environments where pulse position modulation
with non-vanishing symbol time cannot be used because of the large number of
channel paths.

asymptotically flat vacuum space-times to asymptotically flat solutions of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations. Once again, in this case, we get a class of
asymptotically shear-free null geodesic congruences depending on a complex
world-line in the same four-dimensional complex space. However in this case
there will be, in general, two distinct but uniquely chosen world-lines. One of
which can be assigned as the complex center-of- charge while the other could be
called the complex center of mass. Rather than investigating the situation
where there are two distinct complex world-lines, we study instead the special
degenerate case where the two world-lines coincide, i.e., where there is a
single unique world-line. This mimics the case of algebraically special
Einstein-Maxwell fields where the degenerate principle null vector of the Weyl
tensor coincides with a Maxwell principle null vector. Again we obtain
equations of motion for this world-line - but explicitly found here only in an
approximation. Though there are ambiguities in assigning physical meaning to
different terms it appears as if reliance on the Kerr and charged Kerr metrics
and classical electromagnetic radiation theory helps considerably in this
identification. In addition, the resulting equations of motion appear to have
many of the properties of a particle with intrinsic spin and an intrinsic
magnetic dipole moment. At first order there is even the classical
radiation-reaction term 2/3{q^{2}}{c^{-3}}ddot{v}, now obtained without any use
of the Lorentz force law but obtained directly from the asymptotic fields
themselves. One even sees the possible suppression, via the Bondi mass loss, of
the classical runaway solutions due to the radiation reaction force.

contains a D1-brane which looks like a semi-infinite hairpin. In addition to
its curved shape, this ``hairpin brane'' has a condensate of the open string
tachyon stretched between its two sides. The tachyon smears the brane and
shifts the location of its tip. The Minkowski continuation of the hairpin brane
describes a D0-brane freely falling in a linear dilaton background. Effects
that in Euclidean space are attributed to the tachyon condensate, give rise in
the Minkowski case to a stringy smearing of the trajectory of the D-brane by an
amount that grows as its acceleration increases. When the Unruh temperature of
the brane reaches the Hagedorn temperature of perturbative string theory in the
throat, the rolling D-brane state becomes non-normalizable. We propose that
black holes in string theory exhibit similar properties. The Euclidean black
hole solution has a condensate of a tachyon winding around Euclidean time. The
Minkowski manifestation of this condensate is a smearing of the geometry in a
layer around the horizon. As the Hawking temperature, T_{bh}, increases, the
width of this layer grows. When T_{bh} reaches the Hagedorn temperature, the
size of this ``smeared horizon'' diverges, and the black hole becomes
non-normalizable. This provides a new point of view on the string/black hole
transition.

consists in the following: Dirac symbols with octonion matrix elements can be
used to describe states of the space of internal degrees of freedom if and only
if the space corresponds either to stable vacuum states or states close to the

of fixed points is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the manifold, up to
dividing the degrees by two. Examples include complex projective spaces and
Grassmannians with the standard antiholomorphic involution (with real
projective spaces and Grassmannians as fixed point sets).
  Hausmann, Holm and Puppe have put this observation in the framework of
equivariant cohomology, and come up with the concept of ""conjugation spaces"",
where the ring homomorphisms arise naturally from the existence of what they
call ""cohomology frames"". Much earlier, Borel and Haefliger had studied the
degree-halving isomorphism between the cohomology rings of complex and real
projective spaces and Grassmannians using the theory of complex and real
analytic cycles and cycle maps into cohomology.
  The main result in the present note gives a (purely topological) connection
between these two results and provides a geometric intuition between the
concept of a cohomology frame. In particular, we see that if every cohomology
class on a manifold X with involution is the Thom class of an equivariant
topological cycle of codimension twice the codimension of its fixed points
(inside the fixed point set of X), these topological cycles will give rise to a
cohomology frame.

asset price process $ S=(S_{t})_{t\geq0} $ is given by \[
dS_{t}=r(\theta_{t})S_{t}dt+v(\theta_{t})S_{t}dB_{t}, \] where
$B=(B_{t})_{t\geq0}$ is a Brownian motion, $v$ is a positive function, and
$\theta=(\theta_{t})_{t\geq0}$ is a c\'{a}dl\'{a}g strong Markov process. The
random process $\theta$ is unobservable. We assume also that the asset price
$S_{t}$ is observed only at random times $0<\tau_{1}<\tau_{2}<....$ This is an
appropriate assumption when modelling high frequency financial data (e.g.,
tick-by-tick stock prices).
  In the above setting the problem of estimation of $\theta$ can be approached
as a special nonlinear filtering problem with measurements generated by a
multivariate point process $(\tau_{k},\log S_{\tau_{k}})$. While quite natural,
this problem does not fit into the standard diffusion or simple point process
filtering frameworks and requires more technical tools. We derive a closed form
optimal recursive Bayesian filter for $\theta_{t}$, based on the observations
of $(\tau_{k},\log S_{\tau_{k}})_{k\geq1}$. It turns out that the filter is
given by a recursive system that involves only deterministic Kolmogorov-type
equations, which should make the numerical implementation relatively easy.

They are used here to treat the interesting limiting case of dilute but very
highly charged particles reacting in a dilute, one-component plasma. The highly
charged particles are very strongly coupled to this background plasma. The
effective field theory proves that this mean field solution plus the one-loop

rarely available, and they can serve as benchmarks for testing computer models.

universality class of non-equilibrium 1D expansion-randomization systems with
generic stationary long-range correlations in a regime of growing sequence
length. We obtain explicitly the two-point correlation function of the sequence
composition and the distribution function of the composition bias in sequences
of finite length. The characteristic exponent $\chi$ of these quantities is
determined by the ratio of two effective rates, which are explicitly calculated
for several specific sequence evolution dynamics of the universality class.
Depending on the value of $\chi$, we find two different scaling regimes, which
are distinguished by the detectability of the initial composition bias. All
analytic results are accurately verified by numerical simulations. We also
discuss the non-stationary build-up and decay of correlations, as well as more
complex evolutionary scenarios, where the rates of the processes vary in time.
Our findings provide a possible example for the emergence of universality in
molecular biology.

developments that have led from the first laser cooling schemes to the

has it provided experimentalists with the necessary tools to create ultra-cold

framework to describe them: many effects now being studied in
quantum-degenerate atomic and molecular systems find a very natural explanation
in a quantum optics picture. This article briefly reviews three such examples
that find their direct inspiration in the trailblazing work carried out over
the years by Herbert Walther, one of the true giants of that field.
Specifically, we use an analogy with the micromaser to analyze ultra-cold
molecules in a double-well potential; study the formation and dissociation
dynamics of molecules using the passage time statistics familiar from
superradiance and superfluorescence studies; and show how molecules can be used
to probe higher-order correlations in ultra-cold atomic gases, in particular
bunching and antibunching.

(EPR). It is known that for a three-qubit system there is only one form of the
GHZ-Mermin-like argument with equivalence up to a local unitary transformation,
which is exactly Mermin's version of the GHZ theorem. In this paper, however,
for a four-qubit system which was originally studied by GHZ, we show that there
are nine distinct forms of the GHZ-Mermin-like argument. The proof is obtained
by using some geometric invariants to characterize the sets of mutually
commuting nonlocal spin observables on the four-qubit system. It is proved that
there are at most nine elements (except for a different sign) in a set of
mutually commuting nonlocal spin observables in the four-qubit system, and each
GHZ-Mermin-like argument involves a set of at least five mutually commuting
four-qubit nonlocal spin observables with a GHZ state as a common eigenstate in
GHZ's theorem. Therefore, we present a complete construction of the GHZ theorem

decoherence, the mixing time improves linearly with decoherence, whereas for
large rates of decoherence, the mixing time deteriorates linearly towards the
classical limit. In the middle region of decoherence rates, our numerical data
