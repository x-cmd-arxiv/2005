better understanding of these enigmatic objects. We used data from the SDSS DR1
in order to identify edge-on galaxies with disks in a uniform, reproducible,
automated fashion. We identified 3169 edge-on disk galaxies, which we
subdivided into disk galaxies with bulge, intermediate types, and simple disk
galaxies without any obvious bulge component. We subdivided these types further
into subclasses: Sa(f), Sb(f), Sc(f), Scd(f), Sd(f), Irr(f), where the (f)
indicates that these galaxies are seen edge-on. A number of incompleteness
effects affect our catalog, but it contains almost a factor of four more
bulgeless galaxies with prominent simple disks (flat galaxies) within the area
covered here than previous optical catalogs, which were based on the visual
selection from photographic plates. We find that approximately 15% of the
edge-on disk galaxies in our catalog are flat galaxies, demonstrating that
these galaxies are fairly common, especially among intermediate-mass
star-forming galaxies. Bulgeless disks account for roughly one third of our
galaxies when also puffy disks and edge-on irregulars are included.(Abridged)

an ortho-Ps continuum. The broad line is detected with a flux of
(0.35+/-0.11)e-3 s-1 cm-2. The measured width of 5.4+/-1.2 keV FWHM is in
agreement with the expected broadening of 511 keV photons emitted in the
annihilation of Ps that are formed by the charge exchange process of slowing
down positrons with H atoms. The flux of the narrow line is (0.72+/-0.12)e-3
s-1 cm-2 and its width is 1.3+/-0.4 keV FWHM. The measured ortho-Ps continuum
flux yields a fraction of Ps of (96.7+/-2.2)%. To derive in what phase of the
interstellar medium positrons annihilate, we have fitted annihilation models
calculated for each phase to the data. We have found that 49(+2,-23)% of the
annihilation emission comes from the warm neutral phase and 51(+3,-2)% from the
warm ionized phase. While we may not exclude that less than 23% of the emission
might come from cold gas, we have constrained the fraction of annihilation
emission from molecular clouds and hot gas to be less than 8% and 0.5%,
respectively. We have compared our knowledge of the interstellar medium in the
bulge and the propagation of positrons with our results and found that they are
in good agreement if the sources are diffusively distributed and if the initial
kinetic energy of positrons is lower than a few MeV. Despite its large filling
factor, the lack of annihilation emission from the hot gas is due to its low
density, which allows positrons to escape this phase.

neutron star (NS) or NS+BH mergers and consist of a 4 solar mass BH with varied
spin, girded by a torus with a mass between 0.01 and 0.2 solar masses. The
evolution of tori without and with physical shear viscosity is simulated, using
a realistic equation of state and following the energy loss and lepton number
change due to neutrino emission by a neutrino-trapping scheme. The
time-dependent efficiency of converting rest-mass energy to neutrinos is found
to reach 10 percent, the efficiency of converting neutrino energy into a
pair-photon fireball by neutrino annihilation can reach several percent. The
rate of the latter process declines with time much less steeply than the total
neutrino luminosity, because the ongoing protonization of the torus ensures a
rather stable product of neutrino and antineutrino luminosities. The neutrino
emission increases steeply with higher viscosity, larger torus mass, and larger
BH spin in corotation with the torus. For rotation rates as expected for
post-merger BHs (a > 0.5) and reasonable values of the alpha viscosity (alpha ~
0.1), the considered tori release sufficient energy in neutrinos to account for
the energetics of the well-localized short gamma-ray bursts recently detected

spontaneously in the CMB by a non-linear response to long-wavelength

locally and pick out a single preferred direction. The non-linear response
imprints this direction in a range of multipole moments. We consider two
manifestations of isotropy breaking: additive contributions and multiplicative
modulation of the intrinsic anisotropy. Since WMAP exhibits an alignment of
power deficits, an additive contribution is less likely to produce the observed
alignments than the usual isotropic fluctuations, a fact which we illustrate
with an explicit cosmological model of long-wavelength quintessence
fluctuations. This problem applies to other models involving foregrounds or
background anisotropy that seek to restore power to the CMB. Additive models
that account directly for the observed power exacerbate the low power of the
intrinsic fluctuations. Multiplicative models can overcome these difficulties.
We construct a proof of principle model that significantly improves the
likelihood and generates stronger alignments than WMAP in 30-45% of
realizations.

protostars and young stellar objects, tracing envelope cavities presumably
evacuated by an outflow. The northern lobe of the nebula has an opening angle
of ~100 degrees, while the southern lobe is barely detected. Its morphology
suggests that the bipolar cavity and inferred protostellar disk is not inclined
more than 30 degrees from an edge-on orientation. The nebula extends at least
8"" from the source at Ks, strongly suggesting that L1014-IRS is embedded within
L1014 at a distance of 200 pc rather than in a more distant cloud associated
with the Perseus arm at 2.6 kpc. In this case, the apparently low luminosity of

if L1014-IRS is obscured by a circumstellar disk, its luminosity and inferred

investigate characteristics of the L1014 molecular cloud core. We determine a

find that a fraction 10% of all bursts detected by {\it Swift} will originate

must have extended out to high redshifts in rare massive galaxies that were
enriched by heavy elements earlier than the typical galaxies. In addition, we

rate. Pop III stars are viable progenitors for long-duration GRBs which are
triggered by the collapsar mechanism, as long as they can lose their outer

that the likelihood of Pop III binaries to satisfy the conditions required by

spectra obtained with the HET reveal an asymmetric, triangular-shaped Si II
absorption feature at about 6100 \AA with a sharp transition to the continuum

absorption feature becomes symmetric with smoothly curved sides. Similar Si II
profile evolution has previously been observed in other supernovae, and is
predicted by some explosion models, but its significance has not been fully
recognized. Although the spectra predicted by pure deflagration and delayed
detonation models are similar near maximum light, they predict qualitatively
different chemical abundances in the outer layers and thus give qualitatively
different spectra at the earliest phases. The Si line observed in SN 2005cg at
early times requires the presence of burning products at high velocities and
the triangular shape is likely to be formed in an extended region of slowly
declining Si abundance that characterizes delayed detonation models. The
spectra show a high-velocity Ca II IR feature that coincides in velocity space
with the Si II cutoff. This supports the interpretation that the Ca II is
formed when the outer layers of the SN ejecta sweep up about 5 x 10^-3 M_sun of

the collapse of massive stellar cores. In particular, we consider the state of
the gas falling quasi-spherically onto stellar-mass black holes in the
hypercritical regime, where the accretion rates are in the range 0.001 - 0.5
solar masses per second and neutrinos dominate the cooling. Previous studies
have assumed that in order to have a black hole switch to a luminous state, the
condition l >> r_g c, where l is the specific orbital angular momentum of the
infalling gas and r_g is the Schwarszchild radius, needs to be fulfilled. We
argue that flows in hyperaccreting, stellar mass disks around black holes are
likely to transition to a highly radiative state when their angular momentum is
just above the threshold for disk formation, l ~ 2 r_g c. In a range where l
lies between r_g c and 2 r_g c, a dwarf disk forms in which gas spirals rapidly
into the black hole due to general relativistic effects, without any help from
horizontal viscous stresses. For high rotation rates with l greater than 2 r_g
c, the luminosity is supplied by large, hot equatorial bubbles around the black
hole. The highest neutrino luminosities are obtained for l ~ 2 r_g c, and this
value of angular momentum also produces the most energetic neutrinos, and thus
also the highest energy deposition rates. Given the range of l explored in this
work, we argue that, as long as l is greater than 2 r_g c, low angular momentum
cores may in fact be better suited for producing neutrino--driven explosions
following core collapse in supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

radio galaxy is marginally resolved in i_775 and z_850 showing continuum
emission aligned with the radio axis, similar to what is observed for lower
redshift radio galaxies. Both the half-light radius and the UV star formation
rate are comparable to the typical values found for Lyman break galaxies at
z~4-5. The Lya emitters are sub-L* galaxies, with deduced star formation rates
of 1-10 Msun/yr. One of the Lya emitters is only detected in Lya. Based on the
star formation rate of ~3 Msun/yr calculated from Lya, the lack of continuum
emission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 Myr and is
producing its first stars.
  Observations in V_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additional

compare our results with the expected number of systems that experience mass
transfer in post-main sequence phases of evolution and compute the
uncertainties in the theoretical predictions. We estimate that main-sequence
mergers can account for the observed number of single blue stragglers in M67.
Applied to the blue straggler population, this implies that such mergers are
responsible for about one quarter of the population of halo blue metal poor
stars, and at least one third of the blue stragglers in open clusters for
systems older than 1 Gyr. The observed trends as a function of age are
consistent with a saturated angular momentum loss rate for rapidly rotating
tidally synchronized systems. The predicted number of blue stragglers from main
sequence mergers alone is comparable to the number observed in globular
clusters, indicating that the net effect of dynamical interactions in dense
stellar environments is to reduce rather than increase the blue straggler
population. A population of subturnoff mergers of order 3-4% of the upper main
sequence population is also predicted for stars older than 4 Gyr, which is
roughly comparable to the small population of highly Li-depleted halo dwarfs.

simulations to study the secular evolution of the structure of disk galaxies.
Our simulations are organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity, ranging
from rigid-halo collisionless simulations to fully live simulations with gas
and star formation. Comparisons between the different types of simulations
allow us to isolate the role of various physical mechanisms. We focus on the
evolution of systems expected in a LCDM universe.
  Our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies may
result from secular evolution rather than from direct hierarchical assembly. In
the vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms can lead to heating.
The strongest heating occurs during the vertical buckling instability of a bar.
Among the consequences of this instability is the formation of peanut-shaped
bulges which produce clear kinematic signatures when observed face-on. We find
that bars are robust structures that are not destroyed by buckling. They can be
destroyed instead by a central mass concentration but we find that this mass
needs to be a large fraction of the total mass of the disk. We then study the
evolution of stellar surface density profiles showing how angular momentum
redistribution leads to increasing central densities and disk scale lengths and
to profile breaks at large radii. The breaks in these simulations are in
excellent agreement with observed breaks, even when the evolution is purely
collisionless. Disk scale-lengths increase even when the total disk angular
momentum is conserved; thus mapping halo angular momenta to scale-lengths is
non-trivial. [Abridged]

late-type galaxies that only requires optical or near-IR surface photometry of
a galaxy. Since the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for these samples produces a
continuous relation between baryonic mass and rotational velocity, we conclude
that the difference between dwarfs and disks must be because of their
distribution of stellar light such that dwarfs are more diffuse than disk
galaxies. This structural separation may be due to a primordial difference
between low and high mass galaxies or produced by hierarchical mergers where
disks are built up from dwarfs. Structural differences between dwarf and disk
galaxies may also be driven by the underlying kinematics where the strong
rotation in disks produces an axial symmetric object that undergoes highly
efficient star formation in contrast to the lower rotation, more disordered
motion of dwarfs that produces a diffuse, triaxial object with a history of

validity of the radiation-driven implosion mechanism, where the Lyman continuum
photons from a luminous O star create expanding ionization fronts to evaporate
and compress nearby clouds into bright-rimmed or comet-shaped clouds. Implosive
pressure then causes dense clumps to collapse, prompting the formation of
low-mass stars on the cloud surface (i.e., the bright rim) and
intermediate-mass stars somewhat deeper in the cloud. These stars are a
signpost of current star formation; no young stars are seen leading the
ionization fronts further into the cloud. Young stars in bright-rimmed or

result in an age spread of several megayears between the member stars or star
groups formed in the sequence.

a deficit of brown dwarfs (BD) compared to the Trapezium cluster population
(Briceno et al 1998; Luhman 2000; Luhman et al 2003a; Luhman 2004). However,
these works have concentrated on the highest stellar density regions of the
Taurus cloud. We have performed a large scale optical survey of this region,
covering a total area of 30 deg^2, and encompassing the densest part of the
cloud as well as their surroundings, down to a mass detection limits of 15
Jupiter Masses (MJ). In this paper, we present the optical spectroscopic
follow-up observations of 97 photometrically selected potential new low-mass
Taurus members, of which 27 are strong late-M (SpT < M4V) candidates. These
observations reveal 5 new very low mass (VLM) Taurus members and 12 new BDs.
Combining our observations with previously published results, we derive an
updated substellar to stellar ratio in Taurus of Rss =0.23 +/- 0.05. This ratio
now appears consistent with the value previously derived in the Trapezium
cluster under similar assumptions of 0.26 +/- 0.04. We find strong indication
that the relative numbers of BDs with respect to stars is decreased by a factor
2 in the central regions of the aggregates with respect to the more distributed
population. Our findings are best explained in the context of the

Dark Energy models, causes segregation between Dark Matter (DM) and baryons, as
the gravitational infall into the potential well proceeds more slowly for the
baryons than for DM. As a consequence, after attaining their turn-around and
before full virialization, halos have outer layers rich of baryons.
Accordingly, a natural ambiguity exists on the definition of the virial density
contrast. In fact, when the outer baryon layers infall onto the DM-richer core,
they carry with them DM materials outside the original fluctuation; hence, no
time exists when all materials originally belonging to the fluctuation -and
only them- have virialized. Baryon-DM segregation can have various
astrophysical consequences on different length-scales. The smallest halos may
loose up to 50% of the original baryonic contents and become hardly visible.
Subhalos in cluster-size halos may loose much baryonic materials, which could
then be observed as intra-cluster light. Isolated halos, in general, can be
expected to have a baryon component richer than the cosmological proportions,
due to the cosmic enrichement of baryons lost in small halo encounters.

use cosmological dark matter simulations of clusters to test the reliability of
the method, producing mock catalogues of tangential and radial gravitational
arcs and simulating the radial velocity dispersion profile of the cluster
brightest central galaxy. The density profiles of the simulated clusters
closely follow the NFW form, but we find that the recovered values of the inner
slope are systematically underestimated, by about 0.4 in the mean, if the lens
is assumed to be axially symmetric. However, if the ellipticity and orientation
of the iso-contours of the cluster lensing potential are taken into account,
then the inner slopes can be recovered quite accurately for a significant
subset of the clusters whose central surface density profiles appear the most
regular. These have lensing potentials with ellipticities in the range
0.15-0.4. Further simulations projecting one cluster along many random
lines-of-sight show that, even for lower ellipticities, the central slopes are
underestimated by $\sim 10-35%$. These simulations closely mimic past
observations (see e.g. Sand et al., 2004), suggesting that existing estimates
of the central slopes may be biased towards low values. For the remaining
clusters, where the lensing potential is strongly perturbed by active merging
or by substructure, the correct determination of the inner slope requires a
more accurate model for the lens. When the halo profile is modelled by a
generalised NFW profile, we find that the inferred scale radius and
characteristic density, unlike the inner slope, are generally poorly
constrained, since there is a strong degeneracy between these two parameters.

Comparisons with other data show that the jet changes direction close the

wobble of the parent star. This wobble leads to the periodic modulation of
three observables: the radial velocity, the position on the sky and the time of
arrival of periodic signals. We show that the same wobble, and therefore the
same modulation of the three observables, can be due to the presence of a more
distant binary stellar companion. Thus, the observation of the wobble does not,
by itself, constitute a proof of a planet detection. In particular, astrometric
confirmation of a wobble does not necessarily provide a sufficient proof of the
existence of a planet candidate detected by radial velocity. Additional
conditions, which we discuss here, must be fulfilled. We investigate the
observed wobble for the planet candidates already detected and we find that,
for each case, a wobble due to a binary stellar companion can be excluded. But
for apparent Saturn-like planets in wide orbits, there may be an ambiguity in
future detections, especially in spaceborne astrometric missions. We conclude
that, in some cases, a definitive proof for the presence of a planet requires
further observations such as direct imaging.

The decomposition technique uses separate sets of galaxy and quasar

spectrum, its contributing fraction, and its classification. We show how the
accuracy of the decomposition depends upon S/N, host galaxy fraction, and the
galaxy class. Based on the eigencoefficients, the sample of SDSS broad-line AGN
host galaxies spans a wide range of spectral types, but the distribution
differs significantly from inactive galaxies. In particular, post-starburst
activity appears to be much more common among AGN host galaxies. The
luminosities of the hosts are much higher than expected for normal early-type
galaxies, and their colors become increasingly bluer than early-type galaxies
with increasing host luminosity. Most of the AGNs with detected hosts are
emitting at between 1% and 10% of their estimated Eddington luminosities, but
the sensitivity of the technique usually does not extend to the Eddington

analysis of the effects of galaxy interactions on the star formation activity

can be effectively correlated with an enhancement of star formation activity
with respect to galaxies without a close companion. Our results suggest that
the stability properties of systems are also relevant in this process. We found
that the passive star forming galaxies pairs tend to have deeper potential
wells, older stellar populations, and less leftover gas than active star
forming ones. In order to assess the effects that projection and interlopers
could introduce in observational samples, we have also constructed and analysed
projected simulated catalogs of galaxy pairs. In good agreement with

enhance the star formation activity with respect to galaxies without a close

the density dependence is stronger for galaxies in pairs suggesting a relevant

a combined dc drive and circular ac drive produce a drift velocity in the
direction transverse to the applied dc drive. The random disorder does not
break any global symmetry; however, in two dimensions, symmetry breaking occurs
due to the chirality of the circular drive. In addition to inducing the
transverse ratchet effect, increasing the ac amplitude also strongly affects
the longitudinal velocity response and can produce what we term an overshoot
effect where the longitudinal dc velocity is higher in the presence of the ac
drive than it would be for a dc drive alone. We also find a dynamical
reordering transition upon increasing the ac amplitude. In the absence of a dc
drive, it is possible to obtain a ratchet effect when the combined ac drives
produce particle orbits that break a reflection symmetry. In this case, as the
ac amplitude increases, current reversals can occur. These effects may be
observable for vortices in type II superconductors as well as for colloids

$2\Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the superfluid gap energy. Furthermore,
polarization-selective light scattering allows for unequal energy and momentum
transfer to the two partner atoms of a Cooper-pair. In the regime of low energy
($<< 2\Delta$) and low momentum ($<2\Delta/(\hbar v_F)$, $v_F$ being the Fermi
velocity) transfer, a small difference in momentum transfers to the two
spin-components may be useful in exciting Bogoliubov-Anderson phonon mode. We
present detailed results on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) deduced from the
response function making use of generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
Model calculations using local density approximation for trapped superfluid
Fermi gas shows that when the energy transfer is less than $2\Delta_0$, where
$\Delta_0$ refers to the gap at the trap center, DSF as a function of energy
transfer has reduced gradient compared to that of normal Fermi gas.

and concentration measurements through MRI techniques. We find that the flow is
localized at low velocities, and that the material is inhomogeneous; the local
laws inferred from macroscopic rheometric observations must then be
reinterpreted in the light of these local observations. We show that the short
time response to a velocity step allows to characterize dense suspensions
locally: they have a purely viscous behavior, without any observable influence
of friction. In the jammed zone, there may be a contact network, whereas in the
sheared zone there are only hydrodynamic interactions: localization consists in
a change in configuration at the grain scale. From the concentration and
velocity profiles, we have provided for the first time local measurements of
the concentration dependence of viscosity; we find a Krieger-Dougherty law
$\eta(\phi)=\eta_0(1-\phi/0.605)^{-2}$. Shear induced migration is almost
instantaneous and seems inconsistent with most observations: it would imply
that the diffusion coefficients strongly depend on the concentration. We
finally propose a simple constitutive law for dense suspensions, based on a
purely viscous behavior, that accounts for all the macroscopic and local
observations.

such a problem, upper bound on the reheating temperature after the inflation is
obtained, which may be as low as \sim 10^{5-6} GeV. For a successful
baryogenesis with such low reheating temeprature, a consistent scenario based
on the large cutoff supergravity (LCSUGRA) hypothesis of supersymmetry
breaking, where the gravitino and sfermion become as heavy as \sim O(1-10 TeV),

baryon asymmetry. We also see that, in the LCSUGRA scenario, relic density of

to this analysis is the determination of all of the zero modes associated with
small fluctuations around the hedgehog. These are used in the conventional way
to construct collective coordinates. This approach differs from previous work
in that it does not implicitly assume that each static zero mode is associated
with a dynamical zero mode. It is demonstrated explicitly in the context of the
Skyrmion that there are fewer dynamical zero modes than static ones due to the
Witten-Wess-Zumino term in the action. Group-theoretic methods are employed to
identify the physical states resulting from canonical quantization of the
collectively rotating soliton. The collective states fall into representations
of SU(3) flavor labeled by $(p,q)$ and are given by $(2J, \frac{Nc}{2} -J)$
where $J={1/2},{3/2},... $ is the spin of the collective state. States with
strangeness $S > 0$ do not arise as collective states from this procedure; thus

the following features incorporated in it. (i) The full spacetime is higher
dimensional, with (possibly) compact extra-dimensions; (ii) There is a natural
minimal length below which the concept of continuum spacetime needs to be
modified by some deeper concept. On the other hand, the existence of a minimal
length (or zero-point length) in four-dimensional spacetime, with obvious
implications as UV regulator, has been often conjectured as a natural aftermath
of any correct quantum theory of gravity. We show that one can incorporate the
apparently unrelated pieces of information - zero-point length,
extra-dimensions, string T-duality - in a consistent framework. This is done in
terms of a modified Kaluza-Klein theory that interpolates between (high-energy)
string theory and (low-energy) quantum field theory. In this model, the
zero-point length in four dimensions is a ``virtual memory'' of the length
scale of compact extra-dimensions.
  Such a scale turns out to be determined by T-duality inherited from the
underlying fundamental string theory. From a low energy perspective short
distance infinities are cut off by a minimal length which is proportional to
the square root of the string slope, i.e. \sqrt{\alpha^\prime}. Thus, we bridge
the gap between the string theory domain and the low energy arena of
point-particle quantum field theory.

propose an analogue of Brownian motion that has as its state space an arbitrary
closed subset of the line that is unbounded above and below: such a process
will be a martingale, will have the identity function as its quadratic
variation process, and will be ``continuous'' in the sense that its sample
paths don't skip over points. We show that there is a unique such process,
which turns out to be automatically a reversible Feller-Dynkin Markov process.
We find its generator, which is a natural generalization of the operator
$f\mapsto{1/2}f''$. We then consider the special case where the state space is
the self-similar set $\{\pm q^k:k\in \mathbb{Z}\}\cup\{0\}$ for some $q>1$.
Using the scaling properties of the process, we represent the Laplace
transforms of various hitting times as certain continued fractions that appear
in Ramanujan's ``lost'' notebook and evaluate these continued fractions in
terms of basic hypergeometric functions (that is, $q$-analogues of classical
hypergeometric functions). The process has 0 as a regular instantaneous point,
and hence its sample paths can be decomposed into a Poisson process of
excursions from 0 using the associated continuous local time. Using the
reversibility of the process with respect to the natural measure on the state
space, we find the entrance laws of the corresponding It\^{o} excursion measure
and the Laplace exponent of the inverse local time -- both again in terms of
basic hypergeometric functions. By combining these ingredients, we obtain
explicit formulae for the resolvent of the process. We also compute the moments
of the process in closed form. Some of our results involve $q$-analogues of
classical distributions such as the Poisson distribution that have appeared
elsewhere in the literature.

has more than two local extrema per cycle. With this insight, we construct a
multi-frequency forcing function that generates at onset a non-trivial harmonic
instability which is distinct from a subharmonic response to any of its
frequency components. We measure the corresponding surface patterns
experimentally and verify that small changes in the forcing waveform cause a
transition, through a bicritical point, from the predicted harmonic
short-wavelength pattern to a much larger standard subharmonic pattern. Using a
formulation valid in the lubrication regime (thin viscous fluid layer) and a
WKB method to find its analytic solutions, we explore the origin of the
observed relation between the forcing function shape and the resonance tongue
structure. In particular, we show that for square and triangular forcing
functions the envelope of these tongues has only one minimum, as in the usual
sinusoidal case.

has been made to analyze whether the electrophilicity index is a reliable

the corresponding calculated electrophilicity values. Chlorination of various
substituted ethylenes and nitration of toluene and chlorobenzene are studied as

improves drastically by removing a few data points to show that the
electrophilicity is a kinetic quantity with inherent thermodynamic information.
The correlation between the experimental and the calculated activation energies
is studied for some Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov addition reactions and is
turned out to be reasonably well. Reaction electrophilicity, local
electrophilicity and activation hardness are used together to provide a
transparent picture of reaction rates as well as the orientation of aromatic
electrophilic substitution reactions. Ambiguity in the definition of the

  growth: Extending the resource-based theory","21 pages",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  The simultaneous growth of multiple microbial species is a problem of
fundamental ecological interest. In media containing more than one
growth-limiting substrate, multiple species can coexist. The question then
arises: Can single-species data predict the existence and stability of
mixed-culture steady states in mixed-substrate environments? This question has
been extensively studied with the help of resource-based models. These studies
have shown that the single-species data required to predict mixed-culture
behavior consists of the growth isoclines and consumption vectors, which in
turn are determined from single-substrate data by making specific assumptions
about the kinetics of mixed-substrate growth. Here, we show that these
assumptions are not valid for microbial growth on mixtures of substitutable
substrates. However, the theory can be developed by determining the growth
isoclines and consumption vectors directly from the mixed-substrate data, thus
obviating the need for specific assumptions about the kinetics of
mixed-substrate growth. We show furthermore that in addition to the growth
isoclines and consumption vectors, the single-species, mixed-substrate data
yields a new family of curves, which we call the consumption curves.
Consideration of the growth isoclines and the consumption curves yields deeper
insights into the behavior of the mixed cultures. It yields a priori bounds on
the substrate concentrations achieved during coexistence, permits the extension
of the theory to systems in which the growth isoclines are non-monotonic, and
clarifies earlier results obtained by considering only the growth isoclines.

conditions, they exhibit long lags before adjusting to the new environment. The
identity of the rate-limiting step for this slow response can be inferred from
the initial yields and specific growth rates measured by exposing steady state
cultures at various dilution rates to substrate-excess conditions. We measured
these parameters for glucose-limited cultures of E. coli ML308 growing at
various dilution rates between 0.03 and 0.6 1/hr. In all the cases, the initial
yields were 20-30% less than the steady state yields. The decline of the yield
implies that overflow metabolism is triggered in response to excess glucose. It
is therefore unlikely that the initial response of the cells is limited by
substrate uptake. The initial specific growth rates of cultures growing at low
dilution rates (D = 0.03, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.3 1/hr) were significantly higher
than the steady state specific growth rates. However, the increment in the
specific growth rate decreased with the dilution rate, and at D=0.6 1/hr, there
was no improvement in the specific growth rate. The initial specific growth
rates varied hyperbolically with the dilution, decreasing sharply at dilution
rates below 0.1 1/hr and saturating at D=0.6 1/hr. This is consistent with a
picture in which the initial response is limited by the activity of glutamate
dehydrogenase.

position and momentum of a particle in the phase space distributions, the three
Cartesian components, $J_{x}$,$J_{y}$, $J_{z}$ of a spin-$j$ system constitute
the mutually non-commuting variates in the quasi-probabilistic spin
distributions. It can be shown that a univariate spin distribution is never
squeezed and one needs to look into either bivariate or trivariate
distributions for signatures of squeezing. Several such distributions result if
one considers different characteristic functions or moments based on various
correspondence rules. As an example, discrete probability distribution for an
arbitrary spin-1 assembly is constructed using Wigner-Weyl and Margenau-Hill
correspondence rules. It is also shown that a trivariate spin-1 assembly
resulting from the exposure of nucleus with non-zero quadrupole moment to
combined electric quadrupole field and dipole magnetic field exhibits squeezing
in cerain cases.

  distribution","17 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a review on the historic development of the decoy state method,
including the background, principles, methods, results and development. We also
clarify some delicate concepts. Given an imperfect source and a very lossy
channel, the photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack can make the quantum key
distribution (QKD) in practice totally insecure. Given the result of ILM-GLLP,
one knows how to distill the secure final key if he knows the fraction of
tagged bits. The purpose of decoy state method is to do a tight verification of
the the fraction of tagged bits. The main idea of decoy-state method is
changing the intensities of source light and one can verify the fraction of
tagged bits of certain intensity by watching the the counting rates of pulses
of different intensities. Since the counting rates are small quantities, the
effect of statistical fluctuation is very important. It has been shown that
3-state decoy-state method in practice can work even with the fluctuations and
other errors.

wave function for slowly changing Hamiltonians. A constructive technique for
explicit separation of fast and slow components of the wave function is
developed. The fast components are determined by dynamic phases, while the slow
components are given by asymptotic series evaluated by means of an explicit
recurrent procedure. It is shown that the slow components represent
quasiadiabatic states, which play conceptually the same role as energy levels
in stationary systems or Floquet states in time-periodic systems. As an
application, we derive high-order asymptotic expressions for quasienergies of
periodic Hamiltonians. As examples, a two-state (spin-1/2) system in
periodically changing magnetic filed, and a particle in moving square potential
well are studied.
