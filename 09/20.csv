  Turbulent Mixing on Gas--phase Chemistry","11 pages, 7 figures; accepted for publication in A & A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20053867",,"astro-ph",,"  We calculate the ionisation fraction in protostellar disk models using two
different gas-phase chemical networks, and examine the effect of turbulent
mixing by modelling the diffusion of chemical species vertically through the
disk. The aim is to determine in which regions of the disk gas can couple to a
magnetic field and sustain MHD turbulence. We find that the effect of diffusion
depends crucially on the elemental abundance of heavy metals (magnesium)
included in the chemical model. In the absence of heavy metals, diffusion has
essentially no effect on the ionisation structure of the disks, as the
recombination time scale is much shorter than the turbulent diffusion time
scale. When metals are included with an elemental abundance above a threshold
value, the diffusion can dramatically reduce the size of the magnetically
decoupled region, or even remove it altogther. For a complex chemistry the
elemental abundance of magnesium required to remove the dead zone is 10(-10) -
10(-8). We also find that diffusion can modify the reaction pathways, giving
rise to dominant species when diffusion is switched on that are minor species
when diffusion is absent. This suggests that there may be chemical signatures
of diffusive mixing that could be used to indirectly detect turbulent activity
in protoplanetary disks. We find examples of models in which the dead zone in
the outer disk region is rendered deeper when diffusion is switched on. Overall
these results suggest that global MHD turbulence in protoplanetary disks may be
self-sustaining under favourable circumstances, as turbulent mixing can help
maintain the ionisation fraction above that necessary to ensure good coupling
between the gas and magnetic field.

maxima, and declined rapidly after the second maximum, while the spectra showed
strengthening He lines whose velocity increased with time. The double-peaked LC
can be reproduced by a double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution, with most
$^{56}$Ni at low velocity and a small amount at high velocity. The rapid
post-maximum decline requires a large fraction of the $\gamma$-rays to escape
from the $^{56}$Ni-dominated region, possibly because of low-density ``holes''.
The presence of Balmer lines in the spectrum suggests that the He layer of the
progenitor was substantially intact. Increasing $\gamma$-ray deposition in the
He layer due to enhanced $\gamma$-ray escape from the $^{56}$Ni-dominated
region may explain both the delayed strengthening and the increasing velocity
of the He lines. The SN has massive ejecta ($\sim6-7\Msun$), normal kinetic
energy ($\sim 1.0-1.5\times 10^{51}$ ergs), high peak bolometric luminosity
($\sim 5\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) for an epoch as late as $\sim$ 40 days,
and a large $^{56}$Ni mass ($\sim0.32\Msun$). These properties, and the
presence of a small amount of H suggest that the progenitor was initially
massive (M$\sim 25-30 \Msun$) and had lost most of its H envelope, and was
possibly a WN star. The double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution suggests that the

that for the $\sim$4000 stars which have time-series data, 56% are variable and
of these, approximately 13% are observed to exhibit periodic light curves

curves obtained and produce cuts in variability space based on parameters such
as color and amplitude. The percentage of variability is approximately equal
across all colors with the majority of variables having amplitudes of 0.15
magnitudes or less. In general, redder stars show larger variability
amplitudes. We find a smooth decline in the number of periodic variables toward
longer period. This decline is probably due to a transition from intrinsic to
extrinsic variability and, in part, to our limited observing period of 12
nights. Essentially all the A and F main sequence stars in our sample are
variable ($\sim$2 mmag and larger) and most present complex light curves
containing multiple periods suggestive of their inclusion in the $\delta$Sct

counter to the rotation of the inner part of the galaxy. The turnover radius is

inversion method of Nusser & Haehnelt (1999). The optical depth is converted to
density by using a simple power law relation, $\tau \propto (1+\delta)^\alpha$.
The non-linear 1D power spectrum of the gas density is then inferred with a
method that makes simultaneous use of the 1 and 2 point statistics of the flux
and compared against theoretical models with a likelihood analysis. A Cold Dark
Matter (CDM) model with standard cosmological parameters fits the data well.
The power spectrum amplitude is measured to be (assuming a flat Universe),
$\sigma_8 = (0.9 \pm 0.09)\times (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{-0.3}$, with $\alpha$
varying in the range of $1.56-1.8$ with redshift. Enforcing the same
cosmological parameters in all four redshift bins, the likelihood analysis
suggests some evolution in the density-temperature relation and the thermal
smoothing length of the gas. The inferred evolution is consistent with that
expected if reionization of \hep occurred at $z\sim 3.2$. A joint analysis with
the WMAP results together with a prior on the Hubble constant as suggested by
the HST key project data, yields values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ that

luminous LBGs have a steeper correlation function. To compare these
observational results, we constructed numerical mock LBG catalogs based on a
semianalytic model of hierarchical clustering combined with high-resolution
N-body simulation, carefully mimicking the observational selection effects. The
luminosity functions for LBGs predicted by this mock catalog were found to be
almost consistent with the observation. Moreover, the overall correlation
functions of LBGs were reproduced reasonably well. The observed dependence of
the clustering on UV luminosity was not reproduced by the model, unless
subsamples of distinct halo mass were considered. That is, LBGs belonging to
more massive dark haloes had steeper and larger-amplitude correlation
functions. With this model, we found that LBG multiplicity in massive dark
halos amplifies the clustering strength at small scales, which steepens the
slope of the correlation function. The hierarchical clustering model could
therefore be reconciled with the observed luminosity-dependence of the angular
correlation function, if there is a tight correlation between UV luminosity and
halo mass. Our finding that the slope of the correlation function depends on
luminosity could be an indication that massive dark halos hosted multiple

the second outburst in 2004. The peak bolometric luminosity is about 3e40 erg/s

be fitted with a blackbody model with temperatures of 40-80 eV, similar to

spatially-resolved gas kinematics in the Narrow Line Region (NLR). These
observations effectively isolate the nuclear line profiles on less than 100 pc
scales and are used to investigate the origin of the substantial scatter
between the widths of strong NLR lines and the stellar velocity dispersion
sigma_* of the host galaxy, a quantity which relates with substantially less
scatter to the mass of the central, supermassive black hole, and more generally
characterize variations in the NLR velocity field with radius. We find that
line widths measured with STIS at a range of spatial scales systematically
underestimate both sigma_* and the line width measured from ground-based
observations, although they do have comparably large scatter to the relation
between ground-based NLR line width and sigma_*. There are no obvious trends in
the residuals when compared with a range of host galaxy and nuclear properties.
The widths and asymmetries of [OIII] 5007 and [SII] 6716, 6731 as a function of
radius exhibit a wide range of behavior. Some of the most common phenomena are
substantial width increases from the STIS to the large-scale, ground-based
aperture and almost no change in line profile between the unresolved nuclear
spectrum and ground-based measurements. We identify asymmetries in a
surprisingly large fraction of low-ionization [SII] line profiles and several
examples of substantial red asymmetries in both [OIII] and [SII]. These results
underscore the complexity of the circumnuclear material that constitutes the
NLR and suggest that the scatter in the NLR width and sigma_* correlation can
not be substantially reduced with a simple set of empirical relations.

the most likely ULX mass range is only ~ 30--200 M_sun; in fact, they are very
rarely found at or very near ULX positions. Protostellar envelopes and gas
accretion favour captures and mergers in dense cores of embedded clusters.
Moreover, protoclusters with masses ~ 10^{3.5} - 10^{4.5} M_sun are likely to
disperse quickly into loose OB associations, where most ULXs are found.
Sufficiently high protostellar density may be achieved when clustered star
formation is triggered by galaxy collisions and mergers. Low metallicity may
then be necessary to ensure that a large fraction of the stellar mass ends up
in a black hole. In this scenario, most ULXs are naturally explained as the
extreme end of the high-mass X-ray binary population.

whether they represent an extension in the luminosity function of binary X-ray

class of objects, e.g., systems containing intermediate-mass black holes (100 -
1000 M_sun). We suggest searching for X-ray and optical eclipses in these

hole accretors should be at least twice as likely to exhibit eclipses as
intermediate-mass black hole systems - and perhaps much more than a factor of
two. Among other system parameters, the orbital period would follow. This would
provide considerable insight as to the nature of the binary.

postulating the existence of the dark matter. We obtain the exact galactic

the flat rotation curves could extend several hundred kpc. The limiting radius

foreground distribution of large-scale structure. The resulting magnification
of supernovae is statistically measurable, and the angular correlation of the
magnification pattern directly probes the integrated mass density along the
line of sight. Measurements of cosmic magnification of supernovae therefore
complements galaxy shear measurements in providing a direct measure of
clustering of the dark matter. As the number of supernovae is typically much
smaller than the number of sheared galaxies, the two-point correlation function
of lensed Type Ia supernovae suffers from significantly increased shot noise.
Neverthless, we find that the magnification map of a large sample of
supernovae, such as that expected from next generation dedicated searches, will
be easily measurable and provide an important cosmological tool. For example, a
search over 20 sq. deg. over five years leading to a sample of ~ 10,000
supernovae would measure the angular power spectrum of cosmic magnification
with a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of ~20. This detection can be further
improved once the supernova distance measurements are cross-correlated with
measurements of the foreground galaxy distribution. The magnification maps made
using supernovae can be used for important cross-checks with traditional
lensing shear statistics obtained in the same fields, as well as help to
control systematics. We discuss two applications of supernova magnification
maps: the breaking of the mass-sheet degeneracy when estimating masses of
shear-detected clusters, and constraining the second-order corrections to weak
lensing observables.

which we have 18.5-GHz data (66% of the complete sample) are systematically
steeper than the low-frequency (2.7-5 GHz) ones, and there is evidence of an
anti-correlation of high-frequency spectral index with luminosity. The
completeness of the 18.5-GHz data is much higher (89%) for flat-spectrum
sources (mostly quasars), which also exhibit a spectral steepening. Taking
advantage of the almost complete redshift information on flat-spectrum quasars,
we have estimated their 5-GHz luminosity function in several redshift bins. The

including the full covariance matrix of supernova distance measurements, we
show that a future survey covering more than a few square degrees on the sky,
and assuming a total of ~2000 SNe, will be largely unaffected by covariance
noise. ``Pencil beam'' surveys with small fields of view, however, will be
prone to the lensing covariance, leading to potentially significant
degradations in cosmological parameter estimates. For a survey with 30 arcmin
mean separation between SNe, lensing covariance leads to a ~45% increase in the
expected errors in dark energy parameters compared to fully neglecting lensing,
and a ~20% increase compared to including just the lensing variance. Given that
the lensing covariance is cosmology dependent and cannot be mapped out
sufficiently accurately with direct weak lensing observations, surveys with

defined, complete in B mag, and distance limited: it consists of the nearest
(D<22 Mpc) 27 Seyfert galaxies (9 of type 1, 18 of type 2) taken from the Ho et
al. (1997) sample. This is one of the largest atlases of hard X-ray spectra of
low-L active galaxies ever assembled. All nuclear sources except two Sey 2s are
detected between 2-10 keV, half for the first time ever, and average spectra
are obtained for all of them. Nuclear luminosities reach values down to 10**38
erg/s. The shape of the distribution of X-ray parameters is affected by the
presence of Compton-thick objects (> 30% among type 2s). The latter have been
identified either directly from their intense FeK line and flat X-ray spectra,
or indirectly with flux diagnostic diagrams which use isotropic indicators.
After taking into account these highly absorbed sources, we find that (i) the
intrinsic X-ray spectral properties (i.e., spectral shapes and luminosities
above 2 keV) are consistent between type 1 and type 2 Sey, as expected from
``unified models'', (ii) Sey galaxies as a whole are distributed fairly
continuously over the entire range of Nh, between 10**20 and 10**25 cm**-2, and
(iii) while Sey 1s tend to have lower Nh and Sey 2s tend to have the highest,
we find 30% and 10% exceptions, respectively. Overall the sample well
represents the average intrinsic X-ray spectral properties of nearby AGN,
including a proper estimate of the distribution of their absorbing columns.
Finally, we conclude that, with the exception of a few cases, the present study
agrees with predictions of unified models of Sey galaxies, and extends their
validity down to very low luminosities.

absorption by CaII and NaI at high radial velocities near -150 km/s toward the
quasar PKS 1448-232 (l=335.4, b=+31.7). Follow-up HI 21cm observations with the
VLA unveil the presence of a complex of small neutral hydrogen clumps with HI
column densities <8x10^18 cm^-2. The measured HI line widths imply that the gas
is relatively cold with temperatures T<900 K. Although the line of sight
towards PKS 1448-232 does not pass immediately through a known large
high-velocity cloud (HVC), the sky position and the measured radial velocities
suggest that these clumps are associated with HVC cloud complex L. An
inspection of other UVES quasar spectra shows that weak, narrow CaII absorption
at high velocities is a common phenomenon, even in directions where
high-velocity HI 21cm emission is not detected. This suggests that the Milky
Way halo contains a large number of high-velocity neutral gas clumps with low
HI column densities. If such clumps are typical for halos of spiral galaxies,
they should contribute significantly to the population of strong MgII absorbers
and Lyman-Limit Systems (LLS) seen in the circumgalactic environment of other
galaxies.

subsequent formation of exotic atoms. These exotic atoms decay with the
emission of X-rays of precisely defined energy and a correlated pion signature
from nuclear annihilation. This signature uniquely characterizes the
antideuterons. Preliminary analysis of data from a prototype GAPS in an

investigated. We show how to transform the linear Boltzmann equation describing
the dynamics of the tracer into a master equation for a continuous Markov

of the gas. When the gas has a Gaussian velocity probability distribution
function (pdf), the stationary velocity pdf of the tracer is Gaussian with a
lower temperature and satisfies detailed balance for any value of the
restitution coefficient $\alpha$. As soon as the velocity pdf of the gas
departs from the Gaussian form, detailed balance is violated. This
non-equilibrium state can be characterized in terms of a Lebowitz-Spohn action
functional $W(\tau)$ defined over trajectories of time duration $\tau$. We
discuss the properties of this functional and of a similar functional
$\bar{W}(\tau)$ which differs from the first for a term which is non-extensive
in time. On the one hand we show that in numerical experiments, i.e. at finite
times $\tau$, the two functionals have different fluctuations and $\bar{W}$
always satisfies an Evans-Searles-like symmetry. On the other hand we cannot
observe the verification of the Lebowitz-Spohn-Gallavotti-Cohen (LS-GC)
relation, which is expected for $W(\tau)$ at very large times $\tau$. We give
an argument for the possible failure of the LS-GC relation in this situation.

lattices $L\times L$, $L\lesssim 10^3$. We show that the low-temperature phase
of these models is controlled by the same line of Gaussian fixed points as in

by varying temperature, then the transition is of first order. In the opposite
case we observe two very close transitions: a transition associated with the
spin degrees of freedom and, as temperature increases, a transition where
chiral modes become critical. If they are continuous, they belong to the

and Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior is observed only after a preasymptotic regime,

films on LaAlO3 substrates. As-grown thin films, exhibiting Curie temperature,
TC, well below that of the LCMO bulk material, develop an unexpected Mn2+
contribution after a few days of air exposure which increases with time.
Moreover, a reduction of the saturation magnetization, MS, is also detected.
The similarity of the results obtained by electron yield and fluorescence yield
demonstrates that the location of the Mn valence anomalies are not confined to
a narrow surface region of the film but can extend throughout the film
thickness in case of granular films. High temperature annealing not only
improves the magnetic and transport properties of such as-grown films but also
recovers the expected 2/3-1/3 Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio, which thereafter is stable to
air exposure. Similar results on La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 films grown on SrTiO3 and

time-scale. Analytical solution of the aging dynamics at low temperatures shows
that a nonequilibrium or effective temperature can be associated to each
time-scale or mode. The spectrum of effective temperatures shows two regions
that are separated by an age dependent boundary threshold. Region I is
characterized by partially equilibrated modes that relax faster than the modes
at the threshold boundary. Thermal fluctuations and time-correlations for modes
in region I show that those modes are in mutual thermal equilibrium at a unique
age-dependent effective temperature $\Theta (s)$. In contrast, modes with
relaxational timescales longer than that of modes at the threshold (region II)
show diffusive properties and do not share the common temperature $\Theta (s)$.
The shift of the threshold toward lower energy modes as the system ages, and
the progressive shrinking of region II, determines how the full spectrum of
modes equilibrates. As is usually done in experiments, we have defined a
frequency-dependent effective temperature and we have found that all modes in
region I are mutually equilibrated at the temperature $\Theta (s)$
independently of the probing frequency. The present model aims to explain
transport anomalies observed in supercooled liquids in terms of a collection of
structurally disordered and cooperative rearranging mesoscopic regions.

games. The first one involves the notion of (strict, weak, etc) dominance and
the second the notion of rationalizability. In the case of dominance the
criterion of order independence allowed us to clarify which notions and under
what circumstances are robust. In the case of rationalizability this criterion
has not been considered. In this paper we investigate the problem of order
independence for rationalizability by focusing on three naturally entailed
reduction relations on games. These reduction relations are distinguished by
the adopted reference point for the notion of a better response. Additionally,
they are parametrized by the adopted system of beliefs. We show that for one
reduction relation the outcome of its (possibly transfinite) iterations does
not depend on the order of elimination of the strategies. This result does not
hold for the other two reduction relations. However, under a natural assumption
the iterations of all three reduction relations yield the same outcome. The
obtained order independence results apply to the frameworks considered in
Bernheim 84 and Pearce 84. For finite games the iterations of all three
reduction relations coincide and the order independence holds for three natural
systems of beliefs considered in the literature.

Ademollo-Gatto theorem, are free from the contamination of unknown low energy
constants. The results complete and correct previous calculations, and show
that subleading corrections cannot be neglected. We also studied decuplet
contributions within HBChPT and show that, in this case, the chiral expansion
breaks down, rising doubts on the consistency of the theory.

scalar field $\phi$ through a Yukawa interaction. The phase diagram is rather
well understood. If the fermions are massless, there is a chiral transition at
$T_c$: for $T < T_c$ chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. At $N_f=\infty$
the transition is mean-field like, while, for any finite $N_f$, standard
arguments predict Ising behavior. This apparent contradiction has been
explained by Kogut et al., who showed by scaling arguments and Monte Carlo
simulations that in the large-$N_f$ limit the width of the Ising critical
region scales as a power of $1/N_f$, so that only mean-field behavior is
observed for $N_f$ strictly equal to infinity. We will show how the results of
Kogut et al. can be recovered analytically in the framework of a generalized
$1/N_f$ expansion. The method we use is a simple generalization of the method
we have recently applied to a two-dimensional generalized Heisenberg model.

a second potential term which is rescaled by the golden ratio. We explicitly

completeness (sufficiency) for the solution of many mathematical and
physical-mathematical problems formulated on this plane. There is no such
completeness in the case of Euclidean, pseudo-Euclidean and polynumber spaces
of dimension greater than two. In the present paper we show that using the
concepts of analogical geometries allows us to generalize conformal
transformations not only to the case of Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean spaces,
but also to the case of Finsler spaces, analogous to the spaces of affine
connectedness. Examples of such transformations in the case of complex and
hypercomplex numbers H_4 are presented. In the general case such
transformations form a group of transitions, the elements of which can be
viewed as transitions between projective Euclidean geometries of a
distinguished class fixed by the choice of metric geometry admitting affine
coordinates. The correlation between functions realizing generalized conformal
transformations and generalized analytical functions can appear to be
productive for the solution of fundamental problems in theoretical and
mathematical physics.
