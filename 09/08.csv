supermassive black holes (MBH) and the mass (Mbulge) and luminosity of the host
galaxy bulge. We investigate the same relation at z>=1. Using virial mass
estimates for 11 quasars at z >~2 to measure their black hole mass, we find
that black holes at high z fall nearly on the same MBH versus R-band magnitude
(MR) relation (to ~0.3 mag) as low-redshift active and inactive galaxies,
without making any correction for luminosity evolution. Using a set of
conservative assumptions about the host galaxy stellar population, we show that
at z>~2 (10 Gyrs ago) the ratio of MBH/Mbulge was 3--6 times larger than today.
Barring unknown systematic errors on the measurement of MBH, we also rule out
scenarios in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at z>~2 were fully formed
bulges that passively fade to the present epoch. On the other hand, 5 quasar
hosts at z~1 are consistent with current day MBH-MR relationship after taking
into account evolution, appropriate for that of E/S0 galaxies. Therefore, z~1
host galaxies appear to fit the hypothesis they are fully formed early-type
galaxies. We also find that most quasar hosts with absolute magnitudes brighter
than MR = -23 cannot fade below L* galaxies today, regardless of their stellar
population makeup, because their black hole masses are too high and they must
arrive at the local MBH-MR relationship by z=0.

heavy-element quasar absorption lines, using the Goddard Fabry-Perot (FP)
system at the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5-meter telescope. The aim of
these observations was to search for redshifted Ly-$\alpha$ emission from the
galaxies underlying the absorbers at $z = 2.3-2.5$ and their companion
galaxies. The 3 $\sigma$ sensitivity levels ranged between
  $1.9 \times 10^{-17}$ and $5.4 \times 10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in
observed-frame Ly-$\alpha$ flux. No significant Ly-$\alpha$ emitters were
detected at $> 3 \sigma$ level. The absence of significant Ly-$\alpha$ emission
implies limits on the star formation rate (SFR) of 0.9-2.7 $M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ per 2-pixel x 2-pixel region, if no dust attenuation is assumed. We
compare our results with those from other emission-line studies of absorber
fields and with predictions for global average SFR based on the models of
cosmic chemical evolution. Our limits are among the tightest existing
constraints on Ly-$\alpha$ emission from galaxies in absorber fields, but are
consistent with many other studies. In the absence of dust attenuation, these
studies suggest that SFRs in a large fraction of objects in the absorber fields
may lie below the global mean SFR. However, it is possible that dust
attenuation is responsible for the low emission line fluxes in some objects. It
is also possible that the star-forming regions are compact and at smaller
angular separations from the quasar than the width of our point spread function
and, get lost in the quasar emission. We outline future observations that could
help to distinguish between the various possibilities.

outflow efficiency, we reproduce both the current baryon fraction and the early
chemical enrichment of the IGM. The intensity of the formation rate of
``normal'' stars is also well constrained by the observations: it has to be
dominated by star formation in elliptical galaxies, except perhaps at very low
redshift. The fraction of baryons in stars is predicted as are also the type Ia
and II supernova event rates. Comparison with SN observations in the redshift
range z=0-2 allows us to set strong constraints on the time delay of type Ia
supernovae (a total delay of \sim 4 Gyr is required to fit the data), the lower
end of the mass range of the progenitors (2 - 8 M_odot) and the fraction of
white dwarfs that reproduce the type Ia supernova (about 1 per cent). The
intensity in the initial starburst of zero metallicity stars below 270 M_\odot
must be limited in order to avoid premature overenrichment of the IGM. Only
about 10 - 20 % of the metals present in the IGM at z = 0 have been produced by
population III stars at very high z. The remaining 80 - 90 % are ejected later
by galaxies forming normal stars, with a maximum outflow efficiency occurring
at a redshift of about 5. We conclude that 10^{-3} of the mass in baryons must
lie in first massive stars in order to produce enough ionizing photons to allow
early reionization of the IGM by z \sim 15.

including gravitational instabilities, spiral wave shocks, stellar compression,
and turbulence compression. Some of these persist in the far outer regions
where the column density is far below the threshold for instabilities, making
the outer disk cutoff somewhat gradual. We show that in a galaxy with a single
exponential gas profile the star formation rate can have a double exponential
with a shallow one in the inner part and a steep one in the outer part. Such
double exponentials have been observed recently in the broad-band intensity
profiles of spiral and dwarf Irregular galaxies. The break radius in our model
occurs slightly outside the threshold for instabilities provided the Mach
number for compressive motions remains of order unity to large radii. The ratio
of the break radius to the inner exponential scale length increases for higher
surface brightness disks because the unstable part extends further out. This is
also in agreement with observations. Galaxies with extended outer gas disks
that fall more slowly than a single exponential, such as 1/R, can have their
star formation rate scale approximately as a single exponential with radius,
even out to 10 disk scale lengths. Halpha profiles should drop much faster than
the star formation rate as a result of the rapidly decreasing ambient density.

candidates are now confirmed as SNe Ia, compared to 54% using the methods of
previous surveys. This is despite the comparatively high redshift of this
sample, where the median SN Ia redshift is z=0.81 (0.155 <= z <= 1.01). These
improvements were realized because we use the unprecedented color coverage and
lightcurve sampling of the SNLS to predict whether a candidate is an SN Ia and
estimate its redshift, before obtaining a spectrum, using a new technique
called the ""SN photo-z."" In addition, we have improved techniques for galaxy
subtraction and SN template chi^2 fitting, allowing us to identify candidates
even when they are only 15% as bright as the host galaxy. The largest
impediment to SN identification is found to be host galaxy contamination of the
spectrum -- when the SN was at least as bright as the underlying host galaxy
the target was identified more than 90% of the time. However, even SNe on
bright host galaxies can be easily identified in good seeing conditions. When
the image quality was better than 0.55 arcsec the candidate was identified 88%
of the time. Over the five-year course of the survey, using the selection
techniques presented here we will be able to add approximately 170 more

statistical accuracy and relative insensitivity against cosmic variance. As at
lower redshifts, we find that lower-mass galaxies show higher SSFRs than higher

sample. Furthermore, the highest mass galaxies contain the oldest stellar
populations at all redshifts, in principle agreement with the existence of
evolved, massive galaxies at 1 < z < 3. It is remarkable, however, that this

with such high sensitivity and resolution. Although we detect only one source,
the entire sample is very radio-quiet down to strong limits. GH10 was found to
have a radio power of 8.5 x 10^21 W/Hz, and a ratio R = f(6 cm)/f(4400 A) of
2.8. The 3 sigma upper limits for the remaining nondetections correspond to
radio powers from 3 x 10^20 to 8 x 10^21 W/Hz and 0.47 < R <9.9. Stacking all
nondetections yields an even stronger upper limit of R < 0.27. An assessment of
existing observations in the literature confirms our finding that NLS1s are
consistently radio-quiet, with a radio-loud fraction of 0%-6%, which is
significantly lower than the 10%-20% observed in the general quasar population.
By analogy with stellar-mass black holes, we argue that AGNs undergo a state
transition at L_bol/L_Edd~0.01. Below this value a radiatively inefficient
accretion flow effectively drives an outflow, which disappears when the flow
turns into an optically thick, geometrically thin disk, or a radiation
pressure-dominated slim disk at still higher L_bol/L_Edd.

active galactic nuclei is not established yet. The lack of small-scale
structure in the broad emission-line profiles is consistent with a smooth gas
flow, or a clumped flow with many small clouds. An attractive possibility for
the origin of many small clouds is the atmospheres of bloated stars, an origin
which also provides a natural mechanism for the cloud confinement. Earlier
studies of the broad-line profiles have already put strong lower limits on the
minimum number of such stars, but these limits are sensitive to the assumed
width of the lines produced by each cloud. Here we revisit this problem using
high-resolution Keck spectra of the H alpha line in NGC 4395, which has the
smallest known broad-line region (~10^14 cm). Only a handful of the required
bloated stars (each having r~10^14 cm) could fit into the broad-line region of
NGC 4395, yet the observed smoothness of the H alpha line implies a lower limit
of ~10^4-10^5 on the number of discrete clouds. This rules out conclusively the
bloated-stars scenario, regardless of any plausible line-broadening mechanisms.
The upper limit on the size of the clouds is ~10^12 cm, which is comparable to
the size implied by photoionization models. This strongly suggests that gas in
the broad-line region is structured as a smooth rather than a clumped flow,
most likely in a rotationally dominated thick disk-like configuration. However,
it remains to be clarified why such a smooth, gravity-dominated flow generates
double-peaked emission lines only in a small fraction of active galactic
nuclei.

maser decay with a composite computational model, comprising a time-dependent
chemical model of the envelope, and a radiation transfer model which provides
the maser pumping. Our combined model is able to reproduce the rapid decay of
maser intensity, following a sudden drop in the stellar mass-loss rate. The
explanation for the rapid fall in maser emission is not a fall in the OH number
density, or the kinetic temperature in the inverted layers, but the loss of a
radiative pump route which carries population from level 1 to level 4 via
levels 16, 15 and 11. The loss of these pump routes is a result, in turn, of a
greatly reduced energy density of 53 micron radiation.

the average electron temperature over the five day period. The radiative,
conductive, and mass flow losses were calculated and used to determine the
resultant heating rate (P_H). Radiative losses were found to dominate the
active region cooling process. As the region decayed, the heating rate
decreased by almost a factor of five between the first and last day of

has been the inherent structure mapping, which divides up the potential energy
landscape into basins of attraction surrounding the minima. Here, we probe the

distribution and applying it to some archetypal supercooled liquids. We find
that this probability distribution is a power law over a large number of
decades with the lower-energy minima having larger basins of attraction.
Interestingly, the exponent for this power law is approximately the same as
that for a high-dimensional Apollonian packing, providing further support for
the suggestion that there is a strong analogy between the way the energy
landscape is divided into basins, and the way that space is packed in
self-similar, space-filling hypersphere packings, such as the Apollonian
packing. These results suggest that the basins of attraction provide a
fractal-like tiling of the energy landscape, and that a scale-free pattern of
connections between the minima is a general property of energy landscapes.

underlying the superconducting phenomenon, the gap $\Delta_0$ and the
superfluid stiffness $D_S$, which controls the phase coherence. The BCS-BE
crossover is clearly mirrored in a change in the hierarchy of these two scales,
the smallest of the two controlling the critical temperature. In the whole
intermediate-to-strong coupling region $T_c$ scales with $D_S$, while $T_C$ is
proportional to $\Delta_0$ only in the BCS regime. This evolution as a function
of the interaction qualitatively resembles what happens in the cuprates when
the doping is decreased towards the Mott insulator.
  This continuous change reflects also in the energetic balance at the
superconducting transition. While superconductivity is stabilized by a
potential energy gain in the BCS regime, the strong-coupling superconductivity
is made stable by a reduction of kinetic energy. Interestingly the
intermediate-coupling region, where the maximum $T_c$ is achieved, behaves
similarly to the strong-coupling regime. The above finding implies that the
attractive Hubbard model can account qualitatively for the anomalous behavior
of optical spectra around $T_c$, where an increase of spectral weight is
observed in under and optimally doped cuprates, while the overdoped samples
have a more standard behavior. This qualitative agreement is lost in the normal
phase, specifically at strong-coupling, calling for the inclusion of strong
correlation effects in the theoretical description.

cooling procedure, and temperature. The value of the FORC distribution, rho, is
used as a measure of the extent of irreversible switching. For x < 0.18, the
small values of rho and its ridge-like distribution along local coercivity (Hc)
and zero bias (Hb), are characteristic of non-interacting single domain
particles. This is consistent with the formation of an array of isolated
nanoscopic ferromagnetic clusters, as observed in previous work. For x >= 0.18,
the much larger values of rho, the tilting of its distribution towards negative
bias field, and the emergence of regions with negative rho, are consistent with
increased long-range ferromagnetic ordering. The FORC distributions display
little dependence on the cooling procedure. With increasing temperature, the
fraction of irreversible switching determined from the FORC distribution
follows closely the ferromagnetic phase fraction measured by La nuclear
magnetic resonance. Our results furthermore demonstrate that the FORC method is

  The microscopic origin of condensation and phase separations","9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech astro-ph nucl-th",,"  Conventional thermo-statistics address infinite homogeneous systems within
the canonical ensemble. However, some 170 years ago the original motivation of
thermodynamics was the description of steam engines, i.e. boiling water. Its
essential physics is the separation of the gas phase from the liquid. Of
course, boiling water is inhomogeneous and as such cannot be treated by
conventional thermo-statistics. Then it is not astonishing, that a phase
transition of first order is signaled canonically by a Yang-Lee singularity.
Thus it is only treated correctly by microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck
statistics. This is elaborated in the present paper. It turns out that the
Boltzmann-Planck statistics is much richer and gives fundamental insight into
statistical mechanics and especially into entropy. This can be done to a far
extend rigorously and analytically. The deep and essential difference between
``extensive'' and ``intensive'' control parameters, i.e. microcanonical and
canonical statistics, is exemplified by rotating, self-gravitating systems. In
this paper the necessary appearance of a convex entropy $S(E)$ and the negative
heat capacity at phase separation in small as well macroscopic systems
independently of the range of the force is pointed out. The appearance of a
critical end-point for the liquid-gas transition in the $p-E$ or $V-E$ phase
diagram can be easily explained as well the non-existence of a critical
end-point of the solid-liquid transition.

treating nonequilibrium phenomena has been successfully used by Einstein and
Smoluchowski treating fluctuations. It will be argued, that due to the
reversibility of the microscopic equations, all processes - also macroscopic
ones - must at least in principle be reversible. Also, a clear conceptual
distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium states is not possible in
the Boltzmannian framework, which is just the reason why these concepts should
apply to nonequilibrium. In the present manuscript we derive a Fluctuation
Theorem from the equation S=k ln P, where P is the probability of a state. The
recently discovered Fluctuation Theorems are some of the few exact results
valid far from equilibrium. Two assumptions are needed for the derivation:
First, the process shall happen on certain time-scales that are large compared
with the time, during which the system memorizes its initial conditions.
Second, the entropy production rate averaged over all realizations of the
process shall be constant during the process. We will finally point out, why a
solution to the problem of macroscopic irreversibility invoking causality - as
it was recently suggested in connection with the Fluctuation Theorem - cannot
live up to its task.

close with two basic remarks. First, we establish a connection between the
abundance of scale-free networks in nature and the fact that power-law tails in
the degree distribution result only from (at least asymptotically) linear
preferential attachment: Only in the case of linear preferential attachment
does a minimum of topological knowledge about the network suffice for the

Given sensory data about an unknown object, classify the object by comparing
the sensory data with a library of internal representations stored in memory.
In many cases of interest, the number of patterns to be discriminated and the
richness of the raw data force recognition systems to internally represent
memory and sensory information in a compressed format. However, these
representations must preserve enough information to accommodate the variability
and complexity of the environment, or else recognition will be unreliable.
Thus, there is an intrinsic tradeoff between the amount of resources devoted to
data representation and the complexity of the environment in which a
recognition system may reliably operate.
  In this paper we describe a general mathematical model for pattern
recognition systems subject to resource constraints, and show how the
aforementioned resource-complexity tradeoff can be characterized in terms of
three rates related to number of bits available for representing memory and

N_f light quarks in the fundamental and adjoint representation. Universality
and renormalization-group (RG) arguments show that the possibility of having a
continuous transition is related to the existence of a stable fixed point (FP)
in the RG flow of a 3D Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Phi^4 theory with the same chiral
symmetry-breaking pattern. The RG flow of these theories is studied by
field-theoretical approaches, computing and analyzing high-order perturbative
series, up to six loops. According to this RG analysis, the transition in QCD
can be continuous only for N_f=2. In this case it belongs to the 3D O(4)
universality class. We also find a stable FP corresponding to a 3D universality
class with symmetry breaking U(2)_L x U(2)_R -> U(2)_V, which implies that the
transition can be continuous also if the axial-anomaly effects are suppressed
at Tc. In the case of quarks in the adjoint representation, we can have a
continuous transition for N_f=1,2. For N_f=1 it belongs to the O(3)
universality class. For N_f=2 it belongs to a new 3D universality class
characterized by the symmetry breaking SU(4)->SO(4).

scale $1/R_f$ is only weakly constrained by unitarity of the $t\bar{t}\to W^+

describe a game with nature. Godel`s incompleteness theorem is taken into
account to construct a model of logical networks based on axioms obtained by
symmetry breaking. We start by saying that although an agent is rational, the
axioms defining different agent's logic systems need not be the same although
they might have a large degree of overlap. This can be seen as each agent being
coupled to a higher dimensional world by means of his perception where the
couplings produce slightly different projections of the higher dimensional
world to each agent. The different projections would produce slightly different
concepts about the ""world"" to each agent and hence create a slightly differing
set of axioms that each agent would use to act logically. Then we place the
agents in an interacting logical network, where these axioms can be treated as
spins that can be flipped as agents interact with each other and with the
environment in which they are placed. Agents, who would share a common material
world that they wish to use or change by using different or conflicting sets of
axioms will try to flip the other agent's axioms (This can be seen by observing
that as one agent acts to interact with his world as followed by his axiom,
another agent's world changes as well, and the change might be contradictory to
the second agent's ""axioms"" or ""optimal world"". We define an equation that
allows an axiom to be flipped into an ""anti axiom (the opposite or conflicting
axiom)"" as agents interact. All agents share an ""existence"" axiom by means of
which they strive to perpetuate themselves or the network.

trigonometric Rosen-Morse potential reported in the literature rely upon the
Jacobi polynomials with complex indices and complex arguments. We first draw
attention to the fact that the complex Jacobi polynomials have non-trivial
orthogonality properties which make them uncomfortable for physics
applications. Instead we here solve above equation in terms of real orthogonal
polynomials. The new solutions are used in the construction of the
quantum-mechanic superpotential.

analyzed through a complete set of two-qubit local invariants. Collective
features of entanglement, such as spin squeezing, are expressed in terms of
invariants and a classifcation scheme for pairwise entanglement is proposed.
The invariant criteria given here are shown to be related to the recently
proposed (Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 120502 (2005)) generalized spin squeezing
inequalities for pairwise entanglement in symmetric multi-qubit states.
