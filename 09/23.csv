obtained by integrating the exact particle trajectories in a turbulent magnetic
field near the shock, with a few ``realistic'' features of the field structure
included. We show that the main acceleration process at oblique shocks is the
particle compression at the shock. Formation of energetic spectral tails is
possible in a limited energy range for highly perturbed magnetic fields.
Cut-offs in the spectra occur at low energies in the resonance range
considered. We relate this feature to the structure of the magnetic field
downstream of the shock, where field compression produces effectively 2D
turbulence in which cross-field diffusion is very small. Because of the field
compression downstream, the acceleration process is inefficient also in
parallel high-$\gamma$ shocks for larger turbulence amplitudes, and features
observed in oblique shocks are recovered. For small-amplitude perturbations,
particle spectra are formed in a wide energy range and modifications of the
acceleration process due to the existence of long-wave perturbations are
observed. The critical turbulence amplitude for efficient acceleration at
parallel shocks decreases with shock Lorentz factor. We also study the
influence of strong short-wave perturbations downstream of the shock on the
particle acceleration processes. The spectral indices obtained do not converge
to the ``universal'' value . Our results indicate inefficiency of the
first-order Fermi process to generate high-energy cosmic rays at
ultrarelativistic shocks with the considered perturbed magnetic field

Multiwavelength emission comming directly from these outflows is always
non-thermal in origin. This fact constitutes a primary difficulty in extracting
unknown parameters of large-scale jets, since the non-thermal featureless
continua do not allow to infer undoubtfully (or even at all) bulk velocities
and composition of the radiating plasma. In addition, arcsecond spatial
resolution, limited sensitivity and narrow energy bands of the best
high-frequency telescopes like Spitzer, Hubble and Chandra, preclude precise
constraints on the spectral and morphological properties of the discussed

enriched our knowledge on extragalactic large-scale jets, in many aspects,
however, by means of challenging previous predictions and expectations. In this

learned by analyzing broad-band emission of the discussed objects about

apparent star formation rates are, extremely high, 20-466 M_solar/year.
However, all or most of them are not likely to be galaxies at the absorption

In the fields of the other quasars, we detected no star-forming galaxies, nor
did we find any number excess of galaxy counts around them. This no-detection
results could be because the luminosities and star formation rates of galaxies
are lower than the detection limits of our observations (K' > 21 and SFR <

fields by chance. Otherwise, most C IV absorption lines could be ascribed not
to cluster of galaxies, but to isolated star forming pockets far from bright

pulsations disappeared while at higher energies they were shifted in phase. The
spectrum taken outside this low-intensity event was well fitted by an absorbed

bright inner ring and a set of ""arcs"" surrounded by fainter diffuse emission.

brighter interior ring of emission including a bright knot of emission. Overall
the emission of the SNR is well described by a thermal plasma of temperature
~0.6 keV. The Bright Knot, however, is spectrally distinct from the rest of the
SNR, requiring the addition of a high-energy spectral component consistent with
a power-law spectrum of photon index 1.6--1.8.
  We confirm the findings of Nishiuchi et al. (2001) that the spectra of these
shells are notably different, with Shell A requiring a high iron abundance for
a good spectral fit, implying a Type Ia origin. We further explicitly compare
abundance ratios to model predictions for Type Ia and Type II supernovae. The
low ratios for Shell A (O/Fe of 1.5 and Ne/Fe of 0.2) and the high ratios for
Shell B (O/Fe of 30--130 and Ne/Fe of 8--16) are consistent with Type Ia and

equilibria. Because the rate equations in nucleosynthetic applications involve
a wide range of timescales, implicit methods have proven mandatory, leading to
the need to solve matrix equations. Efforts to improve the performance of such
rate equation methods are focused on efficient solution of these matrix
equations, in particular by making best use of the sparseness of these
matrices, and finding methods that require less frequent matrix solutions.
Recent work to produce hybrid schemes which use local equilibria to reduce the

stage include a gravitationally unstable disc. Initially unstable gas-dust
discs may form planets directly, but the high surface density required has
motivated the alternative that gravitational instability occurs in a dust
sub-layer only after grains have grown large enough by electrostatic sticking.
Although such growth up to the instability stage is efficient for laminar
discs, concern has mounted as to whether realistic disc turbulence
catastrophically increases the settling time, thereby requiring additional
processes to facilitate planet formation on the needed time scales. To evaluate
this concern, we develop a model for grain growth that accounts for the
influence of turbulence on the collisional velocity of grains and on the scale
height of the dust layer. The relative effect on these quantities depends on
the grain size. The model produces a disc-radius dependent time scale to reach
a gravitationally unstable phase of planet formation. For a range of dust
sticking and disc parameters, we find that for viscosity parameters $\alpha \le
10^{-3}$, this time scale is short enough over a significant range in radii $R$
that turbulence does not catastrophically slow the early phases of planet
formation, even in the absence of agglomeration enhancement agents like
vortices.

population, it has been suggested that the defining optical spectral features

host galaxies, causing them to appear optically quiescent in deep surveys. We
test this possibility by artificially redshifting a sample of 23 nearby,

star, the scale parameter may have a value quite different from that used in
hadronic sector. To remove this discrepancy we introduced two scale parameters
in the potential, one for the asymptotic freedom part and the other for the
confining part. With suitable values of the parameters, this modified potential
has been successfully used in both baryonic property and strange star
calculations. The Equation of States obtained with the modified potential are
also used to obtain mass-radius relations for the strange stars.

that join high flux sensitivity with large field of view capability. GAW is
conceived as an array of three identical imaging telescopes disposed at the
vertexes of an equilateral triangle, about 80 m side. Two main features
characterize GAW with respect to all the existing and presently planned
ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. The first difference concerns the optics
system: GAW uses a Fresnel refractive lens (2.13 m diameter) as light collector
instead of classical reflective mirror. The second main difference is the
detection working mode used: the detector at the focal surface operates in
single photoelectron counting mode instead of the usual charge integration one.
The GAW array is planned to be located at the Calar Alto Observatory site,
Spain, 2150 m a.s.l. During its first phase, only 6x6 degrees of the focal
plane detector will be implemented; moving it along the field of view, the
sensitivity of the telescopes will be tested observing the Crab Nebula with
on-axis and off-axis pointing up to 20 deg and with energy threshold of 300 GeV
and energy peak of 700 GeV. As path-finder, GAW will also monitor the Very High
Energy activity of some flaring Blazars as well as will follow-up GLAST
detections at high energies. In a second phase, the focal plane will be
enlarged to cover a field of view of 24 deg (full); pointing along different
North-South directions, GAW would reach a survey of 360x60 degrees region of
the sky. GAW is a collaboration effort of Research Institutes in Italy,
Portugal and Spain.

evolution of Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We have so far obtained
near-infrared high-resolution ISAAC spectra of 53 local ULIRGs at several
merger timescales and 12 Palomar-Green QSOs (more than half of which are
IR-bright sources). We have extracted the stellar velocity dispersion and
rotational velocity along our slits to derive the kinematics of the merging
galaxies. These quantities enable us to answer the following questions about
the evolution of ULIRGs: 1) What are the progenitor mass ratios?, 2) How do the
stellar kinematics evolve?, and, 3) Is there a connection between ULIRGs and
QSOs? We find that the Ultraluminous phase is mainly triggered by mergers of
approximately equal mass galaxies, however, less violent minor mergers (of
progenitor mass ratio ~3:1) also exist in our sample. Dynamical heating of the
merging hosts is observed as the stellar systematic rotation decreases with
time in favour of the increase of random motions. The merger remnants, being
dispersion-dominated systems with non-negligible rotation, resemble elliptical
galaxies. Placing ULIRGs on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies shows
that they resemble intermediate-mass ellipticals. After the nuclear
coalescence, the black hole masses of ULIRGs, calculated from their relation to
the host dispersions, are of the order 10^7-10^8 M_sun. To investigate whether
ULIRGs go through a QSO phase during their evolution, we perform a similar
(preliminary) analysis of the IR-bright-QSO kinematics. We find that the
average dispersion of the IR-bright QSOs is similar to that of the ULIRG
remnants, indicating that evolutionary links between the two populations may
exist.

general, more massive disks are dominated by two-armed spiral modes. Disks with
lower mass, and with lower velocity dispersion are simultaneously unstable for
spiral modes with different numbers of arms, which results in a more
complicated pattern.

combined to a very high order wavefront correction system is required but not
sufficient to achieve the $10^{-10}$ contrast level needed for detecting an

correction system need to be calibrated and subtracted. In this paper, we
consider a general model including the dynamic phase aberrations downstream the
wavefront correction system, the static phase aberrations of the instrument and
some differential aberrations provided by the calibration unit. A rather
optimistic case of a filled circular pupil and of a perfect coronagraph is
elsewhere assumed. As a result of the analytical study, the limitation mostly
comes from the static aberrations. Using numerical simulations we confirm this
result and evaluate the requirements in terms of phase aberrations to detect
Earth-like planets on Extremely Large Telescopes.

efficiency during the first adiabatic stage of the acceleration process. The
underlying physical mechanism is identified as the dynamical MHD alignment of
the magnetic field with the electric current, which favours parallel
(resistive) electric fields responsible for initial injection. Conversely, the
alignment of the magnetic field with the bulk velocity weakens the acceleration
by convective electric fields $- \bfu \times \bfb$ at a non-adiabatic stage of
the acceleration process. We point out that non-physical parallel electric
fields in random-phase turbulence proxies lead to artificial acceleration, and
that the dynamical MHD alignment can be taken into account on the level of the
joint two-point function of the magnetic and electric fields, and is therefore
amenable to Fokker-Planck descriptions of stochastic acceleration.

disordered metal as measured in a weak localization experiment. If the density
n_S of magnetic impurities is sufficiently low, the dephasing rate 1/tau_phi is
a universal function, 1/tau_phi = (n_S/nu) f(T/T_K), where T_K is the Kondo
temperature and nu the density of states. We show that inelastic vertex
corrections with a typical energy transfer Delta E are suppressed by powers of
1/(tau_phi Delta E) proportional to n_S. Therefore the dephasing rate can be
calculated from the inelastic cross section proportional to pi nu Im T- |pi nu
T|^2, where T is the T-matrix which is evaluated numerically exactly using the
numerical renormalization group.

characteristic structure at the excision surface where some modes are not of
outflow-type with respect to any excision boundary chosen inside the horizon.
Thus, boundary conditions are required for these modes. Unfortunately, the
specification of these conditions is a delicate issue as the outflow modes
involve both gauge and main variables. As an alternative to these driver
equations, we examine conditions derived from extremizing a scalar constructed
from Killing's equation and present specific numerical examples.

for zero chemical potentials changes from a first order transition to a
crossover. We find that the Binder cumulants, used to determine the position of
this transition, have very strong dt dependence. This leads us to an estimate
of the critical mass which is about 20% below previous estimates. In addition,
when this dt dependence is taken into account, we find that the Binder
cumulants show very little dependence on mu_I. From this we conclude that we do
not as yet see any evidence for the expected critical endpoint. We have argued
previously that the position and nature of the finite temperature transition

quenched QCD, the sensitivity of the average plaquette to a removal of large

order 10 weak coupling series for the plaquette give robust indications for a
singularity in the third derivative of the free energy (second derivative of
the plaquette) with respect to beta, near beta = 5.7. We report results of
numerical calculations. The peak in the third derivative of the free energy
present on 4^4 lattices disappears if the size of the lattice is increased
isotropically up to a 10^4 lattice. On the other hand, on 4xL^3 lattices, it
persists when L increases. The location of the peak coincides with the onset of
a non-zero average for the Polyakov loop and seems related to the finite
temperature transition. We also discuss the discrepancy between the
perturbative series and the numerical values of the plaquette.

production rates and branching ratios for these states that are markedly
different from the standard model and are characteristic of a mirror world. The
constraints on these Higgs boson masses from precision electroweak data differ
from the standard model bound, so that the new physics that cancels the
quadratic divergence induced by the top quark may appear at a larger scale,
possibly beyond the reach of the LHC. However, the scale of new physics needed
to cancel the quadratic divergence induced by the Higgs boson is not
significantly changed. With small breakings of the Z_2 parity, the lightest
mirror quarks (and possibly charged mirror leptons) could be the dark matter in
the universe, forming galactic halos that are stable to cooling. A possible
signal from the relic radiation density of the mirror world is also discussed.

consider two classes of models. In one class supersymmetry breaking is
transmitted to the supersymmetric standard model sector through Dirac gaugino
mass terms generated by a D-term vacuum expectation value of a U(1) gauge
field. In the other class the supersymmetry breaking sector is separated from
the supersymmetric standard model sector in an extra dimension, and the
transmission of supersymmetry breaking occurs through gauge mediation. In both
these theories the Higgs sector contains two Higgs doublets and a singlet, but
unlike the case for the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model the
singlet field is not responsible for generating the supersymmetric or
supersymmetry breaking mass for the Higgs doublets. These masses, as well as
the mass for the singlet, are generated through gravitational-strength
interactions. The scale at which the squark and slepton masses are generated is
of order (1-100) TeV, and the generated masses do not respect the unified mass
relations. We find that electroweak symmetry breaking in these theories is
caused by an interplay between the top-stop radiative correction and the
holomorphic supersymmetry breaking mass for the Higgs doublets and that the
fine-tuning can be reduced to the level of 20%. The theories have rich
phenomenology, including a variety of possibilities for the lightest
supersymmetric particle.

supersymmetric or holomorphic supersymmetry-breaking masses for the Higgs
doublets. We find that this naturally leads to a deviation from the
conventional picture of top-Yukawa driven electroweak symmetry breaking --
electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the holomorphic supersymmetry
breaking mass for the Higgs doublets (the \mu B term). This allows a
significant improvement for fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking, since
the top squarks do not play a major role in raising the Higgs boson mass or in
triggering electroweak symmetry breaking and thus can be light. The amount of
fine-tuning is given by the squared ratio of the lightest Higgs boson mass to
the charged Higgs boson mass, which can be made better than 20%. Solid
implications of the scenario include a small value for tan\beta, less than
about 3, and relatively light top squarks.

potential is developed. A general class of separable backgrounds for both
single and two-brane systems is derived, where the bulk metric components are
given by products of world-volume and bulk coordinates and the world-volumes
represent any anisotropic and inhomogeneous solution to an effective
four-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory of gravity. We deduce a cosmic no hair
theorem for all ever expanding, spatially homogeneous Bianchi world-volumes and
find that the spatially flat and isotropic inflationary scaling solution
represents a late-time attractor when the bulk potential is sufficiently flat.
The dependence of this result on the separable nature of the bulk metric is
investigated by applying the techniques of Hamilton-Jacobi theory to
five-dimensional Einstein gravity. We employ the spatial gradient expansion
method to determine the asymptotic form of the bulk metric up to third-order in
spatial gradients. It is found that the condition for the separable form of the
metric to represent the attractor of the system is precisely the same as that
for the four-dimensional world-volume to isotropize. We also derive the
fourth-order contribution to the Hamilton-Jacobi generating functional.
Finally, we conclude by placing our results within the context of the
holographic approach to braneworld cosmology.

comparing fast moving strings to long single trace operators in gauge theories.
Such actions arise in two ways: as a limit of the string action and as a
description of long single trace field theory operators. They are
non-relativistic sigma models with the target space usually being a Kahler
manifold. They are non-renormalizable and need a cut-off in the wave-length. If
the total spin (or charge) contained in a minimal wavelength is large compared
to one, the system behaves approximately classically and an expansion in loops
is meaningful.
  In this paper we apply the renormalization group procedure to such actions
and find, at one-loop, that the Kahler potential flows in the infrared to a
Kahler-Einstein one.Therefore, in this context, the anomalous dimensions of
long operators are determined by a fixed point. This suggests that certain
features of the large N-limit might be independent of the detailed properties
of a gauge theory.

then at the {\em classical} level the effective action does not have the
required features for spontaneous Lorentz violation to occur asymptotically $(t
\to \infty)$ in an expanding FRW universe. Then we study the large $N$ limit of
a renormalizable field theory with a complex scalar coupled to massive
fermions. In this model an effective action for the Goldstone boson with the

Although the model has shortcomings, we feel it represents progress towards
finding a high energy completion for the Higgs phase of gravity.

Yang-Baxter equation. Its solutions define integrable three-dimensional lattice
models of statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Their integrability
is not related to the size of the lattice, therefore the same solution of the
tetrahedron equation defines different integrable models for different finite
periodic cubic lattices. Obviously, any such three-dimensional model can be
viewed as a two-dimensional integrable model on a square lattice, where the
additional third dimension is treated as an internal degree of freedom.
Therefore every solution of the tetrahedron equation provides an infinite
sequence of integrable 2d models differing by the size of this ""hidden third
dimension"". In this paper we construct a new solution of the tetrahedron
equation, which provides in this way the two-dimensional solvable models
related to finite-dimensional highest weight representations for all quantum
affine algebra $U_q(\hat{sl}(n))$, where the rank $n$ coincides with the size
of the hidden dimension. These models are related with an anisotropic
deformation of the $sl(n)$-invariant Heisenberg magnets. They were extensively
studied for a long time, but the hidden 3d structure was hitherto unknown. Our
results lead to a remarkable exact ""rank-size"" duality relation for the nested
Bethe Ansatz solution for these models. Note also, that the above solution of
the tetrahedron equation arises in the quantization of the ""resonant three-wave
scattering"" model, which is a well-known integrable classical system in 2+1

Universe in the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum model includes a dark (or

of the dark radiation is proportional to the black hole mass. We generalize
this result for an AdS bulk space with an arbitrary matter component. We show
that the mirage term retains its form, but the black hole mass is replaced by
the covariantly defined integrated mass of the bulk matter. As this mass
depends explicitly on the scale factor on the brane, the mirage term does not
scale as pure radiation. For low energy densities the brane cosmological
evolution is that of a four-dimensional Universe with two matter components:
the matter localized on the brane and the mirage matter. There is conservation
of energy between the two components. This behaviour indicates a duality
between the bulk theory and a four-dimensional theory on the brane. The
equation of state of the generalized dark radiation is that of a conformal
field theory, with an explicit breaking of the conformal invariance through the
pressure of the bulk fluid. Accelerated expansion on the brane is possible only
if there is negative pressure on the brane or in the bulk, or if the integrated
mass of the bulk fluid is negative.

  Stationary Case","26 pages. Updated versions --if any-- of this author's papers can be
  downloaded at http://www.pims.math.ca/~nassif",,,,"math.AP",,"  We analyze the nonlinear elliptic problem $\Delta u=\frac{\lambda
f(x)}{(1+u)^2}$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$ of $\R^N$ with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. This equation models a simple electrostatic Micro-Electromechanical
System (MEMS) device consisting of a thin dielectric elastic membrane with
boundary supported at 0 above a rigid ground plate located at -1. When a
voltage --represented here by $\lambda$-- is applied, the membrane deflects
towards the ground plate and a snap-through may occur when it exceeds a certain
critical value $\lambda^*$ (pull-in voltage). This creates a so-called ""pull-in
instability"" which greatly affects the design of many devices. The mathematical
model lends to a nonlinear parabolic problem for the dynamic deflection of the
elastic membrane which will be considered in forthcoming papers \cite{GG2} and
\cite{GG3}. For now, we focus on the stationary equation where the challenge is
to estimate $\lambda^*$ in terms of material properties of the membrane, which
can be fabricated with a spatially varying dielectric permittivity profile $f$.
Applying analytical and numerical techniques, the existence of $\lambda^*$ is
established together with rigorous bounds. We show the existence of at least
one steady-state when $\lambda < \lambda^*$ (and when $\lambda=\lambda^*$ in
dimension $N< 8$) while none is possible for $\lambda>\lambda^*$. More refined
properties of steady states --such as regularity, stability, uniqueness,
multiplicity, energy estimates and comparison results-- are shown to depend on
the dimension of the ambient space and on the permittivity profile.

central questions of universal algebraic geometry is: when two algebras have
the same algebraic geometry? For answer of this question (see [Pl],[Ts]) we
must consider the variety, to which our algebras belongs, the category K of all
finitely generated free algebras of our variety and research how the group of
all the automorphisms of this category AutK are different from the group of the
all inner automorphisms of this category InnK. An automorphism of the category
is called inner, if it is isomorphic as functor to the identity automorphism.
In the case when we consider a variety of all groups we have the classical
results which let us resolve this problem by an indirect way. In [DF] proved
that for every free group F the group Aut(AutF) coincides with the group
Inn(AutF), from this result in [Fo] was concluded that Aut(EndF)=Inn(EndF) and
from this fact by theorem of reduction [BPP] it can be concluded that
AutK=InnK. In the case of nilpotent group by [Ks] we have, that if the number
of generators of the free nilpotent class d group NF are bigger enough than d,
then Aut(AutNF)=Inn(AutNF). But we have no description of Aut(EndNF) and so can
not use the theorem of reduction. In this paper the method of verbal operations
is used. This method was established in [PZ]. In [PZ] by this method was very
easily proved that AutK=InnK in the case of free groups and in the case of free
abelian groups. In this paper we will prove, by this method, that AutK=InnK

constructed as a local time functional of a Levy process with no negative
jumps. We present a detailed study of the height process and of an associated
measure-valued process called the exploration process, which plays a key role
in most applications. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that whenever a
sequence of rescaled Galton-Watson processes converges in distribution, their
genealogies also converge to the continuous branching structure coded by the
appropriate height process. We apply this invariance principle to various
asymptotics for Galton-Watson trees. We then use the duality properties of the
exploration process to compute explicitly the distribution of the reduced tree
associated with Poissonnian marks in the height process, and the
finite-dimensional marginals of the so-called stable continuous tree. This last
calculation generalizes to the stable case a result of Aldous for the Brownian
continuum random tree. Finally, we combine the genealogical structure with an
independent spatial motion to develop a new approach to superprocesses with a
general branching mechanism. In this setting, we derive certain explicit

widths are a consequence of the strong interactions leading to a strongly
correlated many body system at the typical densities of nuclear matter.
Nevertheless ""traditional"" Brueckner calculations treat these states as
quasiparticles i.e. with spectral functions of zero widths. The width is
related to the imaginary part of the selfenergy and is included
selfconsistently in an extension of the Brueckner theory using T-matrix and
Green's function techniques. A more general formulation applicable also to
non-equilibrium systems is contained in the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations while
still maintaining the basic many-body techniques of Bruecknet theory. In the
present work the two-time KB-equations are time-stepped along the imaginary
time-axis to calculate the binding energy of nuclear matter as a function of
density, including the spectral widths self-consistently. These zero
temperature calculations are compared with quasi-particle calculations. The
inclusion of the self-consistent widths are found to add several MeV to the
binding. The spectral widths are due to the long-ranged correlations.
Short-ranged correlations decrease rather than increase the binding. The metod
is easily extended to non-zero temperatures where the importance of the widths
are expected to increase.

where rational choice is a poor empirical model, it has so far failed to
provide quantitative models of economic problems such as price formation. We
make a step in this direction by developing empirical models that capture
behavioral regularities in trading order placement and cancellation using data
from the London Stock Exchange. For order placement we show that the
probability of placing an order at a given price is well approximated by a
Student distribution with less than two degrees of freedom, centered on the
best quoted price. This result is surprising because it implies that trading
order placement is symmetric, independent of the bid-ask spread, and the same
for buying and selling. We also develop a crude but simple cancellation model
that depends on the position of an order relative to the best price and the
imbalance between buying and selling orders in the limit order book. These
results are combined to construct a stochastic representative agent model, in
which the orders and cancellations are described in terms of conditional
probability distributions. This model is used to simulate price formation and
the results are compared to real data from the London Stock Exchange. Without
adjusting any parameters based on price data, the model produces good
predictions for the magnitude and functional form of the distribution of
returns and the bid-ask spread.

Our results strongly suggest that the montium P neogenes are not recruited to
down regulate the P element transposition. Given that all the proteins encoded

the DNA Binding Domain, we tested the capacity of the RLs proteins to bind DNA
in vivo. Immunstaining of polytene chromosomes in D. melanogaster transgenic
lines strongly suggest that montium P neogenes encode proteins that bind DNA in

N-photon entanglement generation through a generalised N X N symmetric beam
splitter known as the Bell multiport. A wide variety of 4-photon entangled
states as well as the N-photon W-state can be generated with an unexpected
non-monotonic decreasing probability of success with N. We also show how the
same setup can be used to generate multiatom entanglement. A further study of
multiports also leads us to a multiparticle generalisation of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip which holds for all Bell multiports of even number of input
ports. Next, we demonstrate a generalised linear optics based photon filter
that has a constant success probability regardless of the number of photons
involved. This filter has the highest reported success probability and is
interferometrically robust. Finally, we demonstrate how repeat-until-success
quantum computing can be performed with two distant nodes with unit success
probability using only linear optics resource. We further show that using
non-identical photon sources, robustness can still be achieved, an illustration
of the nature and advantages of measurement-based quantum computation. A direct
application to the same setup leads naturally to arbitrary multiphoton state
generation on demand. Finally, we demonstrate how polarisation entanglement of
photons can be detected from the emission of two atoms in a Young's double-slit
type experiment without linear optics, resulting in both atoms being also
maximally entangled.

perfectly encrypt n bits (one-time pad). Even if we allow the encryption to be
approximate, the amount of entropy needed doesn't asymptotically change.
However, this is not the case when we are encrypting quantum bits. For the
perfect encryption of n quantum bits, 2n bits of entropy are necessary and
sufficient (quantum one-time pad), but for approximate encryption one
asymptotically needs only n bits of entropy. In this paper, we provide the
optimal trade-off between the approximation measure epsilon and the amount of
classical entropy used in the encryption of single quantum bits. Then, we
consider n-qubit encryption schemes which are a composition of independent
single-qubit ones and provide the optimal schemes both in the 2- and the
operator-norm. Moreover, we provide a counterexample to show that the
encryption scheme of Ambainis-Smith based on small-bias sets does not work in
the operator-norm.

pure state without the use of unitary transformations. This is achieved with
the help of sequential measurements of two non-commuting observables only. We
show that the overall success probability is maximized in the case of measuring
two observables whose eigenstates define mutually unbiased bases. We find that
for this optimal case the success probability quickly converges to unity as the
number of measurement processes increases and that it is almost independent of
the initial state. In particular, we show that to guarantee a success
probability close to one the number of consecutive measurements must be larger
than the dimension of the Hilbert space. We connect these results to quantum
copying, quantum deleting and entanglement generation.

systems subject to decoherence. Classical states are expected to be stable in
spite of decoherence, and are thought to leave conspicuous imprints on the
environment. Here these expected features of environment-induced superselection
(einselection) are quantified using four different criteria: predictability
sieve (which selects states that produce least entropy), purification time
(which looks for states that are the easiest to find out from the imprint they
leave on the environment), efficiency threshold (which finds states that can be
deduced from measurements on a smallest fraction of the environment), and
purity loss time (that looks for states for which it takes the longest to lose
a set fraction of their initial purity). We show that when pointer states --
the most predictable states of an open quantum system selected by the
predictability sieve -- are well defined, all four criteria agree that they are
indeed the most classical states. We illustrate this with two examples: an
underdamped harmonic oscillator, for which coherent states are unanimously
chosen by all criteria, and a free particle undergoing quantum Brownian motion,
for which most criteria select almost identical Gaussian states (although, in
this case, predictability sieve does not select well defined pointer states.)
