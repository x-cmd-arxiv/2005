radiation are confusing for standard cosmology. Remarkably, this fact has been
predicted several years ago in the framework of our model of the physical
world. Moreover, in exact agreement with our prediction the CMB has a preferred
direction towards the Virgo Cluster. The transpired structure of the CMB shows
workings of the suggested model of the physical world. Comprising the
information processes of Nature, this model presents a high-tech version of the
previous low-tech developments for mechanical ether and quantum vacuum. In the
current model, the phenomenon of Life turns up as a collective effect on the
""Internet of the Physical Universe"" using DNA structures for access codes. Most
convincingly, this construction points to a harmful analogy with so-called
""identity theft"" - improper manipulations with DNA of individual organisms can
destroy these organisms from a remote location without any physical contact.
Appearing incredible, such a possibility creates a superlative Experimentum
Crucis. In a broad sense, this surmised biological effect is intimately related
to the cosmological prediction of the structurization of the CMB, but it is
more compelling.

characterized by the one-parameter family of the stellar models. Especially,
the stellar polytropic distribution satisfying the effective equation of state

two unit telescopes (UT2 and UT3) with projected baseline lengths ranging from
39 to 47 m. Our observations of IRAS08002-3803 have spatially resolved the
dusty environment of a silicate carbon star for the first time and revealed an
unexpected wavelength dependence of the angular size in the N band: the
uniform-disk diameter is found to be constant and ~36 mas (72 Rstar) between 8

mas (106 Rstar) at 13 micron. Model calculations with our Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code show that neither spherical shell models nor axisymmetric disk
models consisting of silicate grains alone can simultaneously explain the
observed wavelength dependence of the visibility and the spectral energy
distribution (SED). We propose that the circumstellar environment of
IRAS08002-3803 may consist of two grain species coexisting in the disk:
silicate and a second grain species, for which we consider amorphous carbon,
large silicate grains, and metallic iron grains. Comparison of the observed
visibilities and SED with our models shows that such disk models can fairly --
though not entirely satisfactorily -- reproduce the observed SED and N-band
visibilities. Our MIDI observations and the radiative transfer calculations
lend support to the picture where oxygen-rich material around IRAS08002-3803 is
stored in a circumbinary disk surrounding the carbon-rich primary star and its

different phases. With these details we simulate the interactions between the
wind and the interstellar medium to predict the circumstellar environment
around the stars at the time of core-collapse. We then investigate how the
structure of the environment might affect the GRB afterglow. We find that when
the afterglow jet encounters the free-wind to stalled-wind interface that
rebrightening occurs and a bump is seen in the afterglow light curve. However
our predicted positions of this interface are too distant from the site of the
GRB to reach while the afterglow remains observable. The values of the
final-wind density, A_{*}, from our stellar models are similar to the values
inferred from observed afterglow lightcurves and those from observed Wolf-Rayet
stars. However we do not reproduce the lowest observed A_{*} values below 0.3.
For these cases we suggest that the progenitors could have been a WO type
Wolf-Rayet star, be in a close binary or very low metallicity star. Finally we
turn our attention to the matter of stellar wind material producing absorption
lines in the afterglow spectra. We discuss the observational signatures of two
Wolf-Rayet stellar types, WC and WO, in the afterglow lightcurve and spectra.

of the dark matter particles, as in the conventional picture. Instead, it is
reduced by a factor that quantifies the dependence of the dark matter mass on
the scalar field. This has implications for dark matter searches. We derive new
solutions of the Einstein equations which describe compact objects composed of

we demonstrate that a symmetry breaking takes place: we can observe it by
analyzing the splitting of the levels belonging to an unperturbed multiplet. We
also discuss the competitive effects of the magnetic field, the SO perturbation

attractive short range interactions exhibit ordered lamellar phases at low
temperatures. In the strong segregation limit the state of these systems can be
described by the location of the interfaces between the components. It has
previously been shown that these systems are stable against small deformations
of the interfaces. We examine their stability in the presence of a uniform
electric field. When the field is perpendicular to the lamellae, the system is
unstable against long wavelength deformations for all non-zero values of the
external field. A field parallel to the lamellae produces deformed but
persistent interfaces. In a finite thickness system, onset of an external
perpendicular field modifies the ground state. Flow between the old and new
ground states requires the destruction of the original interfaces; this
destruction proceeds through the instabilities identified in the bulk case. We
examine the possibility of dynamical stabilization of structures by means of
oscillating fields.

an effective, two-dimensional perspective, in which the membrane is treated as

we investigate the lowest 4Q state in the spatial periodic boundary condition,
and find that it is just a scattering state of two pseudoscalar mesons, as is
expected. Third, to extract spatially-localized 4Q resonances, we use the
Hybrid Boundary Condition (HBC) method, where anti-periodic and periodic
boundary conditions are imposed on quarks ($c$,$u$) and antiquarks ($\bar
s$,$\bar d$), respectively. By applying the HBC on a finite-volume lattice, the
threshold of the two-meson scattering state is raised up, while the mass of a
compact 4Q resonance is almost unchanged. In HBC, we find a nontrivial 4Q
resonance state about 100 MeV below the two-meson threshold in some quark-mass
region. Its chiral behavior largely differs from a two-meson scattering state.
The scalar tetraquark $f_0(ud\bar u\bar d)$ is found to have the mass of about
1.1GeV after chiral extrapolation, and seems to correspond to $f_0(980)$. Then,
the manifestly exotic tetraquark D$_{\rm s0}^{++}(cu\bar s \bar d)$ would exist
around 1GeV in the idealized SU(4)$_f$ chiral limit. Finally, MEM analysis is
applied to obtain the spectral function of the 4Q system.

0.122 fm, with a fixed physical volume $(2.0 fm)^3$. We present analysis for
the light meson spectrum and quark masses in the continuum limit, which are
determined using data obtained from the simulations at the two coarser

Unlike in other recent studies, we include both a thermal contribution to its

neutralino or stau decays after freeze--out. Relative to a previous analysis
[1] we update, extend and considerably improve our treatment of constraints
from observed light element abundances on additional energy released during BBN
in association with late gravitino production. Assuming the gravitino mass in
the GeV to TeV range, and for natural ranges of other supersymmetric
parameters, the neutralino region is excluded, while for smaller values of the
gravitino mass it becomes allowed again. The gravitino relic abundance is
consistent with observational constraints on cold dark matter from BBN and CMB
in some well defined domains of the stau region but, in most cases, only due to
a dominant contribution of the thermal population. This implies, depending on
the gravitino mass, a large enough reheating temperature. If $\mgravitino>1$
GeV then $T_R>10^7$ GeV, if allowed by BBN and other constraints but, for light
gravitinos, if $\mgravitino>100$ keV then $T_R>3\times 10^3$ GeV. On the other
hand, constraints mostly from BBN imply an upper bound $T_R \lsim {a few}x
10^8\times10^9$ GeV which appears inconsistent with thermal leptogenesis.
Finally, most of the preferred stau region corresponds to the physical vacuum
being a false vacuum. The scenario can be partially probed at the LHC.

encode information about its range on \C[x] and \R[x]. These {\it moment

multiplicative distance function and demonstrate a great deal of arithmetic

Mahler's measure restricted to real reciprocal polynomials of degree 2N has an
analytic continuation to rational functions with rational coefficients, simple
poles at integers between -N and N, and a zero of multiplicity 2N at the
origin. This discovery leads to asymptotic estimates for the number of
reciprocal integer polynomials of fixed degree with Mahler measure less than T
as $T \to \infty$. To explain the structure of this moment functions we show
that the real moment functions of a multiplicative distance function can be
written as Pfaffians of antisymmetric matrices formed from a skew-symmetric

that the widths of narrow proton resonances are related to neutron Asymptotic
Normalization Coefficients (ANCs) of their bound mirror analogs because of
charge symmetry of nucleon-nucleon interactions.
  This relation is approximated by a simple analytical formula which involves
proton resonance energies, neutron separation energies, charges of residual
nuclei and the range of their strong interaction with the last nucleon. In the
present paper, we perform microscopic-cluster model calculations for the ratio
of proton widths to neutron ANCs squared in mirror states for several light
nuclei. We compare them to predictions of the analytical formula and to
estimates made within a single-particle potential model. A knowledge of this
ratio can be used to predict unknown proton widths for very narrow low-lying
resonances in the neutron-deficient region of the $sd$- and $pf$-shells, which
is important for understanding the nucleosynthesis in the $rp$-process.

gravities and GR, as described in our previous works, in order to highlight its
important achievements. Amongst which are presentation of an easy
classification of higher order Lagrangians and its employment as a
\emph{criteria} in order to distinguish correct metric theories of gravity. For
example, it does not permit the inclusion of only one of the second order
Lagrangians in \emph{isolation}. But, it does allow the inclusion of the
cosmological term. We also discuss on the compatibility of our procedure and
the Mach idea. We derive a dimensional dependent version of Duff's trace
anomaly relation, which in \emph{four}-dimension is the same as the usual Duff
relation. The Lanczos Lagrangian satisfies this new constraint in \emph{any}
dimension. The square of the Weyl tensor identically satisfies it independent
of dimension, however, this Lagrangian satisfies the previous relation only in
three and four dimensions.

al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 183201 (2003)] for the case of two 133Cs atoms,
trapped in separated wells of a polarization-gradient optical lattice, and
interacting through a multichannel scattering process. Due to the anomalously
large scattering length of cesium dimers, a strong coupling can occur between
vibrational states of the trap and a weakly bound molecular state that is made
resonant by the ac-Stark shift of the lattice. We calculate the energy spectrum
of the two-atom system as a function of the distance between two potential
wells by connecting the solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the
short-range molecular potential to that of the long-range trap in a
self-consistent manner. The short-range potential is treated through a
multichannel pseudopotential, parametrized by the K matrix, calculated
numerically for atoms in free space in a close-coupling approximation. This
captures both the bound molecular spectrum as well as the energy-dependent
scattering for all partial waves. We establish realistic operating conditions
under which the trap-induced resonance could be observed and show that this
strong and coherent interaction could be used as a basis for high-fidelity
two-qubit quantum logic operations.

cohesive state arising from (colossal) Van-der-Waals attraction between highly

general suggestions but propose that the colossal Van-der-Waals coupling may
also arise from the enhanced polarizability of surrogate molecular clusters,
due to the polaron gap narrowing effect. We consider a few illuminating cases
and present calculations for the ammonia molecule. Although being unable to
identify the exact nature of the surrogate molecules at least for the
time-being, we suggest a general scenario of photoexcited vibronic excitons
forming a supersaturated surrogate gas phase in which a ball arises as a result
of condensation. The orange color of the luminous ball is due to radiative
exciton deexcitation and suggests that there may be a unique surrogate material
for ball lightning.

theories with particle trajectories) is different from that in orthodox quantum
theory. More precisely, there are two concepts of superselection rule, a weak
and a strong one. Weak superselection rules exist both in orthodox quantum
theory and in Bohm-Bell theories and represent the conventional understanding
of superselection rules. We introduce the concept of strong superselection
rule, which does not exist in orthodox quantum theory. It relies on the clear
ontology of Bohm-Bell theories and is a sharper and, in the Bohm-Bell context,
more fundamental notion. A strong superselection rule for the observable G
asserts that one can replace every state vector by a suitable statistical
mixture of eigenvectors of G without changing the particle trajectories or
their probabilities. A weak superselection rule asserts that every state vector
is empirically indistinguishable from a suitable statistical mixture of
eigenvectors of G. We establish conditions on G for both kinds of
superselection. For comparison, we also consider both kinds of superselection
in theories of spontaneous wave function collapse.
