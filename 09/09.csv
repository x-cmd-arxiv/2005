diagrams from the Fabry-Perot data cube as well as a CO 2-1 data cube from the
literature. PV diagrams constructed parallel to the major axis are used to
examine changes in azimuthal velocity as a function of height above the
midplane. The results of this analysis reveal the presence of a vertical
gradient in azimuthal velocity. The magnitude of this gradient is approximately
1 km/s/arcsec, or about 8 km/s/kpc, though a higher value of the gradient may
be appropriate in localized regions of the halo. The evidence for an azimuthal
velocity gradient is much stronger for the approaching half of the galaxy,
although earlier slit spectra are consistent with a gradient on both sides.
There is evidence for an outward radial redistribution of gas in the halo. The
form of the rotation curve may also change with height, but this is not
certain. We compare these results with those of an entirely ballistic model of
a disk-halo flow. The model predicts a vertical gradient in azimuthal velocity
which is shallower than the observed gradient, indicating that an additional
mechanism is required to further slow the rotation speeds in the halo.

that the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also

by shock waves can be significantly reduced. This creates the possibility of
particle acceleration beyond the knee energy at ~10^15eV. The acceleration
results from a nonlinear modification of the flow ahead of the shock supported
by particles already accelerated to the knee momentum at p ~ p_*. The particles
gain energy by bouncing off converging magnetic irregularities frozen into the
flow in the shock precursor and not so much by re-crossing the shock itself.
The acceleration rate is thus determined by the gradient of the flow velocity
and turns out to be formally independent of the particle mean free path
(m.f.p.). The velocity gradient is, in turn, set by the knee-particles at p ~
p_* as having the dominant contribution to the CR pressure. Since it is
independent of the m.f.p., the acceleration rate of particles above the knee
does not decrease with energy, unlike in the linear acceleration regime. The
reason for the knee formation at p ~ p_* is that particles with $p > p_*$ are
effectively confined to the shock precursor only while they are within limited
domains in the momentum space, while other particles fall into
``loss-islands'', similar to the ``loss-cone'' of magnetic traps. This
structure of the momentum space is due to the character of the scattering
magnetic irregularities. They are formed by a train of shock waves that
naturally emerge from unstably growing and steepening magnetosonic waves or as
a result of acoustic instability of the CR precursor. These losses steepen the
spectrum above the knee, which also prevents the shock width from increasing
with the maximum particle energy.

Embarrassingly, as far as the very metal-poor regime is concerned, a marked
discordance is observed between the [S/Fe] values from these two abundance
indicators, in the sense that the former attains a nearly flat plateau (or even
a slight downward bending) while the latter shows an ever-increasing trend with
a further lowering of metallicity. The reason for this discrepancy is yet to be
clarified. Regarding Zn, we almost confirmed the characteristic tendencies of
[Zn/Fe] reported from recent LTE studies (i.e., an evident/slight increase of
[Zn/Fe] with a decrease of [Fe/H] for very metal-poor/disk stars), since the
non-LTE corrections for the Zn I 4722/4810 and 6362 lines (tending to be
positive and gradually increasing towards lower [Fe/H]) are quantitatively of
less significance (<~ 0.1 dex).

of objects and self-lensing by LMC stars. We have carried out extensive
simulations, based upon data obtained during the first year of the project, to
assess the SuperMACHO survey's ability to discriminate between these two
scenarios. We find that the event rate itself shows significant sensitivity to
the choice of the LMC luminosity function, limiting the conclusions which can
be drawn from the absolute rate. If instead we determine the differential event
rate across the LMC, we will decrease the impact of these systematic biases and
render our conclusions more robust. With this approach the SuperMACHO Project
should be able to distinguish between the two categories of lens populations.
This will provide important constraints on the nature of the lensing objects
and their contributions to the Galactic dark matter halo.

emission line which we tentatively identify with Halpha. The galaxy
luminosities for the latter two objects are an order of magnitude brighter than
typical local L* galaxies and the derived stellar masses are well in excess of
10^11 Msun. For these objects we estimate black hole masses higher than 10^9

discuss the implications of these findings for the coevolution of galaxies and
black hole growth. Our results provide further support that X-ray sources with

H$\alpha$, and I band imaging. Correcting the observed colours of the star
clusters within the complexes for extinction, measured through our optical
spectra, we compare the clusters with simple stellar population models, with
which we find an excellent agreement. In five of the complexes we detect strong
Wolf-Rayet emission features, indicating young ages (3-5 Myr). The ionized gas
surrounding the complexes is expanding at speeds of 20-40 km/s. This slow
expansion can be understood as a bubble, caused by the stellar winds and
supernovae within the complexes, expanding into the remnant of the progenitor
giant molecular cloud. We also find that the complexes themselves are grouped,
at about the largest scale of which young star clusters are correlated,
representing the largest coherent star forming region. We show that the area
normalized star formation rates of these complexes clearly place them in the
regime of star forming regions in starburst galaxies, thereby justifying the
label of localized starbursts. Finally, we estimate the stability of the
complexes, and find that they will probably loose a large fraction of their
mass to the surrounding environment, although the central regions may merge

binary mixtures of hard rods of different lengths and diameters. Previous
studies have shown a strong tendency of smectic phases of these mixtures to
segregate and, in some circumstances, to form microsegregated phases. Our focus
in the present work is on the formation of columnar phases which some studies,
under some approximations, have shown to become thermodynamically stable prior
to crystallization. Specifically we focus on the relative stability between
smectic and columnar phases, a question not fully addressed in previous work.
Our analysis is based on two complementary perspectives: on the one hand, an
extended Onsager theory, which includes the full orientational degrees of
freedom but with spatial and orientational correlations being treated in an
approximate manner; on the other hand, we formulate a Zwanzig approximation of
fundamental-measure theory on hard parallelepipeds, whereby orientations are
restricted to be only along three mutually orthogonal axes, but correlations
are faithfully represented. In the latter case novel, complete phase diagrams
containing regions of stability of liquid-crystalline phases are calculated.
Our findings indicate that the restricted-orientation approximation enhances
the stability of columnar phases so as to preempt smectic order completely
while, in the framework of the extended Onsager model, with full orientational
degrees of freedom taken into account, columnar phases may preempt a large
region of smectic stability in some mixtures, but some smectic order still
persists.

lipid membranes without explicit solvent. Lipids are represented by one
head-bead and two tail-beads, with the interaction between tails being of key
importance in stabilizing the fluid phase. Two such tail-tail potentials were
tested, with the important feature in both cases being a variable range of
attraction. We examined phase diagrams of this range versus temperature for
both functional forms of the tail-tail attraction and found that a certain
threshold attractive width was required to stabilize the fluid phase. Within
the fluid phase region we find that material properties such as area per lipid,
orientational order, diffusion constant, inter-leaflet flip-flop rate and
bilayer stiffness all depend strongly and monotonically on the attractive
width. For three particular values of the potential width we investigate the
transition between gel and fluid phases via heating or cooling and find that
this transition is discontinuous with considerable hysteresis. We also
investigated the stretching of a bilayer to eventually form a pore and found
excellent agreement with a recently published analytic theory.

decreasing volume on warming and, unlike most materials, the
thermally-compressed solid softens. Does ZrW2O8 also soften when pressure alone
is applied? Using pulse-echo ultrasound in a hydrostatic SiC anvil cell, we
determine the elastic tensor of monocrystalline ZrW2O8 near 300 K as a function

Our results are inconsistent with conventional lattice dynamics, but do show
that the thermodynamically-complete constrained-lattice model can relate NTE to
elastic softening as increases in either temperature or pressure reduce volume,
establishing the predictive power of the model, and making it an important

soft dynamic), while in the TDA such factorization is not possible (a hard
dynamic). In full agreement with previous general theoretical results we find
that the local interface width under the TDA increases dramatically with the
applied force. In contrast, the interface structure with the OSD is only weakly
influenced by the force, in qualitative agreement with the theoretical
expectations. Results are also obtained for the force-dependence and anisotropy

the theoretical expectations for the differences between soft and hard

all obey detailed balance and the same conservation laws nevertheless can lead
to radically different interface responses to an applied force.

thermodynamics was the description of steam engines, i.e. boiling water. Its
essential physics is the separation of the gas phase from the liquid. Of
course, boiling water is inhomogeneous and as such cannot be treated by
conventional thermo-statistics. Then it is not astonishing, that a phase
transition of first order is signaled canonically by a Yang-Lee singularity.
Thus it is only treated correctly by microcanonical Boltzmann-Planck
statistics. This was elaborated in the talk presented at this conference. It
turns out that the Boltzmann-Planck statistics is much richer and gives
fundamental insight into statistical mechanics and especially into entropy.
This can be done to a far extend rigorously and analytically. The deep and
essential difference between ``extensive'' and ``intensive'' control
parameters, i.e. microcanonical and canonical statistics, was exemplified by
rotating, self-gravitating systems. In the present paper the necessary
appearance of a convex entropy $S(E)$ and the negative heat capacity at phase

distribution is obtained from a thicker-ring initial state. For those
quasi-stationary states, density distribution and macroscopic observables are
defined on the basis of a coarse-grained density field. We compare our results
with experiments and some statistical theories, which include the
Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, Tsallis statistics, the fluid entropy theory, and
the minimum enstrophy state. From some of those initial states, we obtain the
quasi-stationary states which are close to the minimum enstrophy state, but we

the initial states have the same energy and angular momentum, which means the

relaxations in glassy materials may be activated processes involving chains of
molecular displacements. As pointed out in a preceding paper with A. Lemaitre,
the entropy of critically long excitation chains can enable them to grow
without bound, thus activating stable thermal fluctuations in the local density
or molecular coordination of the material. I argue here that the intrinsic
molecular-scale disorder in a glass plays an essential role in determining the
activation rate for such chains, and show that a simple disorder-related
correction to the earlier theory recovers the Vogel-Fulcher law in three
dimensions. A key feature of this theory is that the spatial extent of
critically long excitation chains diverges at the Vogel-Fulcher temperature. I
speculate that this diverging length scale implies that, as the temperature
decreases, increasingly large regions of the system become frozen and do not
contribute to the configurational entropy, and thus ergodicity is partially
broken in the super-Arrhenius region above the Kauzmann temperature $T_K$. This
partially broken ergodicity seems to explain the vanishing entropy at $T_K$ and
other observed relations between dynamics and thermodynamics at the glass
transition.

of aggregates in the context of logic programming. In our study, an aggregate
can be an arbitrary interpreted second order predicate or function. We define
extensions of the Kripke-Kleene, the well-founded and the stable semantics for
aggregate programs. The semantics is based on the concept of a three-valued
immediate consequence operator of an aggregate program. Such an operator
approximates the standard two-valued immediate consequence operator of the
program, and induces a unique Kripke-Kleene model, a unique well-founded model
and a collection of stable models. We study different ways of defining such
operators and thus obtain a framework of semantics, offering different
trade-offs between precision and tractability. In particular, we investigate
conditions on the operator that guarantee that the computation of the three
types of semantics remains on the same level as for logic programs without
aggregates. Other results show that, in practice, even efficient three-valued
immediate consequence operators which are very low in the precision hierarchy,
still provide optimal precision.

factorization of scales (which is inherent to QCD and asymptotic freedom) and
jeopardizes the convergence of the perturbative expansion and the accurate
determination of power-suppressed corrections. This problem is more acute for
physical systems composed by one or more heavy quarks. In lattice regulations,
it reflects on the appearance of power-like divergences in the inverse of the
lattice spacing for a series of quantities ($\bar \Lambda$, gluelump masses,
the singlet and hybrid potentials, ...) making that the continuum limit can not
be reached for them. Nevertheless, all these problems are solved within the
framework of effective field theories with renormalon substraction. This allows
us to obtain convergent perturbative series and to unambiguously define power
corrections. In particular, one can connect with lattice results. Remarkably
enough the dependence on the lattice spacing can be predicted by perturbation
theory. This framework has been applied to the prediction of the gluelump
masses and the singlet and octet (hybrid) potentials at short distances, as

modifying the original lagrangian, it preserves symmetries under non-Abelian
gauge and Poincare transformations in spite of the existence of two intrinsic
mass scales $M_c$ and $\mu_s$ which actually play the roles of UV- and IR-cut
off respectively. The axialvector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle diagrams in
massless and massive QED are evaluated explicitly by using the loop
regularization. It is shown that when the momentum $k$ of external state is
soft with $k^2 \ll \mu_s^2, m^2 $ ($m$ is the mass of loop fermions) and $ M_c
\to \infty$, both massless and massive QED become anomaly free. The triangle
anomaly is found to appear as quantum corrections in the case that $ m^2,
\mu_s^2 \ll k^2 $ and $M_c \to \infty$. Especially, it is justified that in the
massless QED with $\mu_s =0$ and $M_c\to \infty$, the triangle anomaly
naturally exists as quantum effects in the axial-vector current when the
ambiguity caused by the trace of gamma matrices with $\gamma_5$ is eliminated
by simply using the definition of $\gamma_5$. It is explicitly demonstrated how
the Ward identity anomaly of currents depends on the treatment for the trace of
gamma matrices, which enables us to make a clarification whether the ambiguity
of triangle anomaly is caused by the regularization scheme in the perturbation
calculations or by the trace of gamma matrices with $\gamma_5$.

structures that go beyond the usual \Gamma_{MN} of the Riemannian connection.
In this paper we investigate the generalisations to the usual Riemannian

string or M-theory corrections in the supercovariant derivative. Even in the
absence of background form fields, these corrections introduce additional terms
\Gamma_{M_1... M_6} in the supercovariant connection, and hence they lead to
enlarged structure and holonomy groups. In some cases, the corrected equations
of motion force form fields to become non-zero too, which can further enlarge
the groups. Our investigation focuses on the generalised structure and holonomy
groups in the transverse spaces K_n of (Minkowski) \times K_n backgrounds for
n=6, 7, 8 and 10, and shows how the generalised holonomies allow the continued
existence of supersymmetric backgrounds even though the usual Riemannian
special holonomy is destroyed by the inclusion of the string or M-theory

generalization of the combinatorics of irreducible characters from Lie type A

type. The main results of this paper are: (1) a combinatorial description of
the crystal graphs corresponding to the irreducible representations (this
result includes a transparent proof, based on the Yang-Baxter equation, of the
fact that the mentioned description does not depend on the choice involved in
our model); (2) a combinatorial realization of Lusztig's involution on the
canonical basis (this involution exhibits the crystals as self-dual posets,
corresponds to the action of the longest Weyl group element on an irreducible
representation, and generalizes Schutzenberger's involution on tableaux); (3)
an analog for arbitrary root systems, based on the Yang-Baxter equation, of
Schutzenberger's sliding algorithm, which is also known as jeu de taquin (this

say the eigenvalue 1 case. Of course this is a more involved situation because
the existence of the smooth stratum for the hypersurface {f = 0} forces to
consider three strata for the nearby cycles. And we already know that the
smooth stratum is always ""tangled"" if it is not alone (see [B.84b] and the
introduction of [B.03]). The new phenomenon is the role played here by a ""new""
cohomology group, denote by $H^n_{c\cap S}(F)_{=1}$, of the Milnor's fiber of f
at the origin. It has the same dimension as $H^n(F)_{=1}$ and $H^n_c(F)_{=1}$,
and it leads to a non trivial factorization of the canonical map $$ can :
H^n_{c\cap S}(F)_{=1} \to H^n_c(F)_{=1},$$ and to a monodromic isomorphism of
variation $$ var :H^n_{c\cap S}(F)_{=1}\to H^n_c(F)_{=1}.$$ It gives a
canonical hermitian form $$ \mathcal{H} : H^n_{c\cap S}(F)_{=1} \times H^n(F
)_{=1} \to \mathbb{C}$$ which is non degenerate. This generalizes the case of
an isolated singularity for the eigenvalue 1 (see [B.90] and [B.97]). The
""overtangling"" phenomenon for strata associated to the eigenvalue 1 implies the
existence of triple poles at negative integers (with big enough absolute value)
for the meromorphic continuation of the distribution $\int_X |f

proton and neutron ground-state densities that are generated from
accurately-calibrated models. Even so, these models yield a wide range of
values (from 0.13 fm to 0.28 fm) for the poorly known neutron skin thickness in

the eikonal approximation to understand the insensitivity of the differential
cross section to the various neutron densities. As the diffractive oscillations
of the cross sections are controlled by the matter radius of the nucleus, the
large spread in the neutron skin among the various models gets diluted into a

freedom in this potential to reproduce the experimental values of the

width of the excited $0_2^+$ state and the monopole $0_2^+ \to 0_1^+ $
transition matrix element in good agreement with the experimental data. In this
case, the three-body potential has strong short-range attraction supporting a
narrow resonance above the $0_2^+$ state, the excited-state wave function
contains a significant short-range component, and the excited-state

rejecting the solutions with an additional narrow resonance, one finds that the

always a minority among their neighbours to support their state. The model
introduced here captures this essential feature showing a clear transition

noise, the dynamics of the system can only take place at a precise critical
connectivity since, away from this critical point, the system remains in a
static phase. When the noise is very small, the critical connectivity becomes
very large, and highly connected networks are obtained like the airports
network and the Internet. This model may be used as a starting point for
understanding the evolution of agents living on networks.

system ready for the transition towards shared conventions, which, observed on
the time-scale of collective behaviors, becomes sharper and sharper with system
size. This surprising result not only explains why human language can scale up

transferred genes in microbial populations. The model is a generalization of
the stochastic model described by Berg and Kurland and includes five
parameters: the rate of mutational inactivation, selection coefficient,
immigration rate (i.e., rate of arrival of a novel sequence from outside of the
recipient population), within-population horizontal transmission rate, and
population size. The model of Berg and Kurland included four parameters,
namely, mutational inactivation, selection coefficient, population size, and
transmission rate. However, the effect of transmission was disregarded in the
interpretation of the results, and the overall conclusion was that horizontally
acquired sequences can be fixed in a population only when they confer a
substantial selective advantage onto the recipient and therefore are subject to
strong positive selection. By contrast, analysis of the present model in
different domains of parameter values shows that, as long as the rate of
within-population horizontal transmission is comparable to the mutational
inactivation rate and there is even a low rate of immigration, horizontally
acquired sequences can be fixed in the population or at least persist for a
long time even when they are neutral or slightly deleterious. The available
biological data strongly suggest that intense within-population and even
between-populations gene flows are realistic for at least some prokaryotic
species and environments. Therefore our modeling results are compatible with
the notion of a pivotal role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of
prokaryotes.

empty n-vertex graph. 3. The quantum walk on the Cartesian product of a
m-vertex path P and a circulant G, is average uniform mixing if G is. This
highlights a difference between circulants and the hypercubes. Our proofs
employ purely elementary arguments based on the spectra of the graphs.

Lett. 96, 020501 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.020501",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper we numerically investigate the fault-tolerant threshold for
optical cluster-state quantum computing. We allow both photon loss noise and
depolarizing noise (as a general proxy for all local noise), and obtain a
threshold region of allowed pairs of values for the two types of noise. Roughly
speaking, our results show that scalable optical quantum computing is possible
for photon loss probabilities less than 0.003, and for depolarization
probabilities less than 0.0001.

aspect of Einstein's work that is often down-played: his contribution to the
debate on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Contrary to popular opinion,
Bohr had no defence against Einstein's 1935 attack (the EPR paper) on the
claimed completeness of orthodox quantum mechanics. I suggest that Einstein's
argument, as stated most clearly in 1946, could justly be called Einstein's
reality-locality-completeness theorem, since it proves that one of these three
must be false. Einstein's instinct was that completeness of orthodox quantum
mechanics was the falsehood, but he failed in his quest to find a more complete
theory that respected reality and locality. Einstein's theorem, and possibly
Einstein's failure, inspired John Bell in 1964 to prove his reality-locality
theorem. This strengthened Einstein's theorem (but showed the futility of his
quest) by demonstrating that either reality or locality is a falsehood. This
revealed the full nonlocality of the quantum world for the first time.

a result, for such a set, we completely characterize deterministic local
copiability and show that local copying is more difficult than local
discrimination. From these result, we can conclude that lack algebraic symmetry
causes extra non-locality of a set.

than the healing length behave in the same way as quantum fields within a
universe undergoing an accelerated expansion. This analogy facilitates the
application of many tools and concepts known from general relativity (such as
horizons) and the prediction of the corresponding effects such as the freezing
of modes after horizon crossing and the associated amplification of quantum
fluctuations. Basically the same amplification mechanism is (according to our
standard model of cosmology) supposed to be responsible for the generation of
the initial inhomogeneities -- and hence the seeds for the formation of
structures such as our galaxy -- during cosmic inflation (i.e., a very early
epoch in the evolution of our universe). After a general discussion of the
analogy (\emph{analogue cosmology}), we calculate the frozen and amplified
density-density fluctuations for quasi-two dimensional (Q2D) and three
dimensional (3D) condensates which undergo a free expansion after switching off
the (longitudinal) trap. PACS: 03.75.Kk, 04.62.+v.
