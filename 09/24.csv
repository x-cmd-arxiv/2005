remained approximately constant since its formation, as predicted, then the
INITIAL CMF must have been characterized by a mean mass that was only slightly
larger than the present mean mass. From our detailed analysis of the expected
evolution of CMFs, we conclude that our observations of the M82 B CMF are
inconsistent with a scenario in which the 1 Gyr-old cluster population
originated from an initial power-law mass distribution. Our conclusion is
supported by arguments related to the initial density in M82 B, which would
have been unphysically high if the present cluster population were the remains

deposition around black hole-torus systems, the relation between the on- and
off-axis appearance of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is discussed in
terms of energetics, duration, average Lorentz factor, and probability of
observation, assuming that the central engines are remnants of binary neutron
star or neutron star-black hole mergers. As a consequence of the interaction
with the torus matter at the jet basis and the subsequent expansion of the jets
into an extremely low-density environment, the collimated ultrarelativistic
outflows possess flat core profiles with only little variation of
radially-averaged properties, and are bounded by very steep lateral edges.
Owing to the rapid decrease of the isotropic-equivalent energy near the jet
edges, the probability of observing the lateral, lower Lorentz factor wings is
significantly reduced and most short GRBs should be seen with on-axis-like
properties. Taking into account cosmological and viewing angle effects,
theoretical predictions are made for the short-GRB distributions with redshift
z, fluence, and isotropic-equivalent energy. The observational data for short
bursts with determined redshifts are found to be compatible with the
predictions only if either the intrinsic GRB rate density drops rapidly at z>1,
or a large number of events at z>1 are missed, implying that the subenergetic
GRB 050509b was an extremely rare low-fluence event with detectable photon flux
only because of its proximity and shortness. It appears unlikely that GRB
050509b can be explained as an off-axis event. The detection of short GRBs with
small Lorentz factors is statistically disfavored, suggesting a possible reason
for the absence of soft short bursts in the duration-hardness diagram.

Massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, older

the most massive systems. These findings are consistent with recent

15.0 microns and including several narrow bands that isolate the infrared
aromatic spectral features commonly referred to as PAHs. Most of the MIR
emission is dominated by PAHs and it is likely that emission from VSGs
contribute only negligibly except in the broad IRAS-equivalent band. The flux
ratios are typical of galaxies with low SFRs or quiesent regions within
galaxies (e.g M~83) and a very high PAH/continuum ratio is observed. The PAH
emission follows the CO distribution and also shows some correlation within the
disk with the lambda 850 micron distribution. However, the PAH emission also
reaches larger galactocentric radii than the CO and other correlations suggest
that the PAHs are also more widespread. A significant new discovery is the
presence of PAHs in the halo of the galaxy. In the narrow bands that isolate
single PAH features, the emission shows structure similar to high latitude
features seen in other galaxies in other tracers. The features extend as far as
6.5 kpc from the plane but scale heights of 3.5 kpc are more typical. The
(lambda 11.3/lambda7.7) ratio also appears to increase with distance from the
major axis. To our knowledge, this is the first time PAHs have been seen in the

increases the number of binaries with spatially resolved measurements at 10
micron by a factor of ~5. Combined with resolved near-infrared photometry and
spectroscopic accretion diagnostics, we find that ~10% of stars with a
mid-infrared excess do not appear to be accreting. In contrast to an actively
accreting disk system, these passive disks have significantly lower
near-infrared colors that are, in most cases, consistent with photospheric
emission, suggesting the presence of an inner disk hole. In addition, there
appears to be a spectral type/mass dependence associated with the presence of a
passive disk, with all passive disks occurring around M type stars. The
possibility that the passive disks are caused by the presence of an as yet
undetected companion at a small separation (0.3-3 AU) is possible for any
individual system, however, it cannot account for the spectral type dependence
of the passive disk sample as a whole. We propose that these passive disks
represent a subset of T Tauri stars that are undergoing significant disk
evolution. The fraction of observed passive disks and the observed spectral

disk photoevaporation from the central star. (abridged).

velocity indicates that the clouds are part of the Galactic disk, despite their
large forbidden velocity. The median angular diameter of the clouds detected in
the VGPS is 3.4 arcminutes. These clouds would not be noticed in previous low
resolution surveys because of strong beam dilution. Assuming each cloud is
located at the tangent point, a median cloud has a diameter of 10 pc, HI mass
of 60 M_sun, and a velocity more than 25 km/s beyond the local terminal
velocity derived from 12CO observations. Three clouds in the sample have a

latitude distribution of the clouds is nearly flat. The observed longitude and

scale length 2.8 - 8 kpc at the 99% confidence level. We find a lower limit to

remarkably luminous event. Spectroscopically, SN 2005bf underwent a unique
transformation from a Type Ic-like event at early times to a typical Type Ib
supernova at later phases. The initial maximum in u'g'BV was accompanied by the
presence in the spectrum of high velocity absorption lines of Fe II, Ca II, and
H I. The photospheric velocity derived from spectra at early epochs was
unusually low compared with ordinary Type Ib supernovae. We describe
one-dimensional computer simulations which attempt to account for these
remarkable properties. The most favored model is that of a very energetic (2 x
10^{51} erg), asymmetric explosion of a massive (8.3 M_sun) Wolf-Rayet WN star
that had lost most of its hydrogen envelope. We speculate that an unobserved
relativistic jet was launched producing a two-component explosion consisting of
1) a polar explosion containing a small fraction of the total mass and moving
at high velocity, and 2) the explosion of the rest of the star. At first, only
the polar explosion is observed, producing the initial maximum and the high
velocity absorption-line spectrum resembling a Type Ic event. At late times,
this fast-moving component becomes optically-thin, revealing the slower-moving
explosion of the rest of the star and transforming the observed spectrum to
that of a typical Type Ib supernova. If this scenario is correct, then SN
2005bf is the best example to date of a transition object between normal Type
Ib/Ic supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

long GRBs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminous
star-forming host galaxies. They are likely produced in core-collapse
explosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativistic
jets (collapsar model). Internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of the
relativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slow
moving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. These shocks
are believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularly
shaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinct
internal collision. The expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellar
medium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible for
producing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the X-ray, optical and
radio bands. Here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the most
distant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to a
distance of 13 billion light-years from Earth, corresponding to a time when the
Universe was just 700 million to 750 million years old. The discovery of a
gamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive stars
only 700 million years after the Big Bang. The very high redshift bursts
represent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the Universe
came out of the Dark Ages.

seen almost edge-on, and a faint large-scale (45 kpc in diameter) warped
structure, inclined by 60^o-70^o with respect to the disk major axis. The
triplet shows relatively small velocity dispersion (69 km/s) and a large
crossing time (0.17 in units of the Hubble time). The disk of AM 1934-563
demonstrates optical colors typical for an early-type spirals, strong radial
color gradient, and almost exponential surface brightness distribution with an
exponential scale-length value of 3.1 kpc (R passband). The galaxy shows a
maximum rotation velocity of about 200 km/s and it lies close to the
Tully-Fisher relation for spiral galaxies. The suspected polar ring is faint
(\mu(B) > 24) and strongly warped. Its total luminosity comprises (10-15)% of
the total luminosity of AM 1934-563. We then try to model this system using
numerical simulations, and study its possible formation mechanisms. We find
that the most robust model, that reproduces the observed characteristics of the
ring and the host galaxy, is the tidal transfer of mass from a massive gas-rich
donor galaxy to the polar ring. The physical properties of the triplet of
galaxies are in agreement with this scenario.

sources we collected mid-IR fluxes from the MSX (6C) and the ISO-SWS
catalogues. Most stars have spectral energy distributions up to 21 microns, and
some (1/3) up to 45 microns. This wide wavelength coverage allows us to obtain
reliable bolometric magnitudes. The properties of our sample are discussed with
emphasis on about 70 stars with astrometric distances. We show that mid-IR
fluxes are crucial to estimate the magnitude of stars with dusty envelopes. We
construct HR diagrams and show that the luminosities agree fairly well with
model predictions based on the Schwarzschild's criterion, contrary to what is
widely argued in the literature. A problem with the brightness of C stars does
not appear to exist. From the relative number of Mira and Semiregular
C-variables, we argue that the switch between these classes is unlikely to be
connected to thermal pulses. The relevance of the two populations varies with
the evolution, with Miras dominating the final stages. We also analyze mass
loss rates, which increase for increasing luminosity, but with a spread that
probably results from a dependence on a number of parameters (like e.g.
different stellar masses and different mechanisms powering stellar winds).
Instead, mass loss rates are well monitored by IR colours, especially if
extended to 20 microns and beyond, where AGB envelopes behave like black
bodies. From these colours the evolutionary status of various classes of C
stars is discussed.

spectrum can be derived from the density power spectrum for the constant linear
biasing of galaxy formation, which makes it possible to estimate \beta_S =
\Omega_m^{0.6} / b_S parameter precisely where \Omega_m is the matter density

h^{-1}Mpc) that spans the linear to the quasi-linear regimes. The estimated

\beta_S=0.49_{-0.05}^{+0.08} or \Omega_m = 0.30_{-0.05}^{+0.09} b_S^{5/3}, and
the amplitude of mass fluctuation as

the cosmic variance. We have also estimated the mass density power spectrum.
For example, at k=0.1047 h Mpc^{-1} (\lambda=60 h^{-1}Mpc) we measure
\Omega_m^{1.2} P_{\delta}(k)=(2.51_{-0.94}^{+0.91})\times 10^3 (h^{-1}Mpc)^3,

our earlier work using a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to map the
tunneling problem to the x-ray edge problem, which accounts for the infrared
catastrophe caused by the sudden introduction of a new electron into a
conductor during a tunneling event. Here we use a cumulant expansion to include
fluctuations about this x-ray edge limit. We find that the dominant effect of
electron-electron interaction at low energies is to correct the noninteracting
Green's function by a factor exp(-S), where S can be interpreted as the
Euclidean action for a density field describing the time-dependent charge
distribution of the newly added electron. Initially localized, this charge
distribution spreads in time as the electron is accommodated by the host
conductor, and during this relaxation process action is accumulated according
to classical electrostatics with a screened interaction. The theory applies to
lattice or continuum models of any dimensionality, with or without
translational invariance. In one dimension the method correctly predicts a
power-law density of states (DOS) for electrons with short-range interaction
and no disorder, and when applied to the solvable Tomonaga-Luttinger model, the
exact DOS is obtained.

geometry. Magnetic films are grown irreversibly by adding spins at the
boundaries of the growing interface. A competing situation with two opposite
short range surface magnetic fields of the same magnitude is analyzed. Due to
the antisymmetric condition considered, an interface between domains with spins
having opposite orientations develops along the growing direction. Such
interface undergoes a localization-delocalization transition that is identified
as a quasi-wetting transition, in qualitative agreement with observations
performed under equilibrium conditions. In addition, the film also exhibits a
growing interface that undergoes morphological transitions in the growth mode.
It is shown that, as a consequence of the nonequilibrium nature of the

and interface growth mechanisms leads to more rich and complex physical
features than in the equilibrium counterpart. Indeed, a phase diagram that

theoretical interest, the layered sine-Gordon model has been used to describe
the vortex properties of high transition temperature superconductors, and the
extension of the previous analysis to a general N-layer model is necessary for
a description of the critical behaviour of vortices in realistic multi-layer

found to be the decisive parameter with respect to the phase structure of the
N-layer models, with neighbouring layers being coupled by quadratic terms in
the field variables. By a suitable rotation of the field variables, we identify
the periodic modes (without explicit mass terms) in the N-layer structure,
calculate the effective action and determine their Kosterlitz-Thouless type
phase transitions to occur at a coupling parameter \beta^2_{c} = 8 N \pi, where
N is the number of layers (or flavours in terms of the multi-flavour Schwinger

trees from molecular data. The evolutionary model is given by a Markov chain on
a tree. Given samples from the leaves of the Markov chain, the goal is to
reconstruct the leaf-labelled tree.
  It is well known that in order to reconstruct a tree on $n$ leaves, sample
sequences of length $\Omega(\log n)$ are needed. It was conjectured by M. Steel
that for the CFN/Ising evolutionary model, if the mutation probability on all
edges of the tree is less than $p^{\ast} = (\sqrt{2}-1)/2^{3/2}$, then the tree
can be recovered from sequences of length $O(\log n)$. The value $p^{\ast}$ is
given by the transition point for the extremality of the free Gibbs measure for
the Ising model on the binary tree. Steel's conjecture was proven by the second
author in the special case where the tree is ""balanced."" The second author also
proved that if all edges have mutation probability larger than $p^{\ast}$ then
the length needed is $n^{\Omega(1)}$. Here we show that Steel's conjecture
holds true for general trees by giving a reconstruction algorithm that recovers
the tree from $O(\log n)$-length sequences when the mutation probabilities are
discretized and less than $p^\ast$. Our proof and results demonstrate that
extremality of the free Gibbs measure on the infinite binary tree, which has
been studied before in probability, statistical physics and computer science,
determines how distinguishable are Gibbs measures on finite binary trees.

On a finite connected graph, it is easy to see that the system learns to
cooperate by converging to the all-cooperate state in a finite time. We analyze
the rate of convergence in terms of the size and structure of the graph. [Dyer
et al., 2002] showed that the system converges rapidly on the cycle, but that
it takes a time exponential in the size of the graph to converge to cooperation
on the complete graph. We show that the emergence of cooperation is
exponentially slow in some expander graphs. More surprisingly, we show that it
is also exponentially slow in bounded-degree trees, where many other dynamics
are known to converge rapidly.

by the reaction 71Ga(\nu_e,e^-)71Ge. Extractions were made from a portion of
the gallium target in the Russian-American Gallium Experiment SAGE and the
extraction samples were transported to the Gran Sasso laboratory for synthesis
and counting at the Gallium Neutrino Observatory GNO. Six extractions of this
type were made and the resultant solar neutrino capture rate was 64
^{+24}_{-22} SNU, which agrees well with the overall result of the gallium
experiments. The major purpose of this experiment was to make it possible for
SAGE to continue their regular schedule of monthly solar neutrino extractions
without interruption while a separate experiment was underway to measure the
response of 71Ga to neutrinos from an 37Ar source. As side benefits, this
experiment proved the feasibility of long-distance sample transport in ultralow
background radiochemical experiments and familiarized each group with the
methods and techniques of the other.

neutrino oscillation measurement which cannot be reconciled within a
three-neutrino theory. We examine this inconsistency for a single region of
baseline to neutrino energy $L/E$. Assuming that sterile neutrinos account for
the anomaly, we find that the {\it local} demands of this datum can require the
addition to the theory of one to three sterile neutrinos. We examine the
constraints which can be used to determine when more than one neutrino would be
required. The results apply only to a given region of $L/E$. The question of
the adequacy of the sterile neutrinos to satisfy a global analysis is not
addressed here. Finally, using the results of a 3+2 analysis, we indicate
values for unknown mixing matrix elements which would require two sterile
neutrinos due to local demands only.

taking into account the relativistic effects in the theory of the hydrogen
atom. Ever since, it has puzzled many scientists like Eddington, Dirac, Feynman
and others. Here the mysterious fine-structure constant, alpha = (Compton
wavelength/de Broglie wavelength) = 1/137.036 = 2.627/360 is interpreted based
on the finding that it is close to 2.618/360 = 1/137.508, where the Compton
wavelength for hydrogen is a distance equivalent to an arc length on the
circumference (given by the de Broglie wavelength) of a circle with the Bohr
radius and 2.618 is the square of the Golden ratio, which was recently shown to
divide the Bohr radius into two Golden sections at the point of electrical
neutrality. From the data for the electron (e) and proton (p) g-factors, it is
found that (137.508 - 137.036)= 0.472 = [g(p) - g(e)]/[g(p) + g(e)] (= 2/cube
of the Golden ratio), and that (2.627 - 2.618)/360 = (small part of the Compton
wavelength corresponding to the intrinsic radii of e and p/de Broglie
wavelength) = 0.009/360 = (1- gamma)/gamma, the factor for the advance of
perihilion in Sommerfeld's theory of the hydrogen atom, where gamma is the
relativity factor.

slower. A possible explanation for this observation is selection for proteins
which fold properly despite mistranslation, in short selection for
translational robustness. Translational robustness leads to the somewhat
paradoxical prediction that highly expressed genes are extremely tolerant to
missense substitutions but nevertheless evolve very slowly. Here, we study a
simple theoretical model of translational robustness that allows us to gain
analytic insight into how this paradoxical behavior arises.
