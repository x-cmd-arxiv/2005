is one of the most exciting discoveries of observational gamma-ray astronomy in
the very high energy regime. This result clearly demonstrates that X-ray
binaries with relativistic jets (microquasars) are sites of effective
acceleration of particles (electrons and/or protons) to multi-TeV energies.
Whether the gamma-rays are of hadronic or leptonic origin is a key issue
related to the origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays. We discuss different possible
scenarios for the production of gamma-rays, and argue in favor of hadronic
origin of TeV photons, especially if they are produced within the binary
system. If so, the detected gamma-rays should be accompanied by a flux of high
energy neutrinos emerging from the decays of \pi^\pm mesons produced at pp
and/or p \gamma interactions. The flux of TeV neutrinos, which can be estimated
on the basis of the detected TeV gamma-ray flux, taking into account the
internal \gamma \gamma \to e^+e^- absorption, depends significantly on the
location of gamma-ray production region(s). The minimum neutrino flux above 1
TeV is expected to be at the level of 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}; however, it
could be up to a factor of 100 larger. The detectability of the signal of
multi-TeV neutrinos significantly depends on the high energy cutoff in the
spectrum of parent protons; if the spectrum of accelerated protons continues to
1 PeV and beyond, the predicted neutrino fluxes can be probed by the planned
km^3-scale neutrino detector.

the Galactic dust composition. The echo also appears to be more consistent with
a SN distance closer to 7 Mpc than 9 Mpc. This further supports the conclusion
we reached elsewhere that the initial mass for the SN progenitor was relatively
low (about 8--9 M_suns). HST should be used to continue to monitor the echo in
several bands, particularly in the blue, to better constrain its origin.

Initial Mass Function (IMF) for masses M <~ 1 M_solar. The low-mass
main-sequence mass function of the LMC field is found not to have a uniform
slope throughout the observed mass range, i.e. the slope does not follow a
single power law. This slope changes at about 1 M_solar to become more shallow
for stars with smaller masses down to the lowest observed mass of ~ 0.7
M_solar, giving clear indications of flattening for even smaller masses. We
verified statistically that for stars with M <~ 1 M_solar the IMF has a slope
Gamma around -2, with an indicative slope Gamma =~ -1.4 for 0.7 <~ M/M_solar <~
0.9, while for more massive stars the main-sequence mass function becomes much
steeper with Gamma =~ -5. The main-sequence luminosity function (LF) of the
observed field is in very good agreement with the Galactic LF as it was
previously found. Taking into account several assumptions concerning
evolutionary effects, which should have changed through time the stellar
content of the observed field, we reconstruct qualitatively its IMF for the
whole observed mass range (0.7 <~ M/M_solar <~ 2.3) and we find that the number
of observed evolved stars is not large enough to have affected significantly
the form of the IMF, which thus is found almost identical to the observed PDMF.

Mouhcine & Lancon (2003) models, that the star clusters and the latest star

same time, there is a slight offset between the galaxies and the star clusters
[the latter are ~ 0.7 mag fainter than the former at a given value of (V - I)],
caused by the difference in metallicity of roughly a factor of two. The

1758-258 displayed another of its peculiar dim soft states like the one
observed in 2001, increasing the number of observed occurrences of this state
to three. During the other epochs the source was in the hard state. The hard
X-ray emission component in the epoch-summed spectra can be well described
either by phenomenological models, namely a cutoff power law in the hard state
and a pure power law in the dim soft state, or by thermal Comptonization
models. A soft thermal component is clearly present in the dim soft state and
might also contribute to the softer hard state spectra. We argue that in the
recently emerging picture of the hardness-intensity evolution of black hole
transient outbursts in which hard and soft states are observed to occur in a
large overlapping range of luminosities (hysteresis), the dim soft state is not
peculiar. As noted before for the 2001 dim soft state, these episodes seem to
be triggered by a sudden decrease (within days) of the hard emission, with the
soft spectral component decaying on a longer time scale (weeks). We discuss

strength of HI 1216A cooling emission depends strongly on the treatment of the
self-shielded phase of the IGM in the simulations, our predictions for the HeII
1640A line are more robust because the HeII 1640A emissivity is negligible
below T~10^4.5 K and less sensitive to the UV background. Although HeII 1640A
cooling emission is fainter than HI 1216A by at least a factor of 10 and,
unlike HI 1216A, might not be resolved spatially with current observational
facilities, it is more suitable to study gas accretion in the galaxy formation
process because it is optically thin and less contaminated by the recombination
lines from star-forming galaxies. The HeII 1640A line can be used to
distinguish among mechanisms for powering the so-called ""Lyman alpha blobs"" --
including gravitational cooling radiation, photoionization by stellar
populations, and starburst-driven superwinds -- because (1) HeII 1640A emission
is limited to very low metallicity (log(Z/Z_sun) < -5.3) and Population III
stars, and (2) the blob's kinematics are probed unambiguously through the HeII
1640A line width, which, for cooling radiation, is narrower (sigma < 400 km/s)
than typical wind speeds.

species or a MRN grain size distribution. The grain size distribution is
calculated using Gauss-Legendre weights and the integrals over the continuous

grain population can then be thought of as a series of separate grain size
classes, each with uniquely specified properties. The dynamics of each grain
size class is different through the shock front, with the smaller grain classes
remaining coupled to the magnetic field and larger grains becoming partially
decoupled from the magnetic field due to collisions with the neutrals. The
importance of grain charging is also demonstrated. The effects of the
orientation of the pre-shock magnetic field B_0 are also considered. It is
found that there are critical orientations for B_0 in which the shock is no
longer C-type and the transition becomes C$^*$ or J-type. The degree of
non-coplanarity of the shock solution depends upon the grain model chosen, as
well as the orientation of B_0.

the other hand still lacking because of the demanding sensitivity (fraction of
microCrab in the 20-40 keV for 1 Ms integration time) and imaging (~15"" angular
resolution) requirements. The mission ideas currently being proposed are based
on long focal length, grazing incidence, multi-layer optics, coupled with focal
plane detectors with few hundreds microns spatial resolution capability. The
required large focal lengths, ranging between 8 and 50 m, can be realized by
means of extendable optical benches (as foreseen e.g. for the HEXIT-SAT, NEXT

While the final telescope design will require a detailed trade-off analysis
between all the relevant parameters (focal length, plate scale value, angular
resolution, field of view, detector size, and sensitivity degradation due to
detector dead area and telescope vignetting), extreme attention must be
dedicated to the background minimization. In this respect, key issues are
represented by the passive baffling system, which in case of large focal
lengths requires particular design assessments, and by the active/passive
shielding geometries and materials. In this work, the result of a study of the
expected background for a hard X-ray telescope is presented, and its
implication on the required sensitivity, together with the possible
implementation design concepts for active and passive shielding in the

also evaluate SBF amplitudes by using Monte Carlo techniques to reproduce the
random variation in the number of stars experiencing bright and fast
evolutionary phases (Red Giant Branch, AGB, TP-AGB). We provide constraints
upon the faintest integrated flux of real stellar populations required to
derive reliable and meaningful SBF measurements. We analyze a technique for
deriving SBF amplitudes of star clusters from the photometry of individual
stars, and estimate the indetermination due to statistical effects, which may
impinge on the procedure. The first optical SBF measurements for 11 Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) star rich clusters - with age ranging from few $Myr$ to
several $Gyr$ - are derived by using Hubble Space Telescope observations. The
measurements are successfully compared to our SBF predictions, thus providing a
good agreement with models of metallicity $Z = 0.0001$-0.01. A mass loss as a
power-law function of the TP-AGB star luminosity is required in order to
properly reproduce the optical SBF data of the LMC clusters. We suggest how to
overcome the general problem of SBF models in reproducing the details of the
near-infrared SBF measurements of the Magellanic Cloud star clusters.

galaxy clusters performed using the Tree+SPH code GADGET-2. We investigate the
dependence of the baryon fraction upon the radiative cooling, star formation,
feedback through galactic winds, conduction and redshift. Both the cold stellar
component and the hot X-ray emitting gas have narrow distributions that, at
large cluster-centric distances r>R500, are nearly independent of the physics
included in the simulations. Only the non-radiative runs reproduce the gas
fraction inferred from observations of the inner regions (r ~ R2500) of massive
clusters. When cooling is turned on, the excess star formation is mitigated by
the action of galactic winds, but yet not by the amount required by
observational data. The baryon fraction within a fixed overdensity increases
slightly with redshift, independent of the physical processes involved in the
accumulation of baryons in the cluster potential well. In runs with cooling and
feedback, the increase in baryons is associated with a larger stellar mass
fraction that arises at high redshift as a consequence of more efficient gas
cooling. For the same reason, the gas fraction appears less concentrated at
higher redshift. We discuss the possible cosmological implications of our
results and find that two assumptions generally adopted, (1) mean value of Yb =
fb / (Omega_b/Omega_m) not evolving with redshift, and (2) a fixed ratio
between f_star and f_gas independent of radius and redshift, might not be
valid. In the estimate of the cosmic matter density parameter, this implies
some systematic effects of the order of Delta Omega_m/Omega_m < +0.15 for
non-radiative runs and Delta Omega_m/Omega_m ~ +0.05 and < -0.05 for radiative

to the conventional theory. Here I review a multi-polaron approach to the
problem based on our extension of the BCS theory to the strong-coupling regime.
Since there is almost no retardation (i.e. no Tolmachev-Morel-Anderson
logarithm) reducing the Coulomb repulsion, e-ph interactions should be
relatively strong to overcome the direct Coulomb repulsion, so carriers must be
polaronic to form pairs in novel superconductors. I identify the Froehlich
electron-phonon interaction as the most essential for pairing in
superconducting cuprates, and discuss the ""Froehlich-Coulomb"" model of HTS,
low-energy structures, and the phase diagram of cuprates. ""Individual"" versus
Cooper pairing, normal state properties, in particular in-plane resistivity,
the Hall effect, magnetic susceptibility, the Lorenz number, the Nernst effect,
diamagnetism, spin and charge pseudogaps, and c-axis transport are also
discussed. I present a parameter-free evaluation of Tc, an explanation of
isotope effects, specific heat anomalies, upper critical fields, symmetries and
space modulations of the order parameter. Finally I introduce a model of
overdoped cuprates as mixtures of mobile bipolarons and degenerate lattice
polarons.

objects, for example the adsorption of charged ions or charged polymers (such
as DNA) on oppositely charged substrates of different geometry. The second
class comprises effective interactions between similarly charged objects. Here
the main theme is to understand the experimental finding that similarly and
highly charged bodies attract each other in the presence of multi-valent
counterions. This is demonstrated using field-theoretic arguments as well as
Monte-Carlo simulations for the case of two homogeneously charged bodies.
Realistic surfaces, on the other hand, are corrugated and also exhibit
modulated charge distributions, which is important for static properties such
as the counterion-density distribution, but has even more pronounced
consequences for dynamic properties such as the counterion mobility. More
pronounced dynamic effects are obtained with highly condensed charged systems
in strong electric fields. Likewise, an electrostatically collapsed highly
charged polymer is unfolded and oriented in strong electric fields. At the end
of this review, we give a very brief account of the behavior of water at planar
surfaces and demonstrate using ab-initio methods that specific interactions
between oppositely charged groups cause ion-specific effects that have recently

impurity by using a computational technique based on the functional
renormalization group. This extends previous work for spinless fermions to
spin-1/2 fermions. The underlying approximations are devised for weak
interactions and arbitrary impurity strengths, and have been checked by
comparing with density-matrix renormalization-group data. We present results
for the density of states, the density profile and the linear conductance.
Two-particle backscattering leads to striking effects, which are not captured
if the bulk system is approximated by its low-energy fixed point, the Luttinger
model. In particular, the expected decrease of spectral weight near the
impurity and of the conductance at low energy scales is often preceded by a
pronounced increase, and the asymptotic power laws are modified by logarithmic
corrections.

the defects. However, the measured information is indirect and when using it in

indispensable. In this article we present a computational scheme for
calculating momentum distributions of electron-positron pairs annihilating in

described using the all-electron projector augmented-wave method, and atomic
orbitals are used to describe the core states. We apply our numerical scheme to
selected systems and compare three different enhancement (electron-positron
correlation) schemes previously used in the calculation of momentum
distributions of annihilating electron-positron pairs within the
density-functional theory. We show that the use of a state-dependent
enhancement scheme leads to better results than a position-dependent
enhancement factor in the case of ratios of Doppler spectra between different
systems. Further, we demonstrate the applicability of our scheme for studying
vacancy-type defects in metals and semiconductors. Especially we study the
effect of forces due to a positron localized at a vacancy-type defect on the
ionic relaxations.

averages of convenient functions of the phase-space. The approach is applicable
for any finite number of particles $N$. The second method uses large deviation
techniques and allows us to derive explicit expressions for microcanonical
entropy and for macroscopic observables in the $N \to\infty$ limit. Assuming
ergodicity, we evaluate time averages in molecular dynamics simulations and,
using Rugh's approach, we determine the value of macroscopic observables at
finite $N$. These averages are affected by a slow time evolution, often
observed in systems with long-range interactions. We then show how the finite
$N$ time averages of macroscopic observables converge to their corresponding
$N\to\infty$ values as $N$ is increased. As expected, finite size effects scale
as $N^{-1}$.

undergo polymorphic transformations in which the helical pitch and radius
change abruptly. These transformations arise in response to mechanical loading,
changes in solution temperature and ionic strength, and point substitutions in
the amino acid sequence of the protein subunits that make up the filament. To
explain polymorphism, we propose a new coarse-grained continuum rod theory
based on the quaternary structure of the filament. The model has two molecular
switches. The first is a double-well potential for the extension of a
protofilament, which is one of the eleven almost longitudinal columns of
subunits. Curved filament shapes occur in the model when there is a mismatch
strain, i.e. when inter-subunit bonds in the inner core of the filament prefer
a subunit spacing which is intermediate between the two spacings favored by the
double-well potential. The second switch is a double-well potential for twist,
due to lateral interactions between neighboring protofilaments. Cooperative
interactions between neighboring subunits within a protofilament are necessary
to ensure the uniqueness of helical ground states. We calculate a phase diagram
for filament shapes and the response of a filament to external moment and
force.

and ends up in the singularity within finite eigentime. In the `more realistic'
case of a `classical' evaporating black hole, an observer falling onto a black
hole observes a sudden evaporation of the hole. This illustrates the fact that
the discussion of the classical process commonly found in the literature may
become obsolete when the black hole has a finite lifetime. The situation is
basically the same for more complex cases, e.g. where a particle collides with
two merging black holes. It should be pointed out that the model used in this
paper is mainly of academic interest, since the description of the physics near
a black hole horizon still presents a difficult problem which is not yet fully
understood, but our model provides a valuable possibility for students to enter
the interesting field of black hole physics and to perform numerical
calculations of their own which are not very involved from the computational

means of exotic commutator method. The hypothesis of vanishing of the exotic
commutators leads to the system of master equations (ME). Solvability
conditions of these equations define relations between the complex masses of
the nonet and decuplet mesons which, in turn, determine relations between the
real masses (mass formulae), as well as between the masses and widths of the
mesons. Mass formulae are independent of the particle widths. The masses of the
nonet and decuplet particles obey simple ordering rules. The nonet mixing angle
and the mixing matrix of the isoscalar states of the decuplet are completely
determined by solution of ME; they are real and do not depend on the widths.
All known scalar mesons with the mass smaller than $2000MeV$ (excluding
$\sigma(600)$) and one with the mass $2200\div2400MeV$ belong to two
multiplets: the nonet $(a_0(980), K_0(1430), f_0(980), f_0(1710))$ and the
decuplet $(a_0(1450), K_0(1950), f_0(1370), f_0(1500), f_0(2200)/f_0(2330))$.
It is shown that the famed anomalies of the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ widths
arise from an extra ""kinematical"" mechanism, suppressing decay, which is not
conditioned by the flavor coupling constant. Therefore, they do not justify
rejecting the $q\bar{q}$ structure of them. A unitary singlet state (glueball)
is included into the higher lying multiplet (decuplet) and is divided among the
$f_0(1370)$ and $f_0(1500)$ mesons. The glueball contents of these particles
are totally determined by the masses of decuplet particles. Mass ordering rules
indicate that the meson $\sigma(600)$ does not mix with the nonet particles.

leading order in the high-energy limit were derived for the bosonic open string
theory. The derivation was based on Ward identities derived from the decoupling
of zero-norm states and was purely algebraic. The only assumption of the
derivation was that the momentum polarization can be approximated by the
longitudinal polarization at high energies. In this paper, using the decoupling
of spurious states, we reduce this assumption to a much weaker one which can be
easily verified by simple power counting in most cases. For the special cases
which are less obvious, we verify the new assumption for an example by
saddle-point approximation. We also provide a new perspective to our previous
results in terms of DDF states. In particular, we show that, by using DDF
states, one can easily see that there is only one independent high energy
scattering amplitude for each fixed mass level.

itself: it will acquire structure in the form of ""curvature"". What we still

reconsider Hawking's theorem and show that the integrated Ricci scalar
curvature with respect to the induced metric on the event horizon is positive
also in higher dimensions. Using this and Thurston's geometric types
classification of three-manifolds, we find that the only possible geometric
types of event horizons in five dimensions are $S^3$ and $S^2 \times S^1$. In
six dimensions we use the requirement that the horizon is cobordant to a
four-sphere (topological censorship), Friedman's classification of topological
four-manifolds and Donaldson's results on smooth four-manifolds, and show that
simply connected event horizons are homeomorphic to $S^4$ or $S^2\times S^2$.
We find allowed non-simply connected event horizons $S^3\times S^1$ and
$S^2\times \Sigma_g$, and event horizons with finite non-abelian first homotopy
group, whose universal cover is $S^4$. Finally, following Smale's results we
discuss the classification in dimensions higher than six.

establishing a simpler result: the rate of convergence in the central limit
theorem for regular multidimensional functions. In this context, we prove a
result of convergence in distribution with rate of convergence in
O(n^{-1/2+\alpha}) for all \alpha>0 (for the Prokhorov metric). This result can
be seen as an extension of the main result of P\`ene [Comm. Math. Phys. 225
(2002) 91-119] to the case of d-dimensional functions. In a second time, we use
the same method to establish a result of convergence in distribution for
(\frac{e_t^{\epsilon}(x,\cdot)}{\sqrt\epsilon})_{\epsilon>0} with rate of
convergence in O(\epsilon^{1/2-\alpha}) (for the Prokhorov metric).

In this article I demonstrate that he is also the father of Solid State
Physics, or even his broader version known as Condensed Matter Physics
(including liquids). His 1907 article on the specific heat of solids
introduces, for the first time, the effect of lattice vibrations on the
thermodynamic properties of crystals, in particular the specific heat. His 1905
article on the photoelectric effect and photoluminescence opened the fields of
photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Other important
achievements include Bose-Einstein condensation and the Einstein relation
between the difussion coefficient an mobility. In this article I discuss
Einstein's papers relevant to these topics and their relevance to modern day
condensed matter physics.

H2 and Ar/H2 mixtures in a large 'GEC' cell (36 cm length_ 14 cm ID) was mapped
as a function of position, H2/Ar ratio, time, power, and pressure. Several
observations regarding the selective line broadening were particularly notable
as they are unanticipated on the basis of earlier models. First, the anomalous
broadening of the Balmer lines was found to exist throughout the plasma, and
not just in the region between the electrodes. Second, the broadening was
consistently a complex function of the operating parameters particularly gas
composition (highest in pure H2), position, power, time and pressure. Clearly
not anticipated by earlier models were the findings that under some conditions
the highest concentration of 'hot' (>10 eV) hydrogen was found at the entry
end, and not in the high field region between the electrodes and that in other
conditions, the hottest H was at the (exit) pump (also grounded electrode) end.
Third, excitation and electron temperatures were less than one eV in all
regions of the plasma not directly adjacent (>1mm) to the electrodes, providing
additional evidence that the energy for broadening, contrary to standard
models, is not obtained from the field. Fourth, in contrast to our earlier
studies of hydrogen/helium and water plasmas, we found that in some conditions
98% of the atomic hydrogen was in the 'hot' state throughout the GEC-type cell.
Virtually every operating parameter studied impacted the character of the hot H
atom population, and clearly second and third order effects exist, indicating a
need for experimental design. Some non-field mechanisms for generating hot
hydrogen atoms, specifically those suggested by Mills' CQM model, are outlined.

likelihood fitting is performed. With unbinned data, currently, the fitted

remains, to date, an unsolved problem in statistics. By considering the
transformation properties of likelihood functions with respect to change of

of variable and provides the goodness of fit. We show how to apply this
likelihood ratio for binned as well as unbinned likelihoods and show that even
the $\chi^2$ test is a special case of this general theory. In order to
calculate errors in the fitted quantities, we need to solve the problem of

scale-free topology where the probability of observing a node with a certain
number of edges (k) follows a power law: i.e. p(k) ~ k^-g. This observation has
been reproduced by evolutionary models. Here we consider the network of
protein-protein interactions and demonstrate that two published independent
measurements of these interactions produce graphs that are only weakly
correlated with one another despite their strikingly similar topology. We then
propose a physical model based on the fundamental principle that (de)solvation
is a major physical factor in protein-protein interactions. This model
reproduces not only the scale-free nature of such graphs but also a number of
higher-order correlations in these networks. A key support of the model is
provided by the discovery of a significant correlation between number of
interactions made by a protein and the fraction of hydrophobic residues on its
surface. The model presented in this paper represents the first physical model
for experimentally determined protein-protein interactions that comprehensively
reproduces the topological features of interaction networks. These results have
profound implications for understanding not only protein-protein interactions
