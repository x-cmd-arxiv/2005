includes AGN into the GalICS hybrid (N-body + semi-analytic) model to explore
the quasar-galaxy link in a cosmological perspective. The key problems are the
quasar fuelling mechanism, the origin of the BH to bulge mass relation, the
causal and chronological link between BH growth and galaxy formation, the
properties of quasar hosts and the role of AGN feedback in galaxy formation.
This first paper has two goals: to describe the general structure and the
assumptions of the method, and to apply AGNICS to studying the joint formation
of BHs and spheroids in galaxy mergers. We investigate under what conditions
this scenario can reproduce the local BH distribution and the evolution of the
quasar population. AGNICS contains two star formation modes: a quiescent one in
discs and a starburst one in protospheroids, the latter triggered by mergers
and disc instabilities. We assume that BH growth is linked to the starburst
mode. The simplest version of this scenario, in which the BH accretion rate and
the star formation rate in the starburst component are simply related by a
constant of proportionality, does not to reproduce the cosmic evolution of the
quasar population. A model in which this relation is modulated by a scaling
with the square root of the starburst gas density can explain the evolution of
the quasar luminosity function in B-band and X-rays (accounting for the
obscuration inferred from X-ray studies). The scatter and the tilt that this
model introduces in the BH-to-bulge mass relation are within the observational
constraints. The quasar contribution grows with bolometric luminosity and for a
given bulge mass the most massive BHs are in the bulges with the oldest stars.

in the diffuse warm neutral medium (WNM). Initially, a shocked layer forms, and
within it, a thin cold layer. An analytical model and high-resolution 1D
simulations predict the thermodynamic conditions in the cold layer. After $\sim
1$ Myr of evolution, the layer has column density $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{19}
\psc$, thickness $\sim 0.03$ pc, temperature $\sim 25$ K and pressure $\sim
6650$ K $\pcc$. These conditions are strongly reminiscent of those recently
reported by Heiles and coworkers for cold neutral medium sheets. In the 1D
simulations, the inflows into the sheets produce line profiles with a central
line of width $\sim 0.5 \kms$ and broad wings of width $\sim 1 \kms$. 3D
numerical simulations show that the cold layer develops turbulent motions and
increases its thickness, until it becomes a fully three-dimensional turbulent
cloud. Fully developed turbulence arises on times ranging from $\sim 7.5$ Myr
for inflow Mach number $\Mr = 2.4$ to $> 80$ Myr for $\Mr = 1.03$. These
numbers should be considered upper limits. The highest-density turbulent gas
(HDG, $n > 100 \pcc$) is always overpressured with respect to the mean WNM
pressure by factors 1.5--4, even though we do not include self-gravity. The
intermediate-density gas (IDG, $10 < n [{\rm cm}^ {-3}] < 100$) has a
significant pressure scatter that increases with $\Mr$, so that at $\Mr = 2.4$,
a significant fraction of the IDG is at a higher pressure than the HDG. Our
results suggest that the turbulence and at least part of the excess pressure in
molecular clouds can be generated by the compressive process that forms the
clouds themselves, and that thin CNM sheets may be formed transiently by this
mechanism, when the compressions are only weakly supersonic.

dwarf (BD) companions to very young BDs and (very) low-mass stars (VLMSs) in
ChaI. High-resolution echelle spectra of ChaHa1-8 and 12 (M6-M8), and B34,
CHXR74, Sz23 (M2.5-M5) were taken with UVES / VLT between 2000 and 2004. The
achieved precision (40 to 670 m/s) is sufficient to detect Jupiter mass planets
around the targets. This first RV survey of very young BDs probes multiplicity
which is a key parameter for formation in an as yet unexplored domain, in terms
of age, mass, and orbital separation. We find that the subsample of ten BDs and
VLMSs (M<0.12 Msun, M5-M8) has constant RVs on time scales of <40 days. For
them, estimates of upper limits for masses of hypothetical companions are 0.1
to 1.5 MJup (assuming 0.1 AU). This hints at a rather small multiplicity
fraction for very young BDs/VLMSs at <0.1 AU. Furthermore, the non-variable
objects demonstrate the lack of any significant RV noise due to stellar
activity down to the precision necessary to detect giant planets. Thus, very
young BDs and VLMSs are suitable targets for RV surveys for planets. Three
objects of the sample exhibit significant RV variations. For Sz23, they might
be attributed to surface activity, while for ChaHa8 (M6.5) and CHXR74 (M4.5),
the detected RV variations are on times scales of >150 days, which cannot be
explained by rotational modulation. An alternative explanation are giant
planets / BDs of at least a few Jupiter masses orbiting with periods of several
months or longer. Thus, the presented RV data indicate that orbital periods of
companions to very young BDs and (V)LMSs are possibly several months or longer,
and that orbital separations are > 0.2 AU. This parameter range has not been
covered for all targets yet, but will be probed by follow-up observations.

possible explanations of the differences observed in the radio properties of
nearby and distant clusters of galaxies. The main result of this study is that
the RLF of the distant X-ray clusters is very different from that of the local

may be populated by galaxies predominantly formed by monolithic collapse. At
high sigma, galaxies showing flatter gradients could represent objects which
suffered either important merging episodes or later gas accretion. These
processes contribute to the flattening of the metallicity gradients and their
increasing importance could define the distribution of the objects above the

marked contrast with previous works which found a correlation between
dMg2/dlogr/re* and sigma confined to the low mass galaxies, suggesting that
only galaxies below some limiting sigma were formed by collapse whereas the
massive ones by mergers. We show observational evidence that a hybrid scenario

modeling of cosmic ray electron (CR$e^{-}$) diffusion using an image-smearing

<=180 eV (<=120 eV), and on the Compton-reflection component parameter, R<=0.2,
suggest that most of the X-rays from the source are directly observed rather
than being scattered or reflected; this is also supported by the relatively
flat intrinsic alpha_ox we measure. The possibility that most of the X-ray flux
is scattered due to the high level of UV-optical polarization is ruled out.
Considering data for 46 BALQSOs from the literature, including CSO 755, we have
found that the UV-optical continuum polarization level of BALQSOs is not
correlated with any of their X-ray properties. A lack of significant short- and
long-term X-ray flux variations in the source may be attributed to a large
black-hole mass in CSO 755. We note that another luminous BALQSO, PG 2112+059,
has both similar shallow C IV BALs and moderate X-ray absorption.

investigate the correlation between various galaxy properties and halo mass. We
split the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediate
types, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed
luminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. Most
importantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire mass
range probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. We argue that the
previous claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an
artefact of the environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity
dependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends more
strongly on halo mass than on luminosity. We also find that the early type
fraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. Contrary to previous
studies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low mass
haloes. The properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with those
of their central galaxy. In particular, the early type fraction of satellites
is significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in a
halo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. This phenomenon,
which we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for
satellites of all luminosities. Finally, the fraction of intermediate type
galaxies is always ~20 percent, independent of luminosity, independent of halo
mass, independent of halo-centric radius, and independent of whether the galaxy
is a central galaxy or a satellite galaxy. We discuss the implications of all
these findings for galaxy formation and evolution.

the observed characteristics of voids may point to a problem in galaxy
formation models, but testing these claims has been difficult without any clear
predictions for their properties. In order to address such questions, we build
a model to describe the distribution of galaxy underdensities. Our model is
based on the ""excursion set formalism,"" the same technique used to predict the
dark matter halo mass function. We find that, because of bias, galaxy voids are
typically significantly larger than dark matter voids and should fill most of
the universe. We show that voids selected from catalogs of luminous galaxies
should be larger than those selected from faint galaxies: the characteristic
radii range from ~5-10h^{-1} Mpc for galaxies with absolute r-band magnitudes
M_r-5 log(h) < -16 to -20. These are reasonably close to, though somewhat
smaller than, the observed sizes. The discrepancy may result from the void
selection algorithm or from their internal structure. We also compute the halo
populations inside voids. We expect small haloes (M<10^{11} Msun) to be up to a
factor of two less underdense than the haloes of normal galaxies. Within large
voids, the mass function is nearly independent of the size of the underdensity,
but finite-size effects play a significant role in small voids (R<7h^{-1} Mpc).

spheroids form stars relatively inefficiently as a consequence of
supernova-triggered negative feedback via a sequence of ministarbursts (S
mode), whereas massive spheroids formed rapidly with high efficiency via the
impact of AGN jet-triggered positive feedback (J mode) that generates and
enhances ultraluminous starbursts. Supermassive black hole growth by accretion
is favoured in the gas-rich protospheroid environment as mergers build up the
mass of the host galaxy and provide a centrally concentrated gas supply.
Quasi-spherical outflows arise and provide the source of porosity as the
energetic jets from the accreting central SMBH are isotropised by the
inhomogeneous interstellar medium in the protospheroid core. Super-Eddington
outflows occur and help generate both the SMBH at high redshift and the strong
positive feedback on protospheroid star formation that occurs as dense
interstellar clouds are overpressured and collapse. SMBH form before the bulk
of spheroid stars, and the correlation between spheroid velocity dispersion and
supermassive black hole mass arises as AGN-triggered outflows limit the gas
reservoir for spheroid star formation. The super-Eddington phase plausibly
triggers a top-heavy IMF in the region of influence of the SMBH. The
Compton-cooled Eddington-limited outflow phase results in a spheroid core whose
phase space density scales as the inverse 5/2 power of the core mass, and whose
mass scales as the 3/2 power of SMBH mass. This latter scaling suggests that
SMBH growth (and hence spheroid formation) is anti-hierarchical.

in the Local Group, the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and compare their properties

simple building block scenario and with effects expected from reionization. We
show that the star formation histories of dSphs are inconsistent with the
predicted cessation of star formation after reionization; instead, extended
star formation episodes are observed. The Galactic dSphs contain in part
prominent intermediate-age populations, whereas the Galactic halo does not.
Conversely, the M31 dSphs are almost entirely old, while the M31 halo contains
a substantial intermediate-age population. These differences in the population
structure as well as the differences in the modes of star formation inferred
from [alpha/Fe] ratios make dSphs unlikely major contributors to the build-up
of the Galactic and M31 halo unless most of the accretion occurred at early
epochs. On the other hand, there is clear evidence for ongoing harassment and
accretion of a number of dSphs.

the IGM, then VMSs associated with pair-instability supernovae (PI-SNe) in
low-mass halos at high redshift must produce at least 50% of the Si. The
remainder is from later galactic outflows of SN II debris, which also provide
most of the C and O. Both sources are required to account for the metal
inventory in the IGM. The early VMS production must continue until redshift
z~15 so that the efficiency of VMS formation per low-mass halo is significantly
below unity. Contributions from the later galactic outflows mainly occur at
z~4-6. Using a Salpeter initial mass function, we infer that the number of VMSs
producing massive black holes (MBHs) is 0.72 times the the number of VMSs
associated with PI-SNe. The amount of metals (particularly Si) in the IGM that
is attributable to PI-SNe is thus closely coupled with the total mass of MBHs
produced in epochs prior to galaxy formation. Production of ~50% of the Si in
the IGM by PI-SNe corresponds to an early inventory of MBHs that is comparable
to the global mass budget of the central supermassive black holes in
present-day galaxies. (Abridged)

(LMXBs) associated with NGC 4649. We find evidence for variability in three
sources between this observation and a previous Chandra observation.
Additionally, we detect five sources that were not detected with Chandra
despite its better detection limit, suggesting that these sources have since
brightened. The total X-ray spectrum of the resolved sources is well-fit by a
hard power-law, while the diffuse spectrum requires a hard and a soft
component, presumably due to the relatively soft diffuse gas and the harder
unresolved sources. A deprojection of the diffuse emission revealed a radial
temperature gradient that is hot in the center, drops to a minimum at about
20-50"" (1.6-4.1 kpc), and rises again in the outer regions. The diffuse
emission appears to require a two-temperature model with heavy element
abundance ratios that differ from the solar values. We have verified the
existence of faint radial features extending out from the core of NGC 4649 that
had previously been seen with Chandra. The fingers are morphologically similar
to radial features seen in hydrodynamic simulations of cooling flows in
elliptical galaxies. We also find evidence for a longer, previously undetected
filament that extends to the northeastern edge of NGC 4649. We conclude that
the filament may be the result of a tidal interaction, possibly with NGC 4647,

where the whole GRB jet consists of many emitting sub-shells. One may expect

  However, we found that the tail is not spiky but is decaying roughly
monotonically. The global decay slope of the tail is not so much affected by
the local angular inhomogeneity but affected by the global sub-shell energy
distribution. The fact that steepening breaks appeared in some events prefers
the structured jets. If the angular size of the emitting sub-shell is around
0.01-0.02 rad, some bumps or fluctuations appear in the tail emission observed
frequently in long GRBs. If the parameter differences of sub-shell properties
are large, the tail has frequent changes of the temporal slope observed in a
few bursts. Therefore, the multiple emitting sub-shell model has the advantage
of explaining the small-scale structure in the observed rapid decay phase.

highest Lsx,tot values are reached by core galaxies; this is explained with
their being central dominant galaxies of groups, subclusters or clusters, in

to those of classical AGNs, in this sample are hosted only by core galaxies; at
low luminosity AGN levels, Lhx,nuc is independent of the central stellar

sharply truncates the high end of the galaxy luminosity function. Most of the
recent models for halting cooling in clusters have focused on AGN heating, but
the actual heating mechanism has remained mysterious. Here we present a
framework for AGN heating derived from a Chandra survey of gas entropy profiles
within cluster cores. This set of observations strongly suggests that the inner
parts of cluster cores are shock-heated every ~10^8 years by intermittent AGN
outbursts, driven by a kinetic power output of ~ 10^45 erg/sec and lasting at
least 10^7 years. Beyond ~30 kpc these shocks decay to sound waves, releasing
buoyant bubbles that heat the core's outer parts. Between heating episodes,
cooling causes the core to relax toward an asymptotic pure-cooling profile. The
density distribution in this asymptotic profile is sufficiently peaked that the
AGN shock does not cause a core entropy inversion, allowing the cluster core to
retain a strong iron abundance gradient, as observed.

energy of the system and study the phase diagram both at zero and at finite

temperature phase diagram of the EBH model possesses a dual structure in the
Mott insulating regime. Namely, for specific ranges of the lattice parameters,
a density wave phase characterizes the system at integer fillings, with domains
of alternating mean occupation numbers that are the atomic counterparts of the
domains of staggered magnetizations in an antiferromagnetic phase. We show as
well that in the EBH model, a zero-temperature quantum phase transition to pair
superfluidity is in principle possible, but completely suppressed at lowest
order in the lattice attenuation factor. Finally, we determine the possible
occurrence of the different phases as a function of the experimentally
controllable lattice parameters.

  Economics 2005, September 15-16, Lille, France",,,,"cs.MA cs.CE",,"  Simulations of artificial stock markets were considered as early as 1964 and
multi-agent ones were introduced as early as 1989. Starting the early 90's,
collaborations of economists and physicists produced increasingly realistic
simulation platforms. Currently, the market stylized facts are easily
reproduced and one has now to address the realistic details of the Market
Microstructure and of the Traders Behaviour. This calls for new methods and
tools capable of bridging smoothly between simulations and experiments in
economics.
  We propose here the following Avatar-Based Method (ABM). The subjects
implement and maintain their Avatars (programs encoding their personal decision
making procedures) on NatLab, a market simulation platform. Once these
procedures are fed in a computer edible format, they can be operationally used
as such without the need for belabouring, interpreting or conceptualising them.
Thus ABM short-circuits the usual behavioural economics experiments that search
for the psychological mechanisms underlying the subjects behaviour. Finally,
ABM maintains a level of objectivity close to the classical behaviourism while
extending its scope to subjects' decision making mechanisms.
  We report on experiments where Avatars designed and maintained by humans from
different backgrounds (including real traders) compete in a continuous
double-auction market. We hope this unbiased way of capturing the adaptive
evolution of real subjects behaviour may lead to a new kind of behavioural
economics experiments with a high degree of reliability, analysability and
reproducibility.

experiments such as test of the equivalence principle, search for time
variation of the gravitational constant, and determines value of several metric
gravity parameters. These gravitational physics parameters cause both secular
and periodic effects on the lunar orbit that are detectable with LLR.
Furthermore, LLR contributes to the determination of Earth orientation
parameters (EOP) such as nutation, precession (including relativistic
precession), polar motion, and UT1. The corresponding LLR EOP series is three
decades long. LLR can be used for the realization of both the terrestrial and
selenocentric reference frames. The realization of a dynamically defined
inertial reference frame, in contrast to the kinematically realized frame of
VLBI, offers new possibilities for mutual cross-checking and confirmation.

  ""Lasers, Clocks, and Drag-Free"", ZARM, Bremen, Germany, 30 May - 1 June 2005",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The Doppler tracking data from two deep-space spacecraft, Pioneer 10 and 11,
show an anomalous blueshift, which has been dubbed the ""Pioneer anomaly"". The
effect is most commonly interpreted as a real deceleration of the spacecraft -
an interpretation that faces serious challenges from planetary ephemerides. The
Pioneer anomaly could as well indicate an unknown effect on the radio signal
itself. Several authors have made suggestions how such a blueshift could be
related to cosmology. We consider this interpretation of the Pioneer anomaly
and study the impact of an anomalous blueshift on the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA), a planned joint ESA-NASA mission aiming at the detection
of gravitational waves. The relative frequency shift (proportional to the light
travel time) for the LISA arm length is estimated to 10E-16, which is much
bigger than the expected amplitude of gravitational waves. The anomalous
blueshift enters the LISA signal in two ways, as a small term folded with the
gravitational wave signal, and as larger term at low frequencies. A detail
analysis shows that both contributions remain undetectable and do not impair
the gravitational-wave detection. This suggests that the Pioneer anomaly will
have to be tested in the outer Solar system regardless if the effect is caused
by an anomalous blueshift or by a real force.

strings. We argue that primordial black holes(PBHs) may have formed from loops
of the necklaces, if there exist stable winding states, such as coils and
cycloops. Unlike the standard scenario of PBH formation from string loops, in
which the kinetic energy plays important role when strings collapse into black
holes, the PBH formation may occur in our scenario after necklaces have
dissipated their kinetic energy. Then, the significant difference appears in
the production ratio. In the standard scenario, the production ratio $f$
becomes a tiny fraction $f\sim 10^{-20}$, however it becomes $f \sim 1$ in our
case. On the other hand, the typical mass of the PBHs is much smaller than the
standard scenario, if they are produced in the same epoch. As the two
mechanisms may work at the same time, the necklaces may have more than one
channel of the gravitational collapse. Although the result obtained in this
paper depends on the evolution of the dimensionless parameter $r$, the
existence of the winding state could be a serious problem in some cases. Since
the existence of the winding state in brane models is due to the existence of a
non-tivial circle in the compactified space, the PBH formation can be used to
probe the structure of the compactified space. Black holes produced by this
mechanism may have peculiar properties.

class of brane inflationary models. The most interesting story is that cosmic
strings in brane models are distinguished in future cosmological observations.
If the strings in brane models are branes or superstrings that can move along
compactified space, and also if there are degenerated vacua along the
compactified space, kinks interpolate between degenerated vacua become
``beads'' on the strings. In this case, strings turn into necklaces. In the
case that the compact manifold in not simply connected, a string loop that
winds around a nontrivial circle is stable due to the topological reason. Since
the existence of the (quasi-)degenerated vacua and the nontrivial circle is a
common feature of the brane models, it is important to study cosmological
constraints on the cosmic necklaces and the stable winding states. In this
paper, we consider dark matter production from loops of the cosmic necklaces.
Our result suggests that necklaces can put stringent bound on certain kinds of
brane models.

assumption that three neutrino masses are nearly degenerate, we calculate
radiative corrections to $V_0$ and $V'_0$ in their evolution down to the
electroweak scale ($\sim 10^2$ GeV). Three mixing angles of $V_0$ or $V'_0$ are
essentially stable against radiative corrections in the standard model (SM). In
the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), however, $V_0$ is in general
disfavored and $V'_0$ can be compatible with current neutrino oscillation data
if its two Majorana phases $\alpha^{}_1$ and $\alpha^{}_2$ are properly
fine-tuned. We also find that it is possible to radiatively generate the
CP-violating phase $\delta$ from $\alpha^{}_1$ and $\alpha^{}_2$, and \delta
may keep on staying at its fixed point in either the SM or the MSSM.

particular including e.g. F^6-terms. The full string S-matrix can be expressed
by six generalized multiple hypergeometric functions (triple hypergeometric
functions), which in the effective action play an important role in arranging
the higher order alpha' gauge interaction terms with six external legs (like
F^6, D^4 F^4, D^2 F^5, D^6 F^4, D^2 F^6, ...).
  A systematic and efficient method is found to calculate tree-level string
amplitudes by equating seemingly different expressions for one and the same
string S-matrix: Comparable to Riemann identities appearing in string-loop
calculations, we find an intriguing way of using world-sheet supersymmetry to
generate a system of non-trivial equations for string tree-level amplitudes.
These equations result in algebraic identities between different multiple
hypergeometric functions. Their (six-dimensional) solution gives the
ingredients of the string S-matrix. We derive material relevant for any open
string six-point scattering process: relations between triple hypergeometric
functions, their integral representations and their
alpha'-(momentum)-expansions given by (generalized) Euler-Zagier sums or
(related) Witten zeta-functions.

strength tensors and describes interaction of tensor gauge fields of arbitrary

of the Yang-Mills theory the vector gauge boson becomes a member of a bigger
family of tensor gauge bosons.

two Lagrangians and exhibits enhanced local gauge invariance with double number
of gauge parameters. This allows to eliminate all negative norm states of the

the mean of a counting process with ``panel count'' data. The basic model
assumption is that the conditional mean function of the counting process is of
the form $E\{\mathbb{N}(t)|Z\}=\exp(\beta_0^TZ)\Lambda_0(t)$ where $Z$ is a
vector of covariates and $\Lambda_0$ is the baseline mean function. The ``panel
count'' observation scheme involves observation of the counting process
$\mathbb{N}$ for an individual at a random number $K$ of random time points;
both the number and the locations of these time points may differ across
individuals. We study semiparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood and maximum
likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters $(\beta_0,\Lambda_0)$ derived
on the basis of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process assumption. The
pseudo-likelihood estimator is fairly easy to compute, while the maximum
likelihood estimator poses more challenges from the computational perspective.
We study asymptotic properties of both estimators assuming that the
proportional mean model holds, but dropping the Poisson process assumption used
to derive the estimators. In particular we establish asymptotic normality for
the estimators of the regression parameter $\beta_0$ under appropriate
hypotheses. The results show that our estimation procedures are robust in the
sense that the estimators converge to the truth regardless of the underlying
counting process.

neighboring units. As a first approximation to the complete description of the

the divergence of the scattered wave, while the rigorous analysis uses the

superinfection (delayed secondary infection) scenarios in the early stages

emerging molecular biology findings. The immune response induces a competition
among similar phenotypes, leading to differentiation (quasi-speciation), escape
dynamics and complex oscillations of viral strain abundance. We found that the
quasispecies dynamics after superinfection or coinfection has time scales of
several months and becomes even slower when the immune system response is weak.

for the reduction of any superposition states in the brain through the mind or

changed within the complex architecture of the eye in a continuous linear
process initially for most of the superposed photons, followed by a
discontinuous nonlinear collapse process later for any remaining superposed
photons, thereby guaranteeing that only final, measured information is

transitions between a normal conductor and a superconductor in the BCS and
eta-pairing models and between a Mott-insulator and a superfluid in the
Bose-Hubbard model are directly related to the amount of entanglement existent
in the ground state of each system. This gives a physical meaningful
interpretation to these QOP, which shows the intrinsically quantum nature of
the phase transitions considered.
