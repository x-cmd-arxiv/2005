the range -23.5< M_i'<-17.5, is well fitted by a Schechter function with
M*i'=-21.3 +/- 0.4 and alpha = -0.6 +/- 0.3 or a Gaussian function centered on

in the luminosity function at M_r'=-18 mag, as also observed for other

at least 19 galaxies with magnitudes between m_3 and m_3 + 2, within a surveyed
circular area of radius 625 kpc centered on the peak of the x-ray emission. Its
mass, ~3.0 10^14 M_0, M/L of 507 M_sol/L_B_sol and L_X of 6.3 10^43 ergs/s

accreted the more luminous ~L* former members of the group. Although dynamical
friction and subsequent merging are probably the processes responsible for the
lack of bright galaxies in the system, for the fainter members, there must be
another mechanism in action (perhaps tidal disruption) to deplete the fossil
group from intermediate-luminosity galaxies M_r' ~ -18.

qualitatively consistent with models where the GRB rate is proportional to the

gamma-ray bursts (SHBs) is one of the most exciting recent astronomical
discoveries. Indications that SHB progenitors belong to old stellar
populations, in contrast to those of the long-soft GRBs, provide a strong clue
about their physical nature. Definitive conclusions however are limited by the
small number of SHBs with known hosts. Here, we present our investigation of
SHBs previously localized by the interplanetary network (IPN) using new and
archival optical and X-ray observations. We show that we can likely identify
the host galaxies/clusters for additional two bursts, significantly increasing
the sample of SHBs with known hosts and/or distances. In particular, we
determine that the bright SHB 790613 occurred within the rich galaxy cluster
Abell 1892, making it probably the nearest SHB currently known. We show that
the brightest galaxy within the error box of SHB 000607, at z=0.14, is most
likely the host galaxy of this event. Additionally, we rule out the existence
of galaxy overdensities (down to ~21mag) near the locations of two other SHBs,
and set a lower limit on their probable redshift. We combine our SHB sample
with events discovered recently by the Swift and HETE-2 missions, and
investigate the properties of the extended sample. Comparison to SNe Ia shows
that the progenitors of SHBs are typically older, implying a typical life time
of several Gy. We also show that it is unlikely that there is a significant
population of progenitors with life time shorter than 1Gy. This result
disfavors the popular model of NS-NS mergers as the progenitors of SHBs.

with simulations that use the fully compressible equations validate the low
Mach number model in regimes where both are applicable. Comparisons to
simulations based on the more traditional anelastic approximation also
demonstrate the agreement of these models in the regime for which the anelastic
approximation is valid. For low Mach number flows with potentially finite
amplitude variations in density and temperature, the low Mach number model
overcomes the limitations of each of the more traditional models and can serve
as the basis for an accurate and efficient simulation tool.

emission-line and infrared star formation rates (SFR_{opt} & SFR_{IR},
respectively). Direct comparison of these SFR diagnostics reveals that our
sample exhibits a wide range of extinction (1.0<Av<4.0 mag). This is after
removing spectroscopic and IRAC color-selected AGN candidates that account for
12% of the sample. Objects with SFRs of a few solar masses per year have Av
values consistent with those of normal spirals (Av~1.0 mag). By contrast, LIRGs
at z>1, which make up a large fraction of our sample, have SFR~100 M_{sun}/yr
and <Av>~2.5 mag. This translates to a 97% mean attenuation of the [OII]
forbidden line doublet, with the most extreme sources having as much as 99.7%
of their [OII] line flux extinguished by dust. Based on a SFR_{IR}/SFR_{opt}
diagnostic, we derive an IR-luminosity-dependent Av^{IR} function

our emission line luminosities. Application of this correction results in a
correlation between SFR_{IR} and SFR_{opt} that has a dispersion of 0.2 dex.
Investigation of the Av dependence on redshift reveals that for a fixed L_{IR},
there is no significant Av evolution. The mean attenuation of our sample is

how to obtain the typical profile, as well as the probability distribution and
mean profile for the spherically averaged radial velocity. Two probability
distributions are obtained: a first one is derived using a simple assumption,
that is, if Q is the virial radius in Lagrangian coordinates, then the enclosed
linear contrast delta_l(q,Q) must satisfy the condition that delta_l(q=Q) =
delta_vir, where delta_vir is the linear density contrast within the virial
radius Rvir at the moment of virialization. Then we introduce an additional
constraint to obtain a more accurate P(delta,r) which reproduces to a higher
degree of precision the distribution of the spherically averaged enclosed
density found in the simulations. This new constraint is delta_l(q,Q) <
delta_vir for all q > Q, which means that there are no radii larger than Rvir
where the density contrast is larger than that used to define the virial
radius. Finally, we compare in detail our theoretical predictions for the

potentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sources
in catalogues typically selected at >3.0-3.5sigma. Here, we develop and apply a
dual-survey extraction technique to SCUBA and MAMBO images of the Lockman Hole.
Cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of SMGs is more robust than previous samples,
with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint SMGs (beneath and around the
confusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. The effective flux
limit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-GHz image. The former is
sensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latter
probes the z<3 regime. A high fraction of our robust SMGs (~80%) have radio
counterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggests
that very distant SMGs (z>>3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of the
bright SMG population. This implies that almost all of the bright SMG
population is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. We use
these radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positional
uncertainty in SMG catalogues. We then go on to outline the acquisition of
redshifts for radio-identified SMGs, from sample selection in the submm, to
counterpart selection in the radio and optical/IR, to slit placement on
spectrograph masks. We determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample of
six secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14
+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/or
less reliable redshifts. These figures are consistent with previous estimates,

way to probe the properties of the foreground matter through dust extinction
and gravitational lensing. In this paper the feasibility of measuring the dust
extinction properties is investigated using the backlitting of QSOs. We test
our method to search for QSOs affected by intervening extinction, by matching
the coordinates in the SDSS QSO DR3 catalogue with the New York University
Value-Added Galaxy Catalog. In total, 164 QSO-galaxy pairs were found with a
distance of less than 30 kpc between the galaxy centre and the QSO
line-of-sight at the galaxy redshift. Investigating the QSO colours with
multiband SDSS photometry, two pairs with galaxy redshifts z < 0.08 were found
to be particularly interesting in that the QSOs show evidence of heavy Galactic
type extinction with R_v ~ 3.1 at very large optical radii in the foreground
spiral galaxies. With the available data, it remains inconclusive whether the
two pairs can be explained as statistical colour outliers, by host extinction
or if they provide evidence of dust in the outskirts of spiral galaxies. Deeper
galaxy catalogues and/or higher resolution follow-up QSO spectra would help in
resolving this problem. We also analyse five QSOs reported in the literature
with spectroscopic absorption features originating from an intervening system.
These systems are at higher redshifts than the other two and we find in most
cases significantly lower best fit values of R_v. The wide range of preferred
values of R_v found, although affected by substantial uncertainties, already
indicates that the dust properties in other galaxies may be different from the
Milky Way. Furthermore, the available data suggests a possible evolution in the
dust properties with redshift, with lower R_v at high z.

previously published observational results through comparison with chemically
consistent spectrophotometric evolutionary synthesis models in order to gain
further clues to the evolutionary history of the galaxies in this group. In
order to reduce the number of free parameters, we considered the simplest case
of a single burst of star formation turned on after 11 - 12 Gyr of undisturbed
galaxy evolution. However, we also briefly explore the effect of multiple,
interaction-induced bursts of star formation. We find that the two spiral
galaxies are consistent with interaction induced strong starbursts switched on
\~ 40 to 180 Myr ago and still active. For the early-type galaxy a <~ 0.9 - 1.3
Gyr old star formation event (depending on the considered model) appears
consistent with observed properties. The comparison with models cannot rule out
the possibility that this galaxy is already the result of a merger.
Alternatively, a star formation episode in this galaxy might have been
triggered by a gas inflow as a consequence of the interaction with the
companion galaxies. Estimates of galaxy masses are derived from the comparison
with the models. Finally our results are discussed in comparison with other
well studied poor galaxy systems.

approximate Hamiltonian from which the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of

infinitely extended harmonic random valley, together with the universal
multiplicity of such valleys, gives an accurate first-principles account of the
measured thermodynamic properties of the elemental liquids at melt. In the
present paper, V-T theory is extended to non-equilibrium properties, through an
application to the dynamic structure factor S(q,w). It was previously shown
that the vibrational contribution alone accurately accounts for the Brillouin
peak dispersion curve for liquid sodium, as compared both with MD calculations
and inelastic x-ray scattering data. Here it is argued that the major effects
of transits will be to disrupt correlations within the normal mode vibrational
motion, and to provide an additional source of inelastic scattering. We
construct a parameterized model for these effects, and show that it is capable
of fitting MD results for S(q,w) in liquid sodium. A small discrepancy between
model and MD at large q is attributed to multimode vibrational scattering. In
comparison, mode coupling theory formulates S(q,w) in terms of processes
through which density fluctuations decay. While mode coupling theory is also
capable of modeling S(q,w) very well, V-T theory is the more universal since it
expresses all statistical averages, thermodynamic functions and time
correlation functions alike, in terms of the same motional constituents,

state of electron shells interacting via the Coulomb potential; however one can
also study crystalline ground states of particles interacting with other
potentials. We focus here on long range power law interactions of the form
1/r^gamma (0 < \gamma < 2), with the classic Thomson problem given by gamma=1.
At large R/a, where R is the sphere radius and a is the particle spacing, the
problem can be reformulated as a continuum elastic model that depends on the
Young's modulus of particles packed in the plane and the universal (independent
of the pair potential) geometrical interactions between disclination defects.
The energy of the continuum model can be expressed as an expansion in powers of
the total number of particles, M sim (R/a)^2, with coefficients explicitly
related to both geometric and potential-dependent terms. For icosahedral
configurations of twelve 5-fold disclinations, the first non-trivial
coefficient of the expansion agrees with explicit numerical evaluation for
discrete particle arrangements to 4 significant digits; the discrepancy in the
5th digit arises from a contribution to the energy that is sensitive to the
particular icosadeltahedral configuration and that is neglected in the
continuum calculation. In the limit of a very large number of particles, an
instability toward grain boundaries can be understood in terms of a
""Debye{--}Huckel"" solution, where dislocations have continuous Burgers' vector
""charges"". Discrete dislocations in grain boundaries for intermediate particle

spheres and non-adsorbing ideal polymer chains in a common solvent using free
volume theory. The effective interaction between charged colloids in an aqueous
salt solution is described by a screened-Coulomb pair potential, which
supplements the pure hard-sphere interaction. The ideal polymer chains are
treated as spheres that are excluded from the colloids by a hard-core
interaction, whereas the interaction between two ideal chains is set to zero.
In addition, we investigate the phase behaviour of charged colloid-polymer
mixtures in computer simulations, using the two-body (Asakura-Oosawa pair
potential) approximation to the effective one-component Hamiltonian of the
charged colloids. Both our results obtained from simulations and from free
volume theory show similar trends. We find that the screened-Coulomb repulsion
counteracts the effect of the effective polymer-mediated attraction. For
mixtures of small polymers and relatively large charged colloidal spheres, the
fluid-crystal transition shifts to significantly larger polymer concentrations
with increasing range of the screened-Coulomb repulsion. For relatively large
polymers, the effect of the screened-Coulomb repulsion is weaker. The resulting
fluid-fluid binodal is only slightly shifted towards larger polymer
concentrations upon increasing the range of the screened-Coulomb repulsion. In
conclusion, our results show that the miscibility of dispersions containing
charged colloids and neutral non-adsorbing polymers increases, upon increasing
the range of the screened-Coulomb repulsion, or upon lowering the salt
concentration, especially when the polymers are small compared to the colloids.

the whole energy region of the Mn $L_{2,3}$ white lines for three prototypical
Mn/Ag(001) systems: (i) a Mn impurity in Ag, (ii) an adsorbed Mn monolayer on
Ag, and (iii) a thick Mn film. The calculated RXES spectra depend strongly on
the excitation energy. At $L_3$ excitation, the spectra of all three systems
are dominated by the elastic peak. For excitation energies around $L_2$, and
between $L_3$ and $L_2$, however, most of the spectral weight comes from
inelastic x-ray scattering. The line shape of these inelastic ``satellite''
structures changes considerably between the three considered Mn/Ag systems, a
fact that may be attributed to changes in the bonding nature of the Mn-$d$
orbitals. The system-dependence of the RXES spectrum is thus found to be much
stronger than that of the corresponding absorption spectrum. Our results
suggest that RXES in the Mn $L_{2,3}$ region may be used as a sensitive probe
of the local environment of Mn atoms.

notion of controllability for fuzzy states, we then provide a necessary and
sufficient condition for a set of fuzzy states to be controllable. We also find
that event-based control and state-based control are not equivalent and further
discuss the relationship between them. Finally, we examine the possibility of
driving a fuzzy discrete event system under control from a given initial state
to a prescribed set of fuzzy states and then keeping it there indefinitely.

  Quantum Gravity","68 pages, 9 figures",,,,"gr-qc quant-ph",,"  Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. General
relativity is a deterministic theory but where the causal structure is dynamic.
It is reasonable to expect that quantum gravity will be a probabilistic theory
with dynamic causal structure. The purpose of this paper is to present a
framework for such a probability calculus. We define an operational notion of
space-time, this being composed of elementary regions. Central to this
formalism is an object we call the causaloid. This object captures information
about causal structure implicit in the data by quantifying the way in which the
number of measurements required to establish a state for a composite region is
reduced when there is a causal connection between the component regions. This
formalism puts all elementary regions on an equal footing. It does not require
that we impose fixed causal structure. In particular, it is not necessary to
assume the existence of a background time. Remarkably, given the causaloid, we
can calculate all relevant probabilities and so the causaloid is sufficient to
specify the predictive aspect of a physical theory. We show how certain
causaloids can be represented by suggestive diagrams and we show how to
represent both classical probability theory and quantum theory by a causaloid.
We do not give a causaloid formulation for general relativity though we
speculate that this is possible. The work presented here suggests a research
program aimed at finding a theory of quantum gravity. The idea is to use the
causaloid formalism along with principles taken from the two theories to marry
the dynamic causal structure of general relativity with the probabilistic
structure of quantum theory.

its own gravity moves on an accelerated world line in the background spacetime
of the large black hole. The acceleration is produced by the body's
gravitational self-force, which is constructed from the body's retarded
gravitational field. The adiabatic approximation to the gravitational
self-force is obtained instead from the half-retarded minus half-advanced
field; it is known to produce the same dissipative effects as the true
self-force. We argue that the adiabatic approximation is limited, because it
discards important conservative terms which lead to the secular evolution of
some orbital elements. We argue further that this secular evolution has
measurable consequences; in particular, it affects the phasing of the orbit and
the phasing of the associated gravitational wave. Our argument rests on a
simple toy model involving a point electric charge moving slowly in the weak
gravitational field of a central mass; the charge is also subjected to its
electromagnetic self-force. In this simple context the true self-force is known
explicitly and it can cleanly be separated into conservative and
radiation-reaction pieces. We observe that the conservative part of the
self-force produces a secular regression of the orbit's periapsis. We explain
how the conclusions reached on the basis of the toy model can be extended to
the gravitational self-force, and to fast motions and strong fields. While the
limitations of the adiabatic approximation are quite severe in a post-Newtonian
context in which the motion is slow and the gravitational field weak, they
appear to be less so for rapid motions and strong fields.

General Relativity, effective Einstein equations govern the regional and the
global dynamics of averaged scalar variables of cosmological models. A
particular solution may be characterized by a cosmic equation of state. In this
paper it is pointed out that a globally static averaged dust model is
conceivable without employing a compensating cosmological constant. Much in the
spirit of Einstein's original model we discuss consequences for the global, but
also for the regional properties of this cosmology. We then consider the wider
class of globally stationary cosmologies that are conceivable in the presented
framework. All these models are based on exact solutions of the averaged
Einstein equations and provide examples of cosmologies in an out-of-equilibrium
state, which we characterize by an information-theoretical measure. It is shown
that such cosmologies preserve high-magnitude kinematical fluctuations and so
tend to maintain their global properties. The same is true for a
$\Lambda-$driven cosmos in such a state despite of exponential expansion. We
outline relations to inflationary scenarios, and put the Dark Energy problem
into perspective. Here, it is argued, on the grounds of the discussed
cosmologies, that a classical explanation of Dark Energy through backreaction
effects is theoretically conceivable, if the matter-dominated Universe emerged
from a non-perturbative state in the vicinity of the stationary solution. We
also discuss a number of caveats that furnish strong counter arguments in the
framework of structure formation in a perturbed Friedmannian model.

following called S, describes a spacetime when its elements are constrained by
certain integrability conditions and due to a theorem by Cartan this set gives
a complete local description of the spacetime. The system obtained by imposing
the integrability conditions and Einstein's equations can be reduced to an
integrable system of five coupled first order ordinary differential equations.
The general solution is tilted and describes a fluid with expansion, shear and
vorticity. With the help of standard bases for Bianchi V and I the full line
element is found in terms of the elements in S. We then construct the solutions
to the linearized equations around the open Friedmann model. The full system is
also studied numerically and the perturbative solutions agree well with the
numerical ones in the appropriate domains. We also give some examples of

by recent attempts to understand the nonperturbative aspects of QCD at
temperatures T~ a few times the deconfinement temperature Tc. We focus on the
pure gauge theory, and ask whether the deficit in pressure and entropy, with
respect to their free-gas values, is particular to SU(3). We find that the
deficit in SU(4),SU(8) for T>= 2Tc,1.6 Tc, respectively, is remarkably close to
that of SU(3). This suggests a similar deficit for SU(oo), which is fortunate
since this theory is simpler, and can serve to constrain the possible dynamics
underlying the deficits.
  In the second part we seek for signs of a Hagedorn temperature T_H in pure
lattice SU(N) gauge theories with N=8,10,12. Since one expects T_H>Tc, we
measure masses of strings in the metastable confined phase above Tc, and
extrapolatethem to zero to estimate T_H. For SU(12) we find that
T_H/Tc=1.116(9), when we extrapolate with a critical exponentof the three
dimensional XY model, which seems to be preferred over a mean field exponent by
our data.

the first obtained by requiring the vanishing of the pseudoscalar meson mass
m_PS for standard Wilson fermions and the second by requiring restoration of
parity at non-zero value of the twisted mass mu and subsequently extrapolating
to mu=0. Depending on the choice of the critical mass we simulate at values of
beta in [5.7,6.45], for a range of pseudoscalar meson masses 250 MeV < m_PS < 1
GeV and we perform the continuum limit for the pseudoscalar meson decay
constant f_PS and various hadron masses (vector meson m_V, baryon octet m_oct
and baryon decuplet m_dec) at fixed value of r_0 m_PS. For both definitions of
the critical mass, lattice artifacts are consistent with O(a) improvement.
However, with the second definition, large O(a^2) discretization errors present
at small quark mass with the first definition are strongly suppressed. The
results in the continuum limit are in very good agreement with those from the

states of reservoir driven quantum systems. This formulation is centred on the
large scale properties of the locally conserved hydrodynamical observables, and
our basic assumptions comprise (a) a chaoticity hypothesis for the nonconserved
currents carried by these observables, (b) an extension of Onsager's regression
hypothesis to the fluctuations about nonequilibrium states, and (c) a certain
mesoscopic local equilibrium hypothesis. On this basis we obtain a picture
wherein the fluctuations of the hydrodynamical observables about a
nonequilibrium steady state execute a Gaussian Markov process of a generalized
Onsager-Machlup type, which is completely determined by the position dependent
transport coefficients and the equilibrium entropy function of the system. This
picture reveals that the transport coefficients satisfy a generalized form of
the Onsager reciprocity relations in the nonequilibrium situation and that the
spatial correlations of the hydrodynamical observables are generically of long
range. This last result constitutes a model-independent generalization of that
obtained for special classical stochastic systems and marks a striking
difference between the steady nonequilibrium and equilibrium states, since it
is only at critical points that the latter carry long range correlations.

latter requiring the use infinite dimensional spaces. It also allows a direct
application of the local index theorem for families of elliptic operators due
to J.-M. Bismut, H. Gillet and C. Soul\'{e}. The link between determinant line
bundles equipped with the Quillen\'s metric and the so-called holomorphic
factorization property will be addressed in the case of free spin $j$ b-c

least one more new point symmetry (possibly a hidden symmetry of Type II). 2)
First, reduction paths of the fourth order differential equations with four

third order equation possessing two-parameter symmetry group appears are
singled out and followed until a first order equation possessing one known

Fredholm integral equations of the first kind with Hermitian and
square-integrable kernels, and with data corrupted by additive noise, is
considered. Instead of using a variational regularization of Tikhonov type,
based on a priori global bounds, we propose a method of truncation of
eigenfunction expansions that can be proved to converge asymptotically, in the
sense of the $L^2$--norm, in the limit of noise vanishing. Here we extend the
probabilistic counterpart of this procedure by constructing a probabilistically
regularized solution without assuming any structure of order on the sequence of
the Fourier coefficients of the data. This probabilistic approach allows us to
use the statistical tools proper of time-series analysis, and in this way we
attain a new regularizing algorithm, which is illustrated by some numerical
examples. Finally, a comparison with solutions obtained by the means of the
variational regularization exhibits how some intrinsic limits of the
variational-based techniques can be overcome.

Supposing $H$ appropriately normalized (by affine coordinate changes in the

change, using the rate-and-state model of Dieterich [1994].We show that an
exponential stress distribution Pt(au) ~exp(-tautau_0) gives an Omori law decay
of aftershocks with time ~1/t^p, with an exponent p=1-A sigma_n/tau_0, where A
is a parameter of the rate-and-state friction law, and \sigma_n the normal
stress. Omori exponent p thus decreases if the stress ""heterogeneity"" tau_0
decreases. We also invert the stress distribution P(tau) from the seismicity
rate R(t), assuming that the stress does not change with time. We apply this
method to a synthetic stress map, using the (modified) scale invariant ""k^2""
slip model [Herrero and Bernard, 1994]. We generate synthetic aftershock
catalogs from this stress change.The seismicity rate on the rupture area shows
a huge increase at short times, even if the stress decreases on average.
Aftershocks are clustered in the regions of low slip, but the spatial
distribution is more diffuse than for a simple slip dislocation. Because the
stress field is very heterogeneous, there are many patches of positive stress
changes everywhere on the fault.This stochastic slip model gives a Gaussian
stress distribution, but nevertheless produces an aftershock rate which is very
close to Omori's law, with an effective p<=1, which increases slowly with time.
We obtain a good estimation of the stress distribution for realistic catalogs,
when we constrain the shape of the distribution. However, there are probably
other factors which also affect the temporal decay of aftershocks with time. In
particular, heterogeneity of A\sigma_n can also modify the parameters p and c
of Omori's law. Finally, we show that stress shadows are very difficult to
observe in a heterogeneous stress context.

computing the time-dependent vertical crustal movement and geoid change due to
coseismic deformations and postseismic relaxation effects. Seismic activity can
affect both the absolute sealevel, by changing the Earth gravity field and
hence the geoid height, and the relative sealevel, i.e. the radial distance
between seafloor and geoid level. By using comprehensive seismic catalogues we
assess the net effect of seismicity on tidal relative sealevel measurements as
well as on the global oceanic surfaces, and we obtain an estimate of absolute
sealevel variations of seismic origin.
  Our results confirm that, on a global scale, most of the signal is associated
with few giant thrust events, and that RSL estimates obtained using tide-gauge
data can be sensibly affected by the seismic driven sealevel signal.
  The recent measures of sealevel obtained by satellite altimetry show a wide
regional variation of sealevel trends over the oceanic surfaces, with the
largest deviations from the mean trend occurring in tectonically active
regions. While our estimates of average absolute sealevel variations turn out
to be orders of magnitude smaller than the satellite measured variations, we
can still argue that mass redistribution associated with aseismic tectonic
processes may contribute to the observed regional variability of sealevel
variations.

account for the genetic regulation of such systems, especially those resulting

models are dynamically similar - the initial motion of the inducible enzymes in
all the models is described by Lotka-Volterra equations for competing species.
The dynamic similarity occurs because in all the models, the inducible enzymes
possess properties characteristic of competing species: Their synthesis is
autocatalytic, and they inhibit each other. Despite this dynamic similarity,
the models vary with respect to the range of dynamics captured. The Brandt et
al model captures only the diauxic growth pattern, whereas the remaining two
models capture both diauxic and non-diauxic growth patterns. The models also
differ with respect to the mechanisms that generate the mutual inhibition
between the enzymes. In the Narang model, the mutual inhibition occurs because
the enzymes for each substrate enhance the dilution of the enzymes for the
other substrate. In the Thattai & Shraiman model, the mutual inhibition is
entirely due to competition for the phosphoryl groups.

introduced and some of their properties are derived. These properties ensure
certain simple form for the measurements involved in realizing an unambiguous
unitary quantum channel. Error correction and unambiguous error correction with
nonzero probability are discussed in terms of unambiguous unitary quantum
channels. We not only re-derive the well-known condition for a set of errors to
be correctable with certainty, but also obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for the errors caused by a noisy channel to be correctable with any
nonzero probability. Dense coding with a partially entangled state can also be
viewed as an unambiguous unitary quantum channel when all messages are required
to be transmitted with equal probability of success, the maximal achievable
probability of success is derived and the optimum protocol is also obtained.

  Accepted for publication in Proc. of SPIE",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A method of quantum tomography of arbitrary spin particle states is developed
on the basis of the root approach. It is shown that the set of mutually
complementary distributions of angular momentum projections can be naturally
described by a set of basis functions based on the Kravchuk polynomials. The
set of Kravchuk basis functions leads to a multi-parametric statistical
distribution that generalizes the binomial distribution. In order to analyze a
statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics, we investigated the
likelihood equation and the statistical properties of the obtained estimates.
The conclusions of the analytical researches are approved by the results of
numerical calculations.

A 71}, 052102, (2005)] a hypothesis has been pursued that the loss of
information associated with the quantum evolution of pure states, quantified in
terms of an increase in time of so-called Leipnik's joint entropy, could be a
rather general property shared by many quantum systems. This behavior has been
confirmed for the unconfined model systems and properly tuned initial data
(maximally classical states). We provide two particular examples which indicate
a complexity of the quantum evolution. In the presence of a confining
(harmonic) potential Leipnik's entropy may be non-increasing for maximally
classical initial data. Another choice of initial data implies periodicity in
time of the Leipnik entropy.

viewpoint and by the geometrical method. Especially, besides the ordinary
(rectangular) momentum representation, we provide an explicit derivation for
the other two important representations, called the cylindrically symmetrical
representation and the spherically symmetrical representation, respectively.
These other two representations are relevant to some current photon experiments
in quantum optics. In addition, the latter is useful for us to extract the
information on the quantized black holes. The framework and approach presented
here are also applicable to other particles with arbitrary mass and spin, such
as the particle with spin 1/2.
