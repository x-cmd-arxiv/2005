from 2002 November to 2004 November during calibration, open time and core
program (Galactic Plane Scan) observations. These data provide evidence for
significant spectral variations over the period. In the framework of the
accreting black hole phenomenology, the source was most of the time in the Hard
State and occasionally switched to the so-called ""Intermediate State"". Using
the results of the analysis performed on these data, we present and compare the
spectral properties of the source over the whole energy range (5 keV - 1 MeV)
covered by the high-energy instruments on board INTEGRAL, in both observed
spectral states. Fe line and reflection component evolution occurs with
spectral changes in the hard and soft components. The observed behaviour of
Cygnus X-1 is consistent with the general picture of galactic black holes. Our
results give clues to the physical changes that took place in the system (disc
and corona) at almost constant luminosity during the spectral transitions and
provide new measures of the spectral model parameters. In particular, during
the Intermediate State of 2003 June, we observe in the Cygnus X-1 data a
high-energy tail at several hundred keV in excess of the thermal Comptonization
model which suggests the presence of an additional non-thermal component.

tidally disrupted star we survey the parameter space of the problem and find
the regions in the parameter space where the total disruption of the star or a
partial mass loss take place as a result of fly-by around the black hole. Our
treatment is based on General Relativity, and we consider the range of the
black hole masses where the tidal disruption competes with the relativistic
effect of direct capture of the star by the black hole. We find that our
results can be represented on the plane of specific orbital angular momenta of
the star $(j_{\theta}, j_{\phi})$. We calculate the contours of a given mass
loss of the star on this plane, referred to as the tidal cross sections, for a
given black hole mass $M$, rotational parameter $a$ and inclination of the
trajectory of the star with respect to the black hole equatorial plane. It is
shown that the tidal cross sections can be approximated as circles symmetric
above the axis $j_{\phi}=0$, and shifted with respect to the origin of the
coordinates in direction of negative $j_{\theta}$. The radii and shifts of
these circles are obtained numerically for the black hole masses in the range
$5\cdot 10^{5}M_{\odot}-10^{9}M_{\odot}$ and different values of $a$. It is

viewing angles slightly outside the edge of the region within the jet with
prominent afterglow emission, as predicted previously. This would imply that a
significant fraction of viewers get very little external shock energy along
their line of sight, and, therefore, see a very high $\gamma$-ray to kinetic
energy ratio at early times. The early flat phase in the afterglow light curve
implies, in a rather robust and model independent manner, a very large

crystalline silicates, superimposed on the broad absorption bands at 10 and 18

betray the presence of forsterite (Mg_2SiO_4), the magnesium-rich end member of
the olivines. Previously, crystalline silicates have only been observed in
circumstellar environments. The derived fraction of forsterite to amorphous
silicates is typically 0.1 in these ULIRGs. This is much larger than the upper
limit for this ratio in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way, 0.01. These
results suggest that the timescale for injection of crystalline silicates into
the ISM is short in a merger-driven starburst environment (e.g., as compared to
the total time to dissipate the gas), pointing towards massive stars as a
prominent source of crystalline silicates. Furthermore, amorphization due to
cosmic rays, which is thought to be of prime importance for the local ISM, lags

spectra typical of almost pure buried AGNs, namely, strong absorption features
with very small equivalent-width PAH emission. Besides these three sources, 14
LINER and 3 HII ULIRGs' nuclei show strong absorption features whose absolute
optical depths suggest an energy source more centrally concentrated than the
surrounding dust, such as a buried AGN. In total, 17 out of 27 (63%) LINER and
3 out of 13 (23%) HII ULIRGs' nuclei show some degree of evidence for powerful
buried AGNs, suggesting that powerful buried AGNs may be more common in LINER
ULIRGs than in HII ULIRGs. The evidence of AGNs is found in non-Seyfert ULIRGs
with both warm and cool far-infrared colors. These spectra are compared with
those of 15 ULIRGs' nuclei with optical Seyfert signatures taken for
comparison.The overall spectral properties suggest that the total amount of

image on the sky, but blurred by atmospheric and telescopic effects and also
contaminated with noise. The question that then arises is, given this
incomplete data, what combinations of lens mass distribution and source surface
brightness profile could plausibly have produced this image? This is a classic
example of an inverse problem, and the method for solving it is given by the
framework of Bayesian inference. In this paper we demonstrate the application
of Bayesian inference to the problem of gravitational lens reconstruction, and
illustrate the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations which can be used
when the analytical calculations become too difficult. Previous methods for
performing gravitational lens inversion are seen in a new light, as special
cases of the general approach presented in this paper. Thus, we are able to

and their formation and evolution may be different from that of stars of later
generations. In fact, according to the theory of star formation, Pop III stars
might have very massive components ($\sim 100 - 10000M_\odot$). In this paper,
we compute the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of these Pop III
massive stars. We solve the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino
transfer equations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail.
Unlike supermassive stars ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$), the stars of concern in
this paper become opaque to neutrinos. The collapse is simulated until after an
apparent horizon is formed. We confirm that the neutrino transfer plays a
crucial role in the dynamics of gravitational collapse, and find also that the
$\beta$-equilibration leads to a somewhat unfamiliar evolution of electron
fraction. Contrary to the naive expectation, the neutrino spectrum does not
become harder for more massive stars. This is mainly because the neutrino
cooling is more efficient and the outer core is more massive as the stellar
mass increases. Here the outer core is the outer part of the iron core falling
supersonically. We also evaluate the flux of relic neutrino from Pop III
massive stars. As expected, the detection of these neutrinos is difficult for
the currently operating detectors. However, if ever observed, the spectrum will
enable us to obtain the information on the formation history of Pop III stars.
We investigate 18 models covering the mass range of $300 - 10^4 M_\odot$,
making this study the most detailed numerical exploration of spherical
gravitational collapse of Pop III massive stars. This will also serve as an
important foundation for multi-dimensional investigations.

stellar surface mass density (\mu_*). We find that more massive galaxies
cluster more strongly than less massive galaxies, with the difference
increasing above the characteristic stellar mass of the Schechter mass
function. When divided by physical quantities, galaxies with redder colours,
larger D4000, higher C and larger \mu_* cluster more strongly. The clustering
differences are largest on small scales and for low mass galaxies. At fixed
stellar mass,the dependences of clustering on colour and 4000A break strength
are similar. Different results are obtained when galaxies are split by
concentration or surface density. The dependence of w(r_p) on g-r and D4000
extends out to physical scales that are significantly larger than those of
individual dark matter haloes (> 5 Mpc/h). This large-scale clustering
dependence is not seen for the parameters C or \mu_*. On small scales (< 1
Mpc/h), the amplitude of the correlation function is constant for ``young''
galaxies with 1.1 < D4000< 1.5 and a steeply rising function of age for
``older'' galaxies with D4000>1.5. In contrast, the dependence of the amplitude

results of Jing & B\""orner (2004) for the 2dFGRS catalog. The value of
\sigma_{12} measured at k=1 h/Mpc decreases as a function of increasing galaxy
luminosity for galaxies fainter than L*, before increasing again for the most
luminous galaxies in our sample. Each of the galaxy subsamples selected
according to luminosity or stellar mass is divided into two further subsamples
according to colour, D4000, C and \mu_*. We find that galaxies with redder
colours and higher D4000, C, and \mu_* values have larger PVDs on all scales
and at all luminosities/stellar masses. The dependence of the PVD on parameters
related to recent star formation(colour, D4000) is stronger than on parameters
related to galaxy structure (C, \mu_*), especially on small scales and for
faint galaxies. The reddest galaxies and galaxies with high surface mass
densities and intermediate concentrations have the highest pairwise peculiar
velocities, i.e. these move in the strongest gravitational fields. We conclude
that the faint red population located in rich clusters is responsible for the

25% at H=13, in line with previous results. In addition the |b|>20 counts
display a relatively constant deficit in the counts of 15-20%. We investigate
various possible causes for these results: In order to address the issue of the
model normalisation, we examine faint number counts for the new faint
photometry presented in this work and also for the LCIRS. In each case a
zeropoint is chosen to match that of the 2MASS photometry at bright magnitudes.
We find a large offset between 2MASS and the LCIRS data of 0.28+/-0.01
magnitudes. Applying a consistent zeropoint, the combined faint data is in good
agreement with the homogeneous model prediction used previously. We examine
possible effects arising from unexpected galaxy evolution and photometric
errors and find no evidence for a significant contribution from either.
However, incompleteness in the 2MASS catalogue and in the faint data may have a
significant contribution. Addressing the contribution from large-scale
structure, we estimate the cosmic variance in the bright counts over the APM
survey area and for |b|>20 expected in a LCDM cosmology using 27 LCDM mock
2MASS catalogues. Accounting for the model normalisation uncertainty and taking
an upper limit for the incompleteness, the APM survey area bright counts are in
line with a rare fluctuation in the local galaxy distribution of 2.5 sigma.
However, the |b|>20 counts represent a 4.0 sigma fluctuation, and imply a local
hole which extends over the entire local galaxy distribution and is at odds
with LCDM.

distinguishing feature of this event is the obvious rebrightening at around 1.6
days after the burst. Proposed explanations for the rebrightening mainly
include the two-component jet model and the refreshed shock model, although a
sudden density-jump in the circumburst environment is also a potential choice.
Here we re-examine the optical afterglow of GRB 030329 numerically in light of
the three models. In the density-jump model, no obvious rebrightening can be
produced at the jump moment. Additionally, after the density jump, the
predicted flux density decreases rapidly to a level that is significantly below
observations. A simple density-jump model thus can be excluded. In the
two-component jet model, although the observed late afterglow (after 1.6 days)
can potentially be explained as emission from the wide-component, the emergence
of this emission actually is too slow and it does not manifest as a
rebrightening as previously expected. The energy-injection model seems to be
the most preferred choice. By engaging a sequence of energy-injection events,
it provides an acceptable fit to the rebrightening at $\sim 1.6$ d, as well as
the whole observed light curve that extends to $\sim 80$ d. Further studies on
these multiple energy-injection processes may provide a valuable insight into
the nature of the central engines of gamma-ray bursts.

with a mean metallicity corresponding to Z=0.006. These values may however be

instead, particularly useful for detecting variations in the mean metallicity

We discuss the ground-state finite-size scaling properties of three different
quantities--the Binder moment ratio, the spin stiffness, and the
long-wavelength magnetic susceptibility--which we use to extract the critical
value of the coupling ratio g=J_perp/J. The individual estimates of g_c are
consistent provided that subleading finite-size corrections are properly taken
into account. In the case of the complete bilayer, the Binder ratio leads to
the most precise estimate of the critical coupling, although the subleading
finite-size corrections to the stiffness are considerably smaller. For the
incomplete bilayer, the subleading corrections to the stiffness are extremely
small, and this quantity then gives the best estimate of the critical point.
Contrary to predictions, we do not find a universal prefactor of the 1/L spin
stiffness scaling at the critical point, whereas the Binder ratio is consistent
with a universal value. Our results for the critical coupling ratios are
g_c=2.52181(3) (full bilayer) and g_c=1.38882(2) (incomplete bilayer), which

magnetic nanostructures on surfaces. We focus on magnetic 3d impurity
nanoclusters, sitting as adatoms on or in the first surface layer on Ni(001),
and investigate the size and orientation of the local moments and moreover the
stabilization of non-collinear magnetic solutions. While clusters of Fe, Co, Ni
atoms are magnetically collinear, non-collinear magnetic coupling is expected
for Cr and Mn clusters on surfaces of elemental ferromagnets. The origin of
frustration is the competition of the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling among
the Cr or Mn atoms with the antiferromagnetic (for Cr) or ferromagnetic (for
Mn) exchange coupling between the impurities and the substrate. We find that Cr
and Mn first-neighbouring dimers and a Mn trimer on Ni(001) show non-collinear
behavior nearly degenerate with the most stable collinear configuration.
Increasing the distance between the dimer atoms leads to a collinear behavior,
similar to the one of the single impurities. Finally, we compare some of the
non-collinear {\it ab-initio} results to those obtained within a classical
Heisenberg model, where the exchange constants are fitted to total energies of
the collinear states; the agreement is surprisingly good.

shown to dramatically increase the throughput of wireless communication

Here, an approach is presented that provides analytic expressions not only for

mutual information for zero-mean Gaussian (multiple-input multiple-output) MIMO
channels with the most general multipath covariance matrices when the channel
is known at the receiver. These channels include multi-tap delay paths, as well

are formally valid for large antenna numbers, in which limit it is shown that
all higher cumulant moments of the distribution, other than the first two scale

stories about community activities, and news from various user communities that
include teachers, students, scholars, and developers. Long-standing library
traditions of service, preservation, democratization of knowledge, rich
discourse, equal access, and fair use are evident in library communications
models that both pull in and push out contextual information from multiple
sources integrated with editorial production processes. This paper argues that
a dynamic narrative flow [1] is enabled by effective management of complex
content and communications in a decentralized web-based education digital
library making publishing objects such as aggregations of resources, or
selected parts of objects [4] accessible through a Content and Communications
System. Providing services that encourage patrons to reuse, reflect out, and
contribute resources back [5] to the Library increases the reach and impact of
the National Science Digital Library (NSDL). This system is a model for
distributed content development and effective communications for education
digital libraries in general.

multiplexing (OFDM) system known as Multiband OFDM for high-rate wireless
personal area networks (WPANs) based on ultra-wideband (UWB) transmission.
Besides considering the standard, we also propose and study system performance
enhancements through the application of Turbo and Repeat-Accumulate (RA) codes,
as well as OFDM bit-loading. Our methodology consists of (a) a study of the
channel model developed under IEEE 802.15 for UWB from a frequency-domain
perspective suited for OFDM transmission, (b) development and quantification of
appropriate information-theoretic performance measures, (c) comparison of these
measures with simulation results for the Multiband OFDM standard proposal as
well as our proposed extensions, and (d) the consideration of the influence of
practical, imperfect channel estimation on the performance. We find that the
current Multiband OFDM standard sufficiently exploits the frequency selectivity
of the UWB channel, and that the system performs in the vicinity of the channel
cutoff rate. Turbo codes and a reduced-complexity clustered bit-loading
algorithm improve the system power efficiency by over 6 dB at a data rate of
480 Mbps.

in observing technology and data modeling, which led to the current accuracy of
post-fit residuals of ~2 cm. Today LLR is a primary technique to study the
dynamics of the Earth-Moon system and is especially important for gravitational
physics, geodesy and studies of the lunar interior. LLR is used to perform
high-accuracy tests of the equivalence principle, to search for a
time-variation in the gravitational constant, and to test predictions of
various alternative theories of gravity. On the geodesy front, LLR contributes
to the determination of Earth orientation parameters, such as nutation,
precession (including relativistic precession), polar motion, and UT1, i.e.
especially to the long-term variation of these effects. LLR contributes to the
realization of both the terrestrial and selenocentric reference frames. The
realization of a dynamically defined inertial reference frame, in contrast to
the kinematically realized frame of VLBI, offers new possibilities for mutual
cross-checking and confirmation. Finally, LLR also investigates the processes
related to the Moon's interior dynamics. Here, we review the LLR technique
focusing on its impact on relativity and give an outlook to further
applications, e.g. in geodesy. We present results of our dedicated studies to

Wheeler-DeWitt equation which is free of UV problems. However, ambiguities
associated to the intermediate regularization procedure lead to an apparently
infinite set of possible theories. The absence of an UV problem is intimately
linked with the ambiguities arising in the quantum theory. Among these
ambiguities there is the one associated to the SU(2) unitary rep. used in the
diffeomorphism covariant pointsplitting regularization of nonlinear funct. of
the connection. This ambiguity is labelled by a halfinteger m and, here, it is
referred to as the m-ambiguity. The aim of this paper is to investigate the
important implications of this ambiguity./ We first study 2+1 gravity quantized
in canonical LQG. Only when the regularization of the quantum constraints is
performed in terms of the fundamental rep. of the gauge group one obtains the
usual TQFT. In all other cases unphysical local degrees of freedom arise at the
level of the regulated theory that conspire against the existence of the
continuum limit. This shows that there is a clear cut choice in the
quantization of the constraints in 2+1 LQG./ We then analyze the effects of the
ambiguity in 3+1 gravity exhibiting the existence of spurious solutions for
higher unit. rep. quantizations of the Hamiltonian constraint. Although the
analysis is not complete in D=3+1--due to the difficulties associated to the
definition of the physical inner product--it provides evidence supporting the
definitions quantum dynamics of loop quantum gravity in terms of the
fundamental representation of the gauge group as the only consistent
possibilities. If the gauge group is SO(3) we find physical solutions
associated to spin-two local excitations.

fermions dynamically by replacing the exact overlap operator by an approximate
version. This approximation is used either as only the guidance Hamiltonian,
keeping the exact overlap operator as the accept/reject Hamiltonian or for
both, the guidance and accept/reject Hamiltonian in the Hybrid Monte Carlo
algorithm. In the latter case we test whether the approximation error can be
corrected for by computing the determinant ratio of the exact and the
approximate overlap operators stochastically.

  typo in Tab. III corrected",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Lorentz Invariance (LI) is the founding postulate of Einstein's 1905 theory
of relativity, and therefore at the heart of all accepted theories of physics.
It characterizes the invariance of the laws of physics in inertial frames under
changes of velocity or orientation. This central role, and indications from
unification theories hinting toward a possible LI violation, have motivated
tremendous experimental efforts to test LI. A comprehensive theoretical
framework to describe violations of LI has been developed over the last decade:
the Lorentz violating Standard Model Extension (SME). It allows a
characterization of LI violations in all fields of present day physics using a
large (but finite) set of parameters which are all zero when LI is satisfied.
All classical tests (e.g. Michelson-Morley or Kennedy-Thorndike experiments)
can be analyzed in the SME, but it also allows the conception of new types of
experiments, not thought of previously. We have carried out such a conceptually
new LI test, by comparing particular atomic transitions (particular
orientations of the involved nuclear spins) in the $^{133}$Cs atom using a cold
atomic fountain clock. This allows us to test LI in a previously largely
unexplored region of the SME parameter space, corresponding to first
measurements of four proton parameters and an improvement by 11 and 12 orders
of magnitude on the determination of four others. In spite of the attained
accuracies, and of having extended the search into a new region of the SME, we
still find no indication of LI violation.

This theory is a holomorphic complex matrix quantum mechanics. When the value
of the chemical potential is not far below the mass of the scalars, the states
of the effective theory consist only of the half-BPS states. The theory is
solved by the operator method and by utilizing the lowest Landau level
projection prescription for the value of the chemical potential less than or
equal to the mass of the scalars. When the chemical potential is below the
mass, we find that the degeneracy of the lowest Landau level is lifted and the
energies of the states are computed. The one-loop correction to the effective
potential is computed for the commuting fields and treated as a perturbation to
the tree level quantum mechanics. We find that the perturbation term has
non-vanishing matrix elements that mix the states with the same R-charge.

  This is a space of smooth maps from a finite graph to M, which, when

Morse) function on M. Using the model of Gromov-Witten theory, with this moduli
space replacing the space of stable holomorphic curves in a symplectic
manifold, we obtain invariants, which are (co)homology operations in M. The
invariants obtained in this setting are classical cohomology operations such as
cup product, Steenrod squares, and Stiefel-Whitney classes. We show that these
operations satisfy invariance and gluing properties that fit together to give
the structure of a topological quantum field theory. By considering equivariant
operations with respect to the action of the automorphism group of the graph,
the field theory has more structure. It is analogous to a homological conformal
field theory. In particular we show that classical relations such as the Adem
relations and Cartan formulae are consequences of these field theoretic
properties.
  These operations are defined and studied using two different methods. First,
we use algebraic topological techniques to define appropriate virtual
fundamental classes of these moduli spaces. This allows us to define the
operations via the corresponding intersection numbers of the moduli space.
Secondly, we use geometric and analytic techniques to study the smoothness and
compactness properties of these moduli spaces. This will allow us to define
these operations on the level of Morse-Smale chain complexes, by appropriately
counting metric-graph-flows with particular boundary conditions.

strong* closures of the unitary orbit of a normal operator in a von Neumann

  We relate this to several known results and derive some consequences, of
which we list a few here. Exactly when the ambient von Neumann algebra is a
direct sum of sigma-finite algebras, any two normal operators have the same
norm-closed unitary orbit if and only if they have the same strong*-closed
unitary orbit if and only if they have the same strong-closed unitary orbit.
But these three closures generally differ from each other and from the unclosed
unitary orbit, and we characterize when equality holds between any two of these
four sets. We also show that in a properly infinite von Neumann algebra, the
strong-closed unitary orbit of any operator, not necessarily normal, meets the
center in the (non-void) left essential central spectrum of Halpern. One
corollary is a ""type III Weyl-von Neumann-Berg theorem"" involving containment
of essential central spectra.

of a team's won-loss percentage is Bill James' Pythagorean Formula RSobs^c /
(RSobs^c + RAobs^c), where RSobs (resp. RAobs) is the observed average number
of runs scored (allowed) per game and c is a constant for the league; for
baseball the best agreement is when c is about 1.82. We provide a theoretical
justification for this formula and value of c by modelling the number of runs
scored and allowed in baseball games as independent random variables drawn from
Weibull distributions with the same b and c but different a; the probability
density f(x;a,b,c) is 0 for x < b and is (c/a) ((x-b)/a)^{c-1}
exp(-((x-b)/a)^c) otherwise. This model leads to a predicted won-loss
percentage of (RS-b)^c / ((RS-b)^c + (RA-b)^c); here RS (resp. RA) is the mean
of the random variable corresponding to runs scored (allowed), and RS - b
(resp. RA - b) is an estimator of RSobs (resp. RAobs). An analysis of the 14
American League teams from the 2004 baseball season shows that (1) given that
the runs scored and allowed in a game cannot be equal, the runs scored and
allowed are statistically independent; (2) the best fit Weibull parameters
attained from a least squares or a maximum likelihood analysis give good fits;
least squares gives a mean value of c of 1.79 with a standard deviation of .09,
and maximum likelihood gives a mean value of c of 1.74 with a standard
deviation of .06, which agree beautifully with the observed best value of 1.82

vortex-streak interactions, direct numerical simulations for a nearly
homogeneous shear flow and experimental data for a turbulent boundary layer. A
driving of streamwise streaks by streamwise vortices gives rise to a temporal
asymmetry in the short time correlation. Close to the wall or the bounding
surface in the free-slip situations, this asymmetry is identified. Further away
from the boundaries the asymmetry becomes weaker and changes character,
indicating the prevalence of other processes. The systematic variation of the
asymmetry measure may be used as a complementary indicator to separate
different layers in turbulent shear flows. The location of the extrema at

made of mass, energy, and linear and angular momentum conservation to specify
the equations of motion. Also used extensively are insights gleaned from a
convective variational action principle, key being the distinction between each
velocity and its canonically conjugate momentum. Dissipation is incorporated to
second order in the ``thermodynamic forces'' via the approach pioneered by
Onsager. An immediate goal of the investigation is to understand better the
number, and form, of independent dissipation terms required for a consistent
set of equations of motion in the multi-fluid context. A significant, but
seemingly innocuous detail, is that one must be careful to isolate ``forces''
that can be written as total gradients, otherwise errors can be made in
relating the net internal force to the net externally applied force. Our
long-range aim is to provide a formalism that can be used to model dynamical
multi-fluid systems both perturbatively and via fully nonlinear 3D numerical
evolutions. To elucidate the formalism we consider the standard model for a
heat-conducting, superfluid neutron star, which is believed to be dominated by
superfluid neutrons, superconducting protons, and a highly degenerate,
ultra-relativistic gas of normal fluid electrons. We determine that in this

quasispecies formalism. We assume that the genomes of the replicating organisms
are two-chromosomed and diploid, and that the fitness is determined by the
number of chromosomes that are identical to a given master sequence. We also
assume that there is a cost to sexual replication, given by a characteristic
time $ \tau_{seek} $ during which haploid cells seek out a mate with which to
recombine. If the mating strategy is such that only viable haploids can mate,
then when $ \tau_{seek} = 0 $, it is possible to show that sexual replication
will always outcompete asexual replication. However, as $ \tau_{seek} $
increases, sexual replication only becomes advantageous at progressively higher
mutation rates. Once the time cost for sex reaches a critical threshold, the
selective advantage for sexual replication disappears entirely. The results of
this paper suggest that sexual replication is not advantageous in small
populations per se, but rather in populations with low replication rates. In
this regime, the cost for sex is sufficiently low that the selective advantage
obtained through recombination leads to the dominance of the strategy. In fact,
at a given replication rate and for a fixed environment volume, sexual
replication is selected for in high populations because of the reduced time
spent finding a reproductive partner.

we can tolerate and still quantum-compute to arbitrary accuracy. Although noise
thresholds are frequently estimated for the Steane seven-qubit, distance-three
quantum code, there has been no proof that a constant threshold even exists for
distance-three codes. We prove the existence of a constant threshold. The
proven threshold is well below estimates, based on simulations and analytic
models, of the true threshold, but at least it is now known to be positive.

an initial two-qubit entangled state, under the action of a reservoir. We show
that it is possible to detect disentanglement, for experimentally realizable
examples of decaying systems, through the measurement of a single observable,
which is invariant throughout the decay. The systems under consideration may
lead to either finite-time or asymptotic disentanglement. A general
prescription for measuring this observable, which yields an operational meaning
to entanglement measures, is proposed, and exemplified for cavity quantum
electrodynamics and trapped ions.

all the entries of k matrices, that is, we can query the oracle an (i,j) entry
of the l-th matrix. The goal is to test if each pair of k matrices commute with
each other or not with as few queries to the oracle as possible. In order to
solve this problem, we use a theorem of Mario Szegedy (quant-ph/0401053) that
relates a hitting time of a classical random walk to that of a quantum walk. We
also take a look at another method of quantum walk by Andris Ambainis
(quant-ph/0311001). We apply both walks into triangle finding problem
(quant-ph/0310134) and matrix verification problem (quant-ph/0409035) to
compare the powers of the two different walks. We also present Ambainis's
method of lower bounding technique (quant-ph/0002066) to obtain a lower bound
for this problem. It turns out Szegedy's algorithm can be generalized to solve
similar problems. Therefore we use Szegedy's theorem to analyze the problem of
matrix set commutativity. We give an O(k^{4/5}n^{9/5}) algorithm as well as a
lower bound of Omega(k^{1/2}n). We generalize the technique used in coming up
with the upper bound to solve a broader range of similar problems. This is
probably the first problem to be studied on the quantum query complexity using
quantum walks that involves more than one parameter, here, k and n.

calculate the concurrence, negativity, and von Neumann entropy. The
entanglement of the two Kondo impurities is shown to be determined by two
competing many-body effects, the Kondo effect and the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, $I$. Due to the
spin-rotational invariance of the ground state, the concurrence and negativity
are uniquely determined by the spin-spin correlation between the impurities. It
is found that there exists a critical minimum value of the antiferromagnetic
correlation between the impurity spins which is necessary for entanglement of
the two impurity spins. The critical value is discussed in relation with the
unstable fixed point in the two impurity Kondo problem. Specifically, at the
fixed point there is no entanglement between the impurity spins. Entanglement
will only be created (and quantum information processing (QIP) be possible) if
the RKKY interaction exchange energy, $I$, is at least several times larger
than the Kondo temperature, $T_K$. Quantitative criteria for QIP are given in
terms of the impurity spin-spin correlation.
