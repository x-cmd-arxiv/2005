included in the third data release (DR3) of the SDSS. We measure radial
velocities and, based on a model-atmosphere analysis, derive estimates ofthe
atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and [Fe/H]) for
each star. Stellar evolution models are then used to estimate distances. The
SDSS sample covers a range in stellar brightness of 14 < V < 22, and comprises
large numbers of F- and G-type stars from the thick-disk and halo populations
(up to 100 kpc from the galactic plane), therefore including some of the oldest
stars in the Milky Way. In agreement with previous results from the literature,
we find that halo stars exhibit a broad range of iron abundances, with a peak
at [Fe/H] ~ -1.4. This population exhibits essentially no galactic rotation.
Thick-disk G-dwarf stars at distances from the galactic plane in the range
1<|z|<3 kpc show a much more compact metallicity distribution, with a maximum
at [Fe/H] ~ -0.7, and a median galactic rotation velocity at that metallicity
of 157 +/- 4 km/s (a lag relative to the thin disk of 63 km/s). A comparison of
color indices and metal abundances with isochrones indicates that no
significant star formation has taken place in the halo in the last ~ 11 Gyr,
but there are thick-disk stars which are at least 2 Gyr younger. We find the
metallicities of thick-disk stars to be nearly independent of galactocentric
distance between 5 and 14 kpc, in contrast with the marked gradients found in
the literature for the thin disk. No vertical metallicity gradient is apparent
for the thick disk, but we detect a gradient inits rotational velocity of -16
+/- 4 km/s/kpc between 1 and 3 kpc from the plane.

high-resolution SPH simulations, we follow the black hole dynamics in the early
phase when gas-dynamical friction acts on the black holes individually, and
continue our simulation until they form a close binary. We find that in the
early sinking the black holes lose memory of their initial orbital eccentricity
if they co-rotate with the gaseous disc, forming a binary with a low
eccentricity, consistent with zero within our numerical resolution limit. The
cause of circularization resides in the rotation present in the gaseous
background where dynamical friction operates. Circularization may hinder
gravitational waves from taking over and leading the binary to coalescence. In
the case of counter-rotating orbits the initial eccentricity does not decrease,
and the black holes may bind forming an eccentric binary. When dynamical
friction has subsided, for equal mass black holes and regardless their initial
eccentricity, angular momentum loss, driven by the gravitational torque exerted
on the binary by surrounding gas, is nevertheless observable down to the
smallest scale probed. In the case of unequal masses, dynamical friction
remains efficient down to our resolution limit, and there is no sign of
formation of any ellipsoidal gas distribution that may further harden the
binary. During inspiral, gravitational capture of gas by the black holes occurs
mainly along circular orbits: eccentric orbits imply high relative velocities
and weak gravitational focusing. Thus, AGN activity may be excited during the
black hole pairing process and double active nuclei may form when
circularization is completed, on distance-scales of tens of pcs.

radio burst observed on June 13 is characterized by the presence of multitudes
of short duration ($\Delta t \sim$30 ms), high brightness temperature
($T_{b}>10^{14}$K), highly circularly polarized, fast-drift radio sub-bursts,
with median bandwidths $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim$5%. The inverse drift rates are
small, and have a symmetric distribution (both positive and negative frequency
drifts) with a Gaussian FWHM inverse drift rate of 4.5$\times10^{-4}$ s/MHz.
The fast-drift sub-bursts occur at a mean rate of 13 s$^{-1}$ and show no

highly reminiscent of solar decimetric spike bursts. We suggest the emission is
due to fundamental plasma radiation. A second highly circularly polarized radio
burst, recorded June 14, has markedly different properties: a smoothly varying
intensity profile characterized by a slow drift in frequency with time (-52 MHz
s$^{-1}$). Under the assumption that the source is due to a disturbance
propagating through the low corona, a source size of 0.1--1 R$_{\star}$ is

significantly the total filter noise. In this light, we find that a 3-band

Only about half the systems with a peak tau(CIV) above 0.4 in the 1548 Angstrom

velocity widths large enough to originate in this way, and very few of the

value of tau(CIV) also separates systems that could be ionized by galaxy-like
spectra from those in which the ionization is clearly AGN-dominated. Together
the results are consistent with a picture in which almost all the lower column
density, and at least half the higher column density, systems lie in the more

produced directly by the outflows and possibly be ionized by their parent

Asteroids to an epoch correspondent to a close approach with a Solar System
planet or natural satellite, it is possible to estimate the probability of a
partial or total eclipse.
  The direct observation of an eclipse can provide data useful to improve the
asteroid orbit, especially for dim asteroids typically observed only for a few
days. We propose two different methods: the first, based on the inclusion of
the apparent magnitude residuals into the orbit's least squares minimization
process, capable of improving the asteroid's nominal orbit and the related
covariance matrix; the second, based on weighting different Virtual Asteroids
in relation to their apparent magnitude during the eclipse, useful for recovery
purposes.

that Fe from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) does not contribute to the stellar
abundances in the dSph galaxies where the member stars exhibit low alpha/Fe
ratios except for the most massive dSph galaxy, the Sagitarrius. The more
massive dwarf (irregular) galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, also have an SNe

increasing [Fe/H]. In addition, the lack of massive stars in the dSph galaxies
does not satisfactorily account for the low-alpha signature. Considering the
assemblage of deficient elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Zn), all of which are

investigated in detail and, at this stage, the reliability of the diagnostic
power of the fine structure transitions of O I and C II has been examined.
Several issues, such as the extremely small intensity ratios of the oxygen 63
micron to 145 micron lines, are still awaiting an explanation. It is
demonstrated that, in interstellar cloud conditions, the 145 micron line is
prone to masing, but that this effect is likely an insufficient cause of the
line ratio anomaly observed from cold dark clouds. Very optically thick
emission could in principle also account for this, but would need similar,
prohibitively high column densities and must therefore be abondoned as a viable
explanation. One is left with [O I] 63 micron self absorption by cold and
tenuous foreground gas, as has been advocated for distant luminous sources.
Recent observations with the submillimeter observatory Odin support this
scenario also in the case of nearby dark molecular clouds. On the basis of this
large statistical material we are led to conclude that in star forming regions,
the [O I] and [C II] lines generally have only limited diagnostic value.

for stellar collisions, a 200 Myr old starburst appears to be the most
plausible origin of the blue nucleus. In stellar population, size, and velocity
dispersion, the blue nucleus is so different from P1 and P2 that we call it P3.

the support for Tremaine s eccentric disk model. The kinematics of P3 is
consistent with a circular stellar disk in Keplerian rotation around a

shear leads to non-trivial modification of surface gravity wave modes

in regions of the magnetic star where the Frenet torsion is constant it induces
an oscillation in the vortex filaments. By solving the magnetar equilibrium
equation we shown the this behaviour also appears in the magnetic field. The
first derivative of the gravitational potential with respect to the arc lenght
of the vortex filament is shown to coincide with the Hasimoto soliton
transformation of the Schroedinger equation for the constant torsion.

is produced in a dense disk surrounding the binary system; during the low
excitation phase, which occurs close to periastron, the number of ionizing
photons decreases, producing the dip in the radio emission. On the other hand,
due to the large eccentricity, the density of the shock region at periastron is
very high and the plasma is optically thick for free-free radiation at 7 mm,
explaining the sharp peak that was observed at this frequency and lasted for
about 10 days. From the shape and duration of the peak we were able to
determine the orbital parameters of the binary system, independently of the
stellar parameters, such as mass loss rates, wind velocities or temperature at

of the IG stars and group galaxies are, at r>~30 kpc, significantly more
radially anisotropic for FGs than for nonFGs. So a characteristic of FG
formation, apart from formation time (D'Onghia et al.), may be the ""initial""
velocity distribution of the group galaxies. For FGs one can dynamically infer
the (dark matter dominated) mass distribution of the groups all the way to
r_vir, from the kinematics of the IG stars or group galaxies. For the nonFGs
this method overestimates the group mass at r>~200 kpc, by up to a factor of
two at r_vir. This is interpreted as FGs being, in general, more relaxed than
nonFGs. Finally, FGs of the above M_vir should host ~500 planetary nebulae at
projected distances between 100 and 1000 kpc from the first ranked galaxy. All
results appear consistent with the FG formation scenario of D'Onghia et al.

solution of the model is highly degenerate and is spanned by five S=0 states,
nine S=1 states, five S=2 states and one S=3 state. The orbital occupancies in
all these states correspond to six $Cu(II)$ ions and one diamagnetic $Mo(IV)$

at nearly the same excitation energy of 2.993 eV for the physically reasonable
parameter values. The degeneracy of the CT states is largest in the S=3 sector
and so is the transition dipole moment from the ground state to these excited

intense absorption in the S=3 sector. The life-time of the S=3 excited states
is also expected to be the largest as the number of states below that energy is
very sparse in this spin sector when compared to other spin sectors. These twin

Both the thermal expansion and compressibility are very anisotropic, with the
largest effects along the c axis, as would be expected for a layered material
with weak hydrogen bonding nominally along the c axis. Near room temperature,
the anisotropies of the thermal expansion and compressibility of the hexagonal
crystal structure are nearly the same [(Dc/c)/(Da/a)=3-4], with a 100 C change
in temperature being roughly equivalent to 0.2 GPa pressure. This would imply
that changes in atom position parameters are also the same, but this is not the
case. While the effects of temperature on the atom positions are essentially
what one might expect, the effects of pressure are surprising. With increasing
pressure, the thickness of the CoO2 layer increases, due to the combined
effects of an increasing Co-O bond length and changes in the O-Co-O angles of
the CoO6 octahedra. We conclude that this unusual effect results from
pressure-induced strengthening of the hydrogen bonding between the Nax(D2O)4x
layers and the CoO2 layers. The strengthening of these hydrogen bonds requires
that charge be moved from the somewhere else in the structure; hence, there is
a pressure induced charge redistribution that weakens (lengthens) the Co-O
bonds and changes the electronic structure of the superconducting CoO2 layers.

a convenient base with respect to which the lattice potential becomes
time-dependent, inducing transitions between the Landau-Floquet levels. Based
on this formalism, we provide a Kubo-like formula that takes into account the
oscillatory Floquet structure of the problem. The total conductivity exhibits
strong oscillations, determined by $\epsilon = \omega / \omega_c$ with $\omega$

which maximizes the network efficiency while keeping the cost of the network
(that is the average connectivity) constant. With a global optimization method,
memory tabu search (MTS), we get the optimal network structure with the
approximately best efficiency. We analyze the statistical characters of the
network and find that a network with a small quantity of hub nodes, high degree
of clustering may be much more resilient to perturbations than a random network
and the optimal network is one kind of highly heterogeneous networks. The
results strongly suggest that networks with higher efficiency are more robust
to random failures. In addition, we propose a simple model to describe the
statistical properties of the optimal network and investigate the
synchronizability of this model.

semantics. A subset of activity diagram constructs relevant for business
process modeling is considered. The semantics definition is based on the
original token flow methodology, but a more constructive approach is used. The
Activity Diagram Virtual machine is defined by means of a metamodel, with
operations defined by a mix of pseudocode and OCL pre- and postconditions. A
formal procedure is described which builds the virtual machine for any activity
diagram. The relatively complicated original token movement rules in control
nodes and edges are combined into paths from an action to action. A new
approach is the use of different (push and pull) engines, which move tokens
along the paths. Pull engines are used for paths containing join nodes, where
the movement of several tokens must be coordinated. The proposed virtual
machine approach makes the activity semantics definition more transparent where
the token movement can be easily traced. However, the main benefit of the
approach is the possibility to use the defined virtual machine as a basis for
UML activity diagram based workflow or simulation engine.

of $D$ to $H$} if $uv\in A(D)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H).$ For a fixed directed
or undirected graph $H$ and an input graph $D$, the problem of verifying
whether there exists a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ has been studied in a large
number of papers. We study an optimization version of this decision problem.
Our optimization problem is motivated by a real-world problem in defence
logistics and was introduced very recently by the authors and M. Tso.
  Suppose we are given a pair of digraphs $D,H$ and a positive integral cost
$c_i(u)$ for each $u\in V(D)$ and $i\in V(H)$. The cost of a homomorphism $f$
of $D$ to $H$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. Let $H$ be a fixed digraph. The
minimum cost homomorphism problem for $H$, MinHOMP($H$), is stated as follows:
For input digraph $D$ and costs $c_i(u)$ for each $u\in V(D)$ and $i\in V(H)$,
verify whether there is a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if it does exist,
find such a homomorphism of minimum cost. In our previous paper we obtained a
dichotomy classification of the time complexity of \MiP for $H$ being a
semicomplete digraph. In this paper we extend the classification to
semicomplete $k$-partite digraphs, $k\ge 3$, and obtain such a classification
for bipartite tournaments.

the context of general relativity from a back-reaction effect of
inhomogeneities in our universe, without the presence of a cosmological
constant or ``dark energy.'' We point out that our universe appears to be
described very accurately on all scales by a Newtonianly perturbed FLRW metric.
(This assertion is entirely consistent with the fact that we commonly encounter
$\delta \rho/\rho > 10^{30}$.) If the universe is accurately described by a
Newtonianly perturbed FLRW metric, then the back-reaction of inhomogeneities on
the dynamics of the universe is negligible. If not, then it is the burden of an
alternative model to account for the observed properties of our universe. We
emphasize with concrete examples that it is {\it not} adequate to attempt to
justify a model by merely showing that some spatially averaged quantities
behave the same way as in FLRW models with acceleration. A quantity
representing the ``scale factor'' may ``accelerate'' without there being any
physically observable consequences of this acceleration. It also is {\it not}
adequate to calculate the second-order stress energy tensor and show that it
has a form similar to that of a cosmological constant of the appropriate
magnitude. The second-order stress energy tensor is gauge dependent, and if it
were large, contributions of higher perturbative order could not be neglected.
We attempt to clear up the apparent confusion between the second-order stress
energy tensor arising in perturbation theory and the ``effective stress energy
tensor'' arising in the ``shortwave approximation.''

have to invoke an extraneous scalar field or a cosmological constant to account
for this acceleration. One argues that the terms containing the higher
dimensional metric coefficients produces an extra negative pressure that
apparently drives the inflation of the 4D space with an accelerating phase. It
is further found that in line with the physical requirements our model admits
of a decelerating phase in the early era along with an accelerating phase at
present.Further the models asymptotically mimic a steady state type of universe
although it starts from a big type of singularity. Correspondence to Wesson's
induced matter theory is also briefly discussed and in line with it it is
argued that the terms containing the higher dimensional metric coefficients

no fine tuning, concretely by a random Hamiltonian, we argue just from
equations of motion -- but {\em without} second law -- that entropy cannot go
first up and then down again except with the rather strict restriction
S_{large} \le S_{small 1} + S_{small 2}. Here S_{large} is the ""large"" entropy
in the middle era while S_{small 1} and S_{small 2} are the entropies at
certain times before and after the S_{large} - era respectively. From this
theorem of ""no strong maximum for the entropy"" a cyclic time S^1 model world
could have entropy at the most varying by a factor two and would not be
phenomenologically realistic. With an open ended time axis (-\infty, \infty)
={\bf R} some law behind the second law of thermodynamics is needed if we do
not obtain as the most likely happening that the entropy is maximal (i.e. the
heat death having already occurred from the start). We express such a law
behind the second law -- or unification of second law with the other ones -- by
assigning a probability weight $P$ for finding the world/the system in various
places in phase space. In such a model $P$ is almost unified with the rest as P
= exp (-2 ~S_{Im}) with S_{Im} going in as the imaginary part of the action. We
derive quite naturally the second law for practical purposes, a Big Bang with
two sided time directions and a need for a bottom in the Hamiltonian density.
Assuming the cosmological constant is a dynamical variable in the sense that it
is counted as ""initial condition"" we even solve in our model the cosmological
constant problem \underline{without} any allusion to anthropic principle.

the propagator of a single particle in 3+1-space leads to equality of the
vacuum-vacuum amplitudes for charge and mirror if the mean number of created

mass shifts of electric and scalar charges, the sources of Bose-fields with
spin 1 and 0 in 3+1-space, for the trajectories with subluminal relative
velocity $\beta_{12}$ of the ends and maximum proper acceleration $w_0$ are
expressed in terms of heat capacity (or energy) spectral densities of Bose and
Fermi massless particle gases with temperature $w_0/2\pi$ in 1+1-space. The
energy of one-dimensional proper field oscillations is partly deexcited in the
form of real quanta and partly remains in the field. As a result, the mass
shift of accelerated electric charge is nonzero and negative, while that of
scalar charge is zero. The traces of the Bogoliubov coefficients $\alpha^{B,F}$
describe the vector and scalar interactions of accelerated mirror with a
uniformly moving detector and were found in analytical form. The symmetry
predicts one and the same value $e_0=\sqrt{\hbar c}$ for electric and scalar
charges in 3+1-space. The arguments are adduced in favour of that this value

phase transition line. From a rigorous viewpoint non coinciding upper and lower
bounds on the critical line are known.
  In this paper we combine numerical computations with rigorous arguments to
get to a better understanding of the phase diagram. Our main results include:
  - Various numerical observations that suggest that the critical line lies
strictly in between the two bounds.
  - A rigorous statistical test based on concentration inequalities and
super-additivity, for determining whether a given point of the phase diagram is
in the localized phase. This is applied in particular to show that, with a very
low level of error, the lower bound does not coincide with the critical line.
  - An analysis of the precise asymptotic behavior of the partition function in
the delocalized phase, with particular attention to the effect of rare atypical
stretches in the disorder sequence and on whether or not in the delocalized
regime the polymer path has a Brownian scaling.
  - A new proof of the lower bound on the critical line. This proof relies on a
characterization of the localized regime which is more appealing for
interpreting the numerical data.

ranging from a clear definition and scientific understanding to the possible
applications in engineering and technology, including the limitations of both
concepts. Self-organizing systems with emergent properties are highly

  Burdyuzha (Springer, Dordrecht, 2006), p. 411-435",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Universal and rigorously derived concept of dynamic complexit
(physics/9806002) shows that any system of interacting components, including
society and civilisation, exists only as a process of highly inhomogeneous,
qualitative development of its complexity. Modern state of civilisation
corresponds to the end of unfolding of a big enough level of complexity. Such
exhausted, totally ""replete"" structure cannot be sustainable in principle and
shows instead increased instability, realising its inevitable replacement by a
new kind of structure with either low or much higher level of complexity
(degrading or progressive development branch, respectively). Unrestricted
sustainability can emerge only after transition to the next, superior level of
civilisation complexity, which implies qualitative and unified changes in all
aspects of life, including knowledge, production, social organisation, and
infrastructure. These changes are specified by the rigorous analysis of
underlying interaction processes. The unitary, effectively one-dimensional and
rigidly fixed kind of thinking, knowledge, and social structure at the current
level of complexity will be replaced by ""dynamically multivalued"",
intrinsically creative kind of structure at the forthcoming superior level of
development. We propose mathematically rigorous description of unreduced
civilisation complexity development, including universal criterion of progress.
One obtains thus a working basis for the causally complete, objectively exact
and reliable development science and futurology.

subdiffusion between electron and ion bunches), may account for the observed
rate enhancement. In this work, we consider the isotropic distribution function
and we propose a possible experiment for verifying the existence of a cut-off
in the generalized momentum distribution, by measuring the spectrum of the
X-rays emitted from radiative recombination reactions.

This paper deals with two computational problems associated to finding
decompositions which are optimal in an appropriate sense. In graph-theoretic
language, the problems can be recast in terms of maximal sign-consistent
subgraphs. The theoretical results include polynomial-time approximation
algorithms as well as constant-ratio inapproximability results. One of the
algorithms, which has a worst-case guarantee of 87.9 percent from optimality,
is based on the semidefinite programming relaxation approach of
Goemans-Williamson. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a Drosophila
segmentation network and an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor pathway model, and
it was found to perform close to optimally.

  The former is used to fix which is the best detection probability amplitude

the states to the final configuration. In a final step, we decompose the
