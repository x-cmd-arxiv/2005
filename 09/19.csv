classification scheme does not use galaxy colours, hence it does not bias
against young stellar populations. The 249 galaxies (i_AB<24) paint a complex
formation picture. Their stellar populations show gradients which readily rule
out a large range of ages among and within galaxies. On the other hand, there
is a decrease in the comoving number density, which suggests a strong bias when
comparing local and distant early-type galaxies. This bias can be caused either
by a significant fraction of non early-type progenitors or by a selection
effect (e.g. dust-enshrouded progenitors). The deep images of the UDF were used
to determine the structural properties of some of these galaxies. Regarding the
distribution of disky/boxy isophotes, we do not find large differences with
respect to local systems. However, some early-types with the standard features
of a red and dead galaxy reveal interesting residuals, possible signatures of

PDS because low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) exhibit two distinctive types of
PDS. At low accretion rates, the PDS is characterised by a broken power law,
with the spectral index changing from ~0 to ~1 at some frequency in the range
\~0.01--1 Hz; we refer to such PDS as Type A. At higher accretion rates, the
PDS is described by a simple power law; we call these PDS Type B. Of the 225
sources studied to date, 75 exhibit Type A variability, and are almost
certainly LMXBs, while 6 show Type B but not Type A, and are likely LMXBs. Of
these 81 candidate LMXBs, 71 are newly identified in this survey; furthermore,
they are mostly found near the centre of M31. Furthermore, most of the X-ray
population in the disc are associated with the spiral arms, making them likely
high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). In general these HMXBs do not exhibit Type A
variability, while many central X-ray sources (LMXBs) in the same luminosity

quantities derived from measured RCs with predictions of semi-analytic models
is difficult. The virial velocity V_c, which is usually calculated and used by
semi-analytic models can differ significantly from fit parameters like V_max or
V_opt inferred from RCs. We find that V_c is usually lower than typical
characteristic velocities derived from RCs. V_max alone is in general not a

Evolution galaxy count models based on the spectral synthesis models of Bruzual
& Charlot. These PLE models give an excellent fit to the our H band count data
to H<22.5 and HDF count data to H<28. However, PLE models with a Salpeter IMF
for early-type galaxies overestimate the average galaxy redshift in K<20 galaxy
redshift surveys. Models that assume a steep x=3 IMF give better agreement
data, although they do show an unobserved peak in B-H and I-H colour
distributions at faint H magnitudes corresponding to z>1 early-type galaxies.
This feature may simply reflect a larger scatter in optical-infra-red colours
than in the B-R colour of early-type galaxies at this redshift. This scatter is
obvious in optical-IR colour-colour diagrams and may be explained by on-going
star-formation in an intermediate sub-population of early-type galaxies. The
numbers of EROs detected are a factor of 2-3 lower than predicted by the
early-type models that assume the Salpeter IMF and in better agreement with
those that assume the x=3 IMF. The tight sequence of early-type galaxies also
shows a sub-class which is simultaneously redder in infrared bands and bluer in
the bluer bands than the classical, passive early-type galaxy; this sub-class
appears at relatively low redshifts and may constitute an intermediate age,

all Reynolds numbers, but may nevertheless become turbulent through nonlinear
mechanisms. However, in the last ten years, conflicting points of view have
appeared on this issue. We have revisited the problem through numerical
simulations in the shearing sheet limit. It turns out that the effect of the
Coriolis force in stabilizing the flow depends on whether the flow is cyclonic
(cooperating shear and rotation vorticities) or anticyclonic (competing shear
and rotation vorticities); keplerian flows are anticyclonic. We have obtained
the following results: i/ The Coriolis force does not quench turbulence in
subcritical flows; ii/ The resolution demand, when moving away from the
marginal stability boundary, is much more severe for anticyclonic flows than
for cyclonic ones. Presently available computer resources do not allow
numerical codes to reach the keplerian regime. iii/ The efficiency of turbulent
transport is directly correlated to the Reynolds number of transition to
turbulence $Rg$, in such a way that the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter $\alpha\sim
1/Rg$. iv/ Even the most optimistic extrapolations of our numerical data show
that subcritical turbulent transport would be too inefficient in keplerian
flows by several orders of magnitude for astrophysical purposes. v/ Our results
suggest that the data obtained for keplerian-like flows in a Taylor-Couette
settings are largely affected by secondary flows, such as Ekman circulation.

spectroscopic study of CPD - 41degr7742, deriving for the first time an orbital
solution for both components of the system. In this second paper, we focus on
the analysis of the optical light curve and on recent XMM-Newton X-ray
observations. In the optical, the system presents two eclipses, yielding an
inclination i ~ 77degr. Combining the constraints from the photometry with the
results of our previous work, we derive the absolute parameters of the system.
We confirm that the two components of CPD - 41degr7742 are main sequence stars
(O9 V + B1-1.5 V) with masses (M_1 ~ 18 Msol and M_2 ~ 10 Msol) and respective
radii (R_1 ~ 7.5 Rsol and R_2 ~ 5.4 Rsol) close to the typical values expected
for such stars. We also report an unprecedented set of X-ray observations that
almost uniformly cover the 2.44-day orbital cycle. The X-ray emission from CPD
- 41degr7742 is well described by a two-temperature thermal plasma model with
energies close to 0.6 and 1.0 keV, thus slightly harder than typical early-type
emission. The X-ray light curve shows clear signs of variability. The emission
level is higher when the primary is in front of the secondary. During the high
emission state, the system shows a drop of its X-ray emission that almost
exactly matches the optical eclipse. We interpret the main features of the
X-ray light curve as the signature of a wind-photosphere interaction, in which
the overwhelming primary O9 star wind crashes into the secondary surface.
Alternatively the light curve could result from a wind-wind interaction zone

quasar brightness fluctuation at a time of subdued microlensing activity,
between June 27 and October 12, 2003. These data were used to determine the
time delays between the arrivals of the four images. The measured delays are
-6, 35, and 2 hours for images B, C and D relative to A, respectively, so they
confirm that the long history of brightness monitoring has produced significant
detection of microlensing. However the error bars associated with the delays,
of order 2 days, are too large to discriminate between competing macro-imaging
models. Moreover, our simulations show that for the amplitude of this intrinsic
fluctuation and for photometric errors intrinsic to optical monitoring from our
1.5-m telescope or from the OGLE monitoring, a daily sampled brightness record
cannot produce reliable lags for model discrimination. We use our simulations
to devise a strategy for future delay determination with optical data.
Nevertheless, we regard these first estimates to be significant, since they are
the first direct measurements of time delays made for this system from
ground-based observations in the visual wavelengths. Our results provide the
most convincing confirmation of the gravitational-lens nature of Q2237+0305,

  correction to our implementation of the Umebayashi-Nakano reaction network",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20053678",,"astro-ph",,"  We calculate the ionisation fraction in protostellar disk models using a
number of different chemical reaction networks, including gas-phase and
gas-grain reaction schemes. The disk models we consider are conventional
alpha-disks, which include viscous heating and radiative cooling. The primary
source of ionisation is assumed to be X-ray irradiation from the central star.
We consider a number of gas-phase chemical networks. In general we find that
the simple models predict higher fractional ionisation levels and more
extensive active zones than the more complex models. When heavy metal atoms are
included the simple models predict that the disk is magnetically active
throughout. The complex models predict that extensive regions of the disk
remain magnetically uncoupled even with a fractional abundance of magnesium of
10(-8). The addition of submicron sized grains with a concentration of 10(-12)
causes the size of the dead zone to increase dramatically for all kinetic
models considered. We find that the simple and complex gas-grain reaction
schemes agree on the size and structure of the resulting dead zone. We examine
the effects of depleting the concentration of small grains as a crude means of
modeling the growth of grains during planet formation. We find that a depletion
factor of 10(-4) causes the gas-grain chemistry to converge to the gas-phase
chemistry when heavy metals are absent. 10(-8) is required when magnesium is
included. This suggests that efficient grain growth and settling will be
required in protoplanetary disks, before a substantial fraction of the disk
mass in the planet forming zone between 1 - 10 AU becomes magnetically active
and turbulent.

characterized by small proper sizes (R_50 < 2 kpc) in the 4350A rest-frame, low
masses (5x10^9 M_sun), and a wide range of luminosities and surface
brightnesses. The masses, sizes and volume densities of these objects appear to
change very little up to a redshift of z=1.5. On the other hand, their surface
brightness decreases significantly from z=1.5 to z=0 while their mass-to-light
ratio increases two-folds. This could be a sign that most of low redshift
eGRAPES have an older stellar population than high redshift eGRAPES and hence
that most eGRAPES formed at higher redshifts. The average volume density of
eGRAPES is (1.8 \pm 0.3)x10^{-3} Mpc^{-3} between 0.3 < z < 1.5. Many eGRAPES
would formally have been classified as Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs)

and high surface brightness, while the remainder of the sample discussed in

first-principles density functional calculations. We find the most appropriate
description of these compounds from the viewpoint of electronic structures is
one of a \textit{YZ} zinc blende lattice stuffed by the \textit{X} ion. Simple
valence rules are obeyed for bonding in the 8-electron compound. For example,
LiMgN can be written Li$^+$ + (MgN)$^-$, and (MgN)$^-$, which is isoelectronic
with (SiSi), forms a zinc blende lattice. The 18-electron compounds can
similarly be considered as obeying valence rules. A semiconductor such as
TiCoSb can be written Ti$^{4+}$ + (CoSb)$^{4-}$; the latter unit is
isoelectronic and isostructural with zinc-blende GaSb. For both the 8- and
18-electron compounds, when \textit{X} is fixed as some electropositive cation,
the computed band gap varies approximately as the difference in Pauling
electronegativities of \textit{Y} and \textit{Z}. What is particularly exciting

extended to the very important \textit{magnetic} half-Heusler phases; we

disordered systems, thermodynamic observables are not self-averaging at
critical points when the disorder is relevant in the Harris criterion sense.
This lack of self-averageness at criticality is directly related to the
distribution of pseudo-critical temperatures $T_c(i,L)$ over the ensemble of
samples $(i)$ of size $L$. In this paper, we apply this analysis to disordered
Poland-Scheraga models with different loop exponents $c$,corresponding to
marginal and relevant disorder. In all cases, we numerically obtain a Gaussian
histogram of pseudo-critical temperatures $T_c(i,L)$ with mean $T_c^{av}(L)$
and width $\Delta T_c(L)$. For the marginal case $c=1.5$ corresponding to
two-dimensional wetting, both the width $\Delta T_c(L)$ and the shift
$[T_c(\infty)-T_c^{av}(L)]$ decay as $L^{-1/2}$, so the exponent is unchanged
($\nu_{random}=2=\nu_{pure}$) but disorder is relevant and leads to non
self-averaging at criticality. For relevant disorder $c=1.75$, the width
$\Delta T_c(L)$ and the shift $[T_c(\infty)-T_c^{av}(L)]$ decay with the same
new exponent $L^{-1/\nu_{random}}$ (where $\nu_{random} \sim 2.7 > 2 >
\nu_{pure}$) and there is again no self-averaging at criticality. Finally for
the value $c=2.15$, of interest in the context of DNA denaturation, the
transition is first-order in the pure case. In the presence of disorder, the
width $\Delta T_c(L) \sim L^{-1/2}$ dominates over the shift
$[T_c(\infty)-T_c^{av}(L)] \sim L^{-1}$, i.e. there are two correlation length
exponents $\nu=2$ and $\tilde \nu=1$ that govern respectively the
averaged/typical loop distribution.

driving into a granular gas, in the infinite time limit. Starting from a

function of the cumulants mu(lambda) which appears as a generalization of the
inelastic Boltzmann equation and has a clear physical interpretation.
Reasonable assumptions are used to obtain mu(lambda) in a closed analytical
form. A Legendre transform is sufficient to get the large deviation function
pi(w). Our main result, apart from an estimate of all the cumulants of W(t) at
large times t, is that pi(w) has no negative branch. This immediately results
in the failure of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Relation (GCFR), that in
previous studies had been suggested to be valid for injected power in driven
granular gases. We also present numerical results, in order to discuss the
finite time behavior of the fluctuations of W(t). We discover that their
probability density function converges extremely slowly to its asymptotic
scaling form: the third cumulant saturates after a characteristic time larger
than 50 mean free times and the higher order cumulants evolve even slower. The
asymptotic value is in good agreement with our theory. Remarkably, a numerical
check of the GCFR is feasible only at small times, since negative events
disappear at larger times. At such small times this check leads to the
misleading conclusion that GCFR is satisfied for pi(w). We offer an explanation
for this remarkable apparent verification. In the inelastic Maxwell model,
where a better statistics can be achieved, we are able to numerically observe
the failure of GCFR.

planes passing through every vertex. A vertex-unfolding permits faces in the
net to be connected at single vertices, not necessarily along edges. We show
that any orthogonal polyhedron of genus zero has a grid vertex-unfolding.
(There are orthogonal polyhedra that cannot be vertex-unfolded, so some type of
""gridding"" of the faces is necessary.) For any orthogonal polyhedron P with n
vertices, we describe an algorithm that vertex-unfolds P in O(n^2) time.
Enroute to explaining this algorithm, we present a simpler vertex-unfolding
algorithm that requires a 3 x 1 refinement of the vertex grid.

assumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong
independence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that
relaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve
the classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an
optimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring
measure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time
optimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have
examined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a
Naive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN
structure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and
present a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to
MDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the
augmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a
relaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search
methods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets. The
authors, however, evaluate the learned structure only in terms of observed
misclassification error and not against a scoring metric, such as MDL. In this
paper, we present a simple, polynomial time greedy algorithm for learning an
optimal Augmented Bayes Network with respect to MDL score.

condition for the existence of two-parameter $p, q$-variation path integrals.
Our condition of locally bounded $p,q$-variation is more natural and easy to
verify than those of Young. This result can be easily generalized to
multi-parameter case. The second result is to define the integral of local time
$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_0^t g(s,x)d_{s,x}L_s(x)$ pathwise and then give
generalized It$\hat {\rm o}$'s formula when $\nabla^-f(s,x)$ is only of bounded
$p,q$-variation in $(s,x)$. In the case that $g(s,x)=\nabla^-f(s,x)$ is of
locally bounded variation in $(s,x)$, the integral
$\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_0^t \nabla^-f(s,x)d_{s,x}L_s(x)$ is the
Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and was used in Elworthy, Truman and Zhao
\cite{Zhao}. When $g(s,x)=\nabla^-f(s,x)$ is of only locally $p, q$-variation,
where $p\geq 1$,$q\geq 1$, and $2q+1>2pq$, the integral is a two-parameter
Young integral of $p,q$-variation rather than a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. In
the special case that $f(s,x)=f(x)$ is independent of $s$, we give a new
condition for Meyer's formula and $\int_{-\infty}^\infty L_t(x)d_x\nabla^-f(x)$
is defined pathwise as a Young integral. For this we prove the local time
$L_t(x)$ is of $p$-variation in $x$ for each $t\geq 0$, for each $p>2$ almost
surely ($p$-variation in the sense of Lyons and Young, i.e. $\sup\limits_{E: \

p+p collisions at RHIC and LHC energy. Leading order pQCD models require a
K-factor. At RHIC energy, $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV, we fix K such that the model
reproduces the integrated charm yield, $dN^{c\bar{c}}/dy$, estimated by the
STAR and the PHENIX collaboration in p+p collisions. The model then explains
the STAR data on the transverse momentum distribution of open charm mesons
$(D^0)$ and decay electrons in p+p collisions. The p+p predictions, scaled by
the number of binary collisions, also explain the electron spectra in STAR p+d
collisions and PHENIX Au+Au collisions in different centrality bins. Assuming
that at LHC energy K-factor is of the order of unity, we have used the model to
predict the transverse momentum distribution of $D$ and $B$ mesons and also of
electrons from semileptonic decay of $D\to e$ and $B\to e$, in p+p collisions
at LHC energy, $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV.

to a pure cosmological constant cosmology due to changes in the slope of a
graph of the resulting scalar field. The initial potential system employed is
semi classical in nature, becoming non classical at the end of chaotic
inflation at the same time cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein
cosmological constant. We use Scherrer's derivation of a sound speed being zero
during initial inflationary cosmology and change it afterwards as the slope of
the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. Furthermore, the
results in Bo Qin's article about extra dimensions from dark matter, permit us
to show the impact of dimensionality upon the rule of semi classical
approximations to inflation models. We conclude that the new force law
specified by Bo Qin and additional dimensions would play a role in the early
universe and be extremely important to the onset of inflationary expansion due
to nucleation of di quark pairs in a soliton-anti soliton configuration.

ecosystem model by augmenting the individual cognitive maps drawn by 8
scientists working in the area of shallow lake ecology. We calculated graph
theoretical indices of the individual cognitive maps and the collective
cognitive map produced by augmentation. The graph theoretical indices revealed
internal cycles showing non-linear dynamics in the shallow lake ecosystem. The
ecological processes were organized democratically without a top-down
hierarchical structure. The steady state condition of the generic model was a
characteristic turbid shallow lake ecosystem since there were no dynamic
environmental changes that could cause shifts between a turbid and a clearwater
state, and the generic model indicated that only a dynamic disturbance regime
could maintain the clearwater state. The model developed herein captured the
empirical behavior of shallow lakes, and contained the basic model of the
Alternative Stable States Theory. In addition, our model expanded the basic
model by quantifying the relative effects of connections and by extending it.
In our expanded model we ran 4 simulations: harvesting submerged plants,
nutrient reduction, fish removal without nutrient reduction, and
biomanipulation. Only biomanipulation, which included fish removal and nutrient
reduction, had the potential to shift the turbid state into clearwater state.
The structure and relationships in the generic model as well as the outcomes of
the management simulations were supported by actual field studies in shallow
lake ecosystems. Thus, fuzzy cognitive mapping methodology enabled us to
understand the complex structure of shallow lake ecosystems as a whole and
obtain a valid generic model based on tacit knowledge of experts in the field.

  special issue in memory of John T. Lewis","Markov Process and Related Fields 13, 391-423 (2007)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum channels can be described via a unitary coupling of system and
environment, followed by a trace over the environment state space. Taking the
trace instead over the system state space produces a different mapping which we
call the conjugate channel. We explore the properties of conjugate channels and
describe several different methods of construction. In general, conjugate
channels map M_d to M_d' with d < d', and different constructions may differ by
conjugation with a partial isometry.
  We show that a channel and its conjugate have the same minimal output entropy
and maximal output p-norm. It then follows that the additivity and
multiplicativity conjectures for these measures of optimal output purity hold
for a product of channels if and only if they also hold for the product of
their conjugates. This allows us to reduce these conjectures to the special
case of maps taking M_d to M_d' with a minimal representation of dimension at
most d.
  We find explicit expressions for the conjugates for a number of well-known
examples, including entanglement-breaking channels, unital qubit channels, the
depolarizing channel, and a subclass of random unitary channels. For the
entanglement-breaking channels, channels this yields a new class of channels
for which additivity and multiplicativity of optimal output purity can be
established. For random unitary channels using the generalized Pauli matrices,
we obtain a new formulation of the multiplicativity conjecture. The conjugate
of the completely noisy channel plays a special role and suggests a mechanism
for using noise to transmit information.
