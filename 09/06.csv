episodes of high and low X-ray intensities. The high intensity phases last
between a few to upto 110 days and the separation between two high intensity
phases also varies widely. One remarkable feature deduced from the RXTE-ASM
light curves is that during these high intensity phases, Cen X-3 manifests in
two very distinct spectral states. When the source makes a transition from the
low intensity phase to the high intensity phase, it adopts one of these two
spectral states and during the entire high intensity phase remains in that
particular spectral state. During December 2000 to April 2004, all the high
intensity episodes showed a hardness ratio which is significantly larger than
the same during all the high states prior to and subsequent to this period. It
is also found that most of the soft outbursts reach a nearly constant peak flux
in the 5--12 keV band. For comparison, similar analysis was carried out on the
long term X-ray light curves of three other X-ray binary pulsars Her X-1, Vela
X-1, and SMC X-1. Results obtained with these sources are also presented here

prediction for the primordial gravitational potential $\Phi(x)$ in scenarios in
which cosmological perturbations are generated either during or after
inflation. This enables us to make realistic predictions for a non-Gaussian
part of $\Phi(x)$, which is generically written in momentum space as a double
convolution of its Gaussian part with a suitable kernel, f_NL(k1,k2). This
kernel defines the amplitude and angular structure of the non-Gaussian signals
and originates from the evolution of second-order perturbations after the
generation of the curvature perturbation. We derive a generic formula for the
CMB angular bispectrum with arbitrary f_NL(k1,k2) and examine the detectability
of the primordial non-Gaussian signals from various scenarios such as
single-field inflation, inhomogeneous reheating, and curvaton scenarios. Our
results show that in the standard slow-roll inflation scenario the signal
actually comes from the momentum-dependent part of f_NL(k1,k2), and thus it is
important to include the momentum dependence in the data analysis. In the other
scenarios the primordial non-Gaussianity is comparable to or larger than these
post-inflationary effects. We find that WMAP cannot detect non-Gaussian signals
generated by these models. Numerical calculations for l>500 are still
computationally expensive, and we are not yet able to extend our calculations
to Planck's angular resolution; however, there is an encouraging trend which
shows that Planck may be able to detect these non-Gaussian signals.

objects at high redshift may be determined, in part, by their metal enrichment
of surrounding gas. At a critical metallicity, Zcrit, primordial gas cools more
efficiently by fine-structure lines of CII (157.74 um), OI (63.18 um, 145.5
um), SiII (34.8 um), and FeII (25.99 um, 35.35 um) than by HI or H2 emission.
This cooling may alter the process of fragmentation into smaller units. We
study the time-dependent cooling of primordial gas enriched by heavy elements
from early massive stars, particularly O, Si, and Fe. We define Zcrit as the
point when the total cooling rate by metals plus H2 equals the adiabatic
compressional heating. We explore two metallicity scenarios: (1) a single
metallicity for all heavy elements; (2) individual metallicities (Z_C, Z_O,
Z_Si, Z_Fe) from theoretical supernova yields. For dense gas [n > 10^3 cm^(-3)]
with metals in relative solar abundances, fragmentation occurs at Zcrit ~
10^(-3.5) Z_sun. However, for lower density gas, [n = 1-100 cm^(-3)],
particularly in halos enriched in Si, O, and Fe, we find Zcrit = 0.1-1% Zsun.
The critical metallicity approaches a minimum value at high-n set by efficient
LTE cooling, with thermalized level populations of fine-structure states and H2
rotational states (J = 2 and J = 3). Primordial clouds of 10^8 Msun at 200K are
detectable in redshifted fine-structure lines, with far-infrared fluxes between
10^-22 and 10^-21 W/m^2. For metallicities Z_O = 10^(-3) and molecular
fractions f(H2) = 10^(-3) the fine-structure emission lines of OI, SiII, and
FeII could be 10^2 - 10^3 times stronger than the H2 rotational lines at 28.22
um (J = 2-0) and 17.03 um (J = 3-1).

M_B=-20.3 to -23.1 in rest-frame optical luminosity, and from 4x10^9 to 2x10^11

displaced from the local ones by several magnitudes towards brighter absolute
B-band luminosity and more than an order of magnitude towards larger stellar

evolution in the B-band luminosity function of blue galaxies between z~1 and

z=2-3.5, with an average 850um flux density of 1.11+-0.28mJy. The detection
implies an average star formation rate (SFR) of 127+-34 M_sun/yr (lensing
corrected), assuming that the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distribution
(SED) is well-described by a modified blackbody. The SFR derived from the submm
agrees well with SFRs derived from SED fitting of optical-near-infrared data

extinction A_V=2.4 mag, which is consistent with the FIR to rest-frame optical
luminosity ratio of ~15. DRGs are older and have lower SFRs relative to optical
luminosity than (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies, although their FIR
luminosities are similar. The DRGs at 2<z<3.5 and the Extremely Red Objects

studying BHCs. To date, there have been three main classification schemes with
Luminosity-based, Component-based, or Transition-based criteria. The canonical,
Luminosity-based criteria and physical models that are based on this concept do
not provide clear explanations for several phenomena, including hysteresis of
spectral states and the presence of jets. I discuss the re-definitions of
states, focusing on an application of the Component-based states to more than
400 RXTE observations of the recurrent BHC 4U 1630-47. We compare the X-ray
properties for the recent 2002-2004 outburst to those of an earlier (1998)
outburst, during which radio jets were observed. The results suggest a
connection between hysteresis of states and major jet ejections, and it is
possible that both of these are related to the evolution of the inner radius of
the optically thick accretion disk.

ionisation in the 30 CFRS and in all z~1.4 galaxies is not due to AGN activity;
b) about one third of the 0.47<z<0.92 CFRS galaxies in our sample have
substantially lower metallicities than local galaxies with similar luminosities
and star formation rates; c) comparison with a chemical evolution model
indicates that these low metallicity galaxies are unlikely to be the
progenitors of metal-poor dwarf galaxies at z~0, but more likely the
progenitors of massive spirals; d) the z~1.4 galaxies are characterized by the
high [OIII]/[OII] line ratios, low extinction and low metallicity that are
typical of lower luminosity CADIS galaxies at 0.4<z<0.7, and of more luminous
Lyman Break Galaxies at z~3.1, but not seen in CFRS galaxies at 0.4<z<1.0; e)
the properties of the z~1.4 galaxies suggest that the period of rapid chemical

minimize the perturbations produced by the circumstellar environment on the

determining stellar masses and ages by simultaneously using model atmospheres
and evolutionary tracks, both calculated for rotating objects. The stellar ages
($\tau$) normalized to the respective inferred time that each rotating star can
spend in the main sequence phase ($\tau\_{\rm MS}$) reveal a mass-dependent
trend. This trend shows that: a) there are Be stars spread over the whole
interval $0 \la \tau/\tau\_{\rm MS} \la 1$ of the main sequence evolutionary
phase; b) the distribution of points in the ($\tau/\tau\_{\rm
MS},M/M\_{\odot}$) diagram indicates that in massive stars ($M \ga
12M\_{\odot}$) the Be phenomenon is present at smaller $\tau/\tau\_{\rm MS}$
age ratios than for less massive stars ($M \la 12M\_{\odot}$). This
distribution can be due to: $i$) higher mass-loss rates in massive objets,
which can act to reduce the surface fast rotation; $ii$) circulation time
scales to transport angular momentum from the core to the surface, which are
longer the lower the stellar mass.

newly-found UCDs are comparable to the UCDs in the Fornax Cluster, with sizes
<~ 100 pc, -12.9 < M_B < -10.7, and exhibiting red, absorption-line spectra,
indicative of an older stellar population. The properties of these objects
remain consistent with the tidal threshing model for the origin of UCDs from
the surviving nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticals disrupted in the cluster
core, but can also be explained as objects that were formed by mergers of star
clusters created in galaxy interactions. The discovery that UCDs exist in Virgo
shows that this galaxy type is probably a ubiquitous phenomenon in clusters of
galaxies; coupled with their possible origin by tidal threshing, the UCD
population is a potential indicator and probe of the formation history of a
given cluster.
  We also describe one additional bright UCD with M_B = -12.0 in the core of

high energy exponential cut-off at Ec ~ 50 keV is required to fit the spectrum

of ~ 2 in 10 months, showing a spectral change between the high and low state,

strength. Their robustness has been subject of debate, since it was thought
that only the resulting central mass concentrations (CMCs) were weakening bars,
and only relatively rare massive CMCs were able to completely destroy them.
Through numerical simulations including gas dynamics, we find that with the gas
parameters of normal spiral galaxies, the CMC is not sufficient to fully
dissolve the bar. But another overlooked mechanism, the transfer of angular
momentum from the infalling gas to the stellar bar, can also strongly weaken
the bar. In addition, we show that gravity torques are correctly reproduced in
simulations, and conclude that bars are transient features, with life-time of
1-2 Gyr in typical Sb-Sc galaxies, because of the combined effects of CMCs and
gravity torques, while most existing works had focussed on the CMC effects

evolutionary effects (e.g. enhanced star formation) the amplitude of this
effect and the processes for accomplishing them, are not well quantified. The
goal of the project AMIGA (Analysis of the Interstellar Medium of Isolated
Galaxies) is to provide a sizable reference sample (n=1050) of the most
isolated galaxies as a basis for the study of the influence of the environment
on galaxy properties. Here, we present the far-infrared (FIR) properties of
1030 galaxies of the sample for which IRAS data are available. We improved the
detection rate and accuracy of the IRAS data with respect to the Point Source
and Faint Source Catalog by redoing the data reduction with the IPAC utility
ADDSCAN/SCANPI. Comparing the FIR to the blue luminosities, we find a slightly
non-linear relation. Furthermore, we find that interacting galaxies tend to
have an enhanced FIR emission.

that accompanies the BCS gap equation. The four versions correspond to
explicitly accounting for two-hole-(2h) as well as two-electron-(2e) Cooper
pairs (CPs), or both in equal proportions, or only either kind. This follows
from a recent generalization of the Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC)
statistical theory that includes not boson-boson interactions but rather 2e-
and also (without loss of generality) 2h-CPs interacting with unpaired
electrons and holes in a single-band model that is easily converted into a
two-band model. The GBEC theory is essentially an extension of the
Friedberg-T.D. Lee 1989 BEC theory of superconductors that excludes 2h-CPs. It
can thus recover, when the numbers of 2h- and 2e-CPs in both BE-condensed and
noncondensed states are separately equal, the BCS gap equation for all
temperatures and couplings as well as the zero-temperature BCS
(rigorous-upper-bound) condensation energy for all couplings. But ignoring
either 2h- {\it or} 2e-CPs it can do neither. In particular, only {\it half}
the BCS condensation energy is obtained in the two crossover versions ignoring
either kind of CPs. We show how critical temperatures $T_{c}$ from the original
BCS-Bose crossover theory in 2D require unphysically large couplings for the
Cooper/BCS model interaction to differ significantly from the $T_{c}$s of
ordinary BCS theory (where the number equation is substituted by the assumption
that the chemical potential equals the Fermi energy).

low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and graph codes with message passing
decoding algorithms. With channel symmetry as one of its fundamental
assumptions, density evolution (DE) has been widely and successfully applied to
different channels, including binary erasure channels, binary symmetric
channels, binary additive white Gaussian noise channels, etc. This paper
generalizes density evolution for non-symmetric memoryless channels, which in
turn broadens the applications to general memoryless channels, e.g. z-channels,
composite white Gaussian noise channels, etc. The central theorem underpinning
this generalization is the convergence to perfect projection for any fixed size
supporting tree. A new iterative formula of the same complexity is then
presented and the necessary theorems for the performance concentration theorems
are developed. Several properties of the new density evolution method are
explored, including stability results for general asymmetric memoryless
channels. Simulations, code optimizations, and possible new applications
suggested by this new density evolution method are also provided. This result
is also used to prove the typicality of linear LDPC codes among the coset code
ensemble when the minimum check node degree is sufficiently large. It is shown
that the convergence to perfect projection is essential to the belief
propagation algorithm even when only symmetric channels are considered. Hence
the proof of the convergence to perfect projection serves also as a completion
of the theory of classical density evolution for symmetric memoryless channels.

a property of optimal prefix codes to compute the codeword lengths

the number of distinct codeword lengths as produced by the algorithm for the

the correct scale for electroweak symmetry breaking. The problem is
particularly severe in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model (MSSM). We present a solution to this problem that does not require an
extension of the MSSM at the weak scale. Superparticle masses are generated by
a comparable mixture of moduli and anomaly mediated contributions, and the
messenger scale of supersymmetry breaking is effectively lowered to the TeV
region. Crucial elements for the solution are a large A term for the top
squarks and a small B term for the Higgs doublets. Requiring no fine-tuning
worse than 20%, we obtain rather sharp predictions on the spectrum. The gaugino
masses are almost universal at the weak scale with the mass between 450 and 900
GeV. The squark and slepton masses are also nearly universal at the weak scale
with the mass a factor of \sqrt{2} smaller than that of the gauginos. The only
exception is the top squarks whose masses split from the other squark masses by
about m_t/\sqrt{2}. The lightest Higgs boson mass is smaller than 120 GeV,
while the ratio of the vacuum expectation values for the two Higgs doublets,
tan\beta, is larger than about 5. The lightest superparticle is the neutral
Higgsino of the mass below 190 GeV, which can be dark matter of the universe.
The mass of the lighter top squark can be smaller than 300 GeV, which may be
relevant for Run II at the Tevatron.

fluctuations arises from contributions of doubly charged hadrons to the

Calabi-Yau threefolds which are fibrations over a Riemann surface by computing
the partition function of q-deformed Yang-Mills theory on the Riemann surface.
We study in detail the genus zero case and obtain, at finite $N$, the instanton
expansion of the gauge theory. It can be written exactly as the partition
function for U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory on a Lens space, summed over all
non-trivial vacua, plus a tower of non-perturbative instanton contributions.
The correspondence between two and three dimensional gauge theories is
elucidated by an explicit mapping between two-dimensional Yang-Mills instantons
and flat connections on the Lens space. In the large $N$ limit we find a
peculiar phase structure in the model. At weak string coupling the theory
reduces exactly to the trivial flat connection sector with instanton
contributions exponentially suppressed, and the topological string partition
function on the resolved conifold is reproduced in this regime. At a certain
critical point all non-trivial vacua contribute, instantons are enhanced and
the theory appears to undergo a phase transition into a strong coupling regime.
We rederive these results by performing a saddle-point approximation to the
exact partition function. We obtain a q-deformed version of the Douglas-Kazakov
equation for two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the sphere, whose one-cut
solution below the transition point reproduces the resolved conifold geometry.
Above the critical point we propose a two-cut solution that should reproduce
the chiral-antichiral dynamics found for black holes on the Calabi-Yau
threefold and the Gross-Taylor string in the undeformed limit.

subspace of states of the system with a total energy below the threshold for
ionization of the atom (Rayleigh scattering). The kinematics of the electron
and the nucleus is chosen to be non-relativistic, and their spins are
neglected. In a simplified model of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion
interacting with the quantized radiation field in which the helicity of photons
is neglected and the interactions between photons and the electron and nucleus
are turned off at very high photon energies and at photon energies below an
arbitrarily small, but fixed energy (infrared cutoff), asymptotic completeness
of Rayleigh scattering is established rigorously. On the way towards proving
this result, it is shown that, after coupling the electron and the nucleus to
the photons, the atom still has a stable ground state, provided its center of
mass velocity is smaller than the velocity of light; but its excited states are
turned into resonances. The proof of asymptotic completeness then follows from
extensions of a positive commutator method and of propagation estimates for the
atom and the photons developed in previous papers.
  The methods developed in this paper can be extended to more realistic models.
It is, however, not known, at present, how to remove the infrared cutoff.

rigorous numerical analysis of EAS is carried out by means of the enhanced

distribution of constituents, coupling between them and diffusive processes in
the context of biological situations. The model is in terms of network of
mobile elements whose internal dynamics is given by differential equations
exhibiting switching and/or oscillatory behaviour. To make the model more
consistent with the underlying biological phenomena we incorporate properties
like growth and decay into the network.
  We characterise this network by calculating the usual network measures like
network efficiency, entropy growth, vertex degree distribution, geodesic
lengths, centrality as well as fractal dimensions and generalised entropy. It
is seen that the model can demonstrate the features of both scale free networks
as well as small worlds network in different parameter domains. The formation
of spatio-temporal patterns is another feature of such networks which makes
them appealing for understanding broad qualitative aspects of problems like
cell differentiation and synchronization. The response of the network to
various attack strategies(isolated and multiple) is also studied.

A 73, 022322 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.022322",,"quant-ph",,"  Given an ensemble of n spins, at least some of which are partially polarized,
we investigate the sharing of this polarization within a subspace of k spins.
We assume that the sharing results in a pseudopure state, characterized by a
single purity parameter which we call the bias. As a concrete example we
consider ensembles of spin-1/2 nuclei in liquid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) systems. The shared bias levels are compared with some current
entanglement bounds to determine whether the reduced subspaces can give rise to
entangled states.

C73 (2006) 044311","10.1103/PhysRevC.73.044311",,"quant-ph cond-mat.str-el nucl-th",,"  Assuming that the effect of the residual interaction beyond mean-field is
weak and has a short memory time, two approximate treatments of correlation in
fermionic systems by means of Markovian quantum jump are presented. A
simplified scenario for the introduction of fluctuations beyond mean-field is
first presented. In this theory, part of the quantum correlations between the
residual interaction and the one-body density matrix are neglected and jumps
occur between many-body densities formed of pairs of states $D=| \Phi_a > <
\Phi_b |/< \Phi_b . |\Phi_a >$ where $| \Phi_a >$ and $| \Phi_b >$ are
antisymmetrized products of single-particle states. The underlying Stochastic
Mean-Field (SMF) theory is discussed and applied to the monopole vibration of a
spherical $^{40}$Ca nucleus under the influence of a statistical ensemble of
two-body contact interaction. This framework is however too simplistic to
account for both fluctuation and dissipation. In the second part of this work,
an alternative quantum jump method is obtained without making the approximation
on quantum correlations. Restricting to two particles-two holes residual
interaction, the evolution of the one-body density matrix of a correlated
system is transformed into a Lindblad equation. The associated dissipative
dynamics can be simulated by quantum jumps between densities written as $D = |
\Phi >< \Phi |$ where $| \Phi >$ is a normalized Slater determinant. The
associated stochastic Schroedinger equation for single-particle wave-functions
is given.

optical cavity using continuous feedback. In order to realize such a scheme
experimentally, one must be able to perform state estimation of the atomic
motion in real time. While in theory this estimate may be provided by a
stochastic master equation describing the full dynamics of the observed system,
integrating this equation in real time is impractical. Here we derive an
approximate estimation equation for this purpose, and use it as a drive in a
feedback algorithm designed to cool the motion of the atom. We examine the
effectiveness of such a procedure using full simulations of the cavity QED
system, including the quantized motion of the atom in one dimension.

closed-form expressions are found for a photon Wigner representation describing
transformations on the orbital Poincare sphere of unitarily related families of
paraxial spatial modes.
