The observed spectral line is the (N,J = 1,1-1,0) ground state transition of
molecular oxygen at 119 GHz (2.5 mm wavelength). The center of the line is at
the LSR velocity of a number of optically thin lines from other species in the
region and the O2 line also has a very similar, narrow, line width. Within the
10 arcmin beam, the integrated line intensity is 28 mK km/s, which corresponds
to 5 sigma of the rms noise. A standard LTE analysis results in an O2 abundance
of 5E(-8), with an uncertainty of at least a factor of two. We show that
standard methods, however, do not apply in this case, as the coupling of the
Odin beam to the source structure needs to be accounted for. Preliminary model
results indicate O2 abundances to be higher by one order of magnitude than
suggested by the standard case. This model predicts the 487 GHz line of O2 to
be easily detectable by the future Herschel-HIFI facility, but to be out of

framework for lensing and cosmology, we derive analytically the deflection
angle for the point lens and the Hernquist galaxy profile, and fit
galaxy-quasar lenses in the CASTLES sample. We do this with three methods,
fitting the observed Einstein ring sizes, the image positions, or the flux
ratios. In all cases we consistently find that stars in galaxies in MOND/TeVeS
provide adequate lensing. Bekenstein's toy $\mu$ function provides more
efficient lensing than the standard MOND $\mu$ function. But for a handful of
lenses [indicated in Table 2,3, fig 16] a good fit would require a lens mass
orders of magnitude larger/smaller than the stellar mass derived from
luminosity unless the modification function $\mu$ and modification scale $a_0$
for the universal gravity were allowed to be very different from what spiral
galaxy rotation curves normally imply. We discuss the limitation of present
data and summarize constraints on the MOND $\mu$ function. We also show that
the simplest TeVeS ""minimal-matter"" cosmology, a baryonic universe with a
cosmological constant, can fit the distance-redshift relation from the
supernova data, but underpredicts the sound horizon size at the last
scattering. We conclude that lensing is a promising approach to differentiate
laws of gravity (see also astro-ph/0512425).

not follow a single power-law, but it may be described by a function that

The CMD in supersonic turbulent flows does not have a universal slope, and as

luminosity-temperature relation. The intrinsic width of the XGFP is only
0.07dex, nearly identical to that of the stellar (optical) fundamental plane

theorem or hydrostatic equilibrium, and that it is essentially independent of

shown by previous two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with mirror symmetry

the jet is initially formed as predicted due in part to magnetic pressure from
the twisting the initially uniform magnetic field and from gas pressure
associated with shock formation in the region around r = 3r_S. At later times,
the accretion disk becomes thick and the jet fades resulting in a wind that is
ejected from the surface of the thickened (torus-like) disk. It should be noted
that no streaming matter from a donor is included at the outer boundary in the
simulation (an isolated black hole not binary black hole). The wind flows
outwards with a wider angle than the initial jet. The widening of the jet is
consistent with the outward moving torsional Alfven waves (TAWs). This
evolution of disk-jet coupling suggests that the jet fades with a thickened

achieve a sub-arcsecond PSF on stacked images, where precise astrometry plays a
key role. Current astrometric standards are insufficient to achieve the science

ground-based telescopes and make a substantial contribution to our
understanding of stellar populations in the Milky Way. In this paper we
motivate the need for such standards and discuss the strategy of their

demonstrated by a pilot study around the open cluster NGC 188, using the KPNO

reaching an accuracy of 5-10 mas in positions and obtaining absolute proper

at widely separated coordinates. In addition to their utilitarian purpose for
DAS, the data we will obtain in these fields will enable fundamental Galactic

in sources brighter at 16$\mu$m than at 24$\mu$m at z $\sim$ 1--1.8 by at least
20%. With a threshold flux ratio of 1.2, restricting our analysis to $>5\sigma$

the number of silicate-absorbed ULIRG candidates is 36. This defines a strong
upper limit of $\sim$920 sources deg$^{-2}$, on the population of

formed more than 7 Gyr ago (at z > 1), coupled with a high metallicity
(1.0Z_{\odot} < Z_{ICL} \la 2.5Z_{\odot}), and a more centralized component
which contains stars formed within the past 5 Gyr (at z ~ 1). The profile of

novel method. The radial profile of the Gini coefficient -- a model-independent
structure parameter -- is able to detect bars in early-type galaxies that are
large enough that they might host an inner bar of sufficient angular size.
Using this method and subsequent examination with unsharp masks and ellipse
fits we identified the two most distant S2Bs currently known (at redshifts
z=0.103 and z=0.148). We investigate the underlying stellar populations of
these two galaxies through a detailed colour analysis, in order to demonstrate
the analysis that could be performed on a future sample of
intermediate-redshift S2Bs. We also identify two S2Bs and five S2B candidates
in the HST/ACS data of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). Our detections of
distant S2Bs show that deep surveys like GOODS and COSMOS have the potential to
push the limit for S2B detection and analysis out by a factor of ten in
redshift and lookback time (z=0.5, t=5Gyr) compared to the previously known
S2Bs. This in turn would provide new insight into the formation of these

expanding universe and a non-expanding universe. For surface brightness
measured in AB magnitudes per angular area, all FRW models, regardless of
cosmological parameters, predict that surface brightness declines with redshift
as (z+1)^-3, while any non-expanding model predicts that surface brightness is
constant with distance and thus with z. High-z UV surface brightness data for
galaxies from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and low-z data from GALEX are used to
test the predictions of these two models up to z=6. A preliminary analysis
presented here of samples observed at the same at-galaxy wavelengths in the UV
shows that surface brightness is constant, mu=kz^0.026+-0.15, consistent with
the non-expanding model. This relationship holds if distance is linearly
proportional to z at all redshifts, but seems insensitive to the particular
choice of d-z relationship. Attempts to reconcile the data with FRW predictions
by assuming that high-z galaxies have intrinsically higher surface brightness
than low-z galaxies appear to face insurmountable problems. The intrinsic FUV
surface brightness required by the FRW models for high-z galaxies exceeds the
maximum FUV surface brightness of any low-z galaxy by as much as a factor of
40. Dust absorption appears to make such extremely high intrinsic FUV surface
brightness physically impossible. If confirmed by further analysis, the
impossibility of such high-surface-brightness galaxies would rule out all FRW
expanding universe (big bang) models.

fractional contribution made by C stars to the total AGB light in the K-band is

that the Lyman alpha emission profiles, equivalent widths, and continuum break

two massive, young stars: the previously-identified star that is associated
with the radio HII region H2, and a newly-identified star that we refer to as

Br-gamma and He I lines, and resemble those of massive supergiants that have
evolved off of the main sequence, but not yet reached the Wolf-Rayet phase. We
estimate that each star has a bolometric luminosity >10^6 L_sun. The detection
of these two sources in X-rays is surprising, because stars at similar
evolutionary states are not uniformly bright X-ray sources. Therefore, we
suggest that both stars are in binary systems that contain either OB stars
whose winds collide with those of the luminous supergiants, or compact objects
that are accreting from the winds of the supergiants. We also identify X-ray
emission from a nitrogen-type Wolf-Rayet star and place upper limits on the
X-ray luminosities of three more evolved, massive stars that previously have
been identified between 1 and 25 pc from Sgr A*. Finally, we briefly discuss
the implications that future searches for young stars will have for our

theoretical timescales for producing eccentricities and circularising the
binaries are consistent with what is needed to produce the observed population
of flaring sources, although the circularisation timescales are highly
uncertain on both observational and theoretical grounds. This model makes two
clear theoretical predictions (1) the flares should be seen to be strictly
periodic if adequate sampling is provided, and that periodicity should be of
approximately 15 hours (2) this class of flaring behaviour should be seen only
in globular cluster sources, and predominantly in the densest globular
clusters. We also test the model for producing eccentricities through fly-by's
of a third star near the binary in a globular cluster against a much larger
database of millisecond pulsar observations than has been used in past work,

distribution and stellar mass function. Here we investigate the feasibility of
using such a survey to detect planets in M31. We estimate the efficiency of
detecting signals for events induced by planetary systems as a function of
planet/star mass ratio and separation, source type and background M31 surface
brightness. We find that for planets of a Jupiter-mass or above that are within
the lensing zone (~1 -3 AU) detection is possible above 3 $\sigma$, with
detection efficiencies ~3% for events associated with giant stars, which are
the typical source stars of pixel-lensing surveys. A dramatic improvement in
the efficiency of ~40 -- 60% is expected if follow-up observations on an 8m
telescope are made possible by a real-time alert system.

positions of these galaxies have been pointed out by several authors.
Gravitational lensing by dark matter has been proposed as the cause of these

not work at all for correlations with the brightest and nearest galaxies. Some
of these cases may be just fortuitous associations in which background objects
are close in the sky to a foreground galaxy, although the statistical mean
correlations remain to be explained and some lone objects have very small
probabilities of being a projection of background objects.
  The sample of discordant redshift associations given in Arp's atlas is indeed
quite large, and most of the objects remain to be analysed thoroughly. For

binaries: PSR B1259-63 and LS 5039. In both, the early-type star provides large
numbers of target photons for pair-production with TeV gamma-rays. This results
in a modulation of the gamma-ray flux as the relative positions of the
gamma-ray source and companion star change with orbital phase. The lightcurve
and spectrum of absorption provide useful diagnostics for the location and
nature of gamma-ray emission. The expected orbital variations of the absorption
spectrum and flux are calculated for LS 5039, PSR B1259-63 and LSI +61 303, a
system similar to LS 5039 but still undetected at TeV energies. In LS 5039,
emission close to a black hole or a neutron star primary is considered. In both
cases, the flux above 250 GeV drops by more than an order-of-magnitude near
periastron due to absorption. A black hole yields a clear spectral signature in
the average spectrum at 400 GeV. A neutron star yields more variability, with
the spectral feature moving from 200 GeV to 2 TeV. The absorbed fraction of the
flux can be as small as 20%, allowing for an almost direct view of the
intrinsic spectrum. Low variability requires emission on large scales, more
than 0.7 AU away to have <50% absorption in a jet. Such predictions are
essential to distinguish between variability due to the gamma-ray emission
process from that due to absorption. A modulation in LS 5039 would provide a
novel way to constrain the gamma-ray source. Its absence would imply that
gamma-ray emission occurs on large scales.

the discovery of a flattened disk-like structure observed at submillimeter

Its perpendicular orientation to, and spatial coincidence with the central

outburst that involves both an accretion instability and an increase in
thermonuclear shell burning on the surface of an accreting white dwarf. We
refer to this new type of eruption as a combination nova. In late 2000, the
prototypical symbiotic star Z Andromedae brightened by roughly two magnitudes
in the optical. We observed the outburst in the radio with the VLA and MERLIN,
in the optical both photometrically and spectroscopically, in the far
ultraviolet with FUSE, and in the X-rays with both Chandra and XMM. The
two-year-long event had three distinct stages. During the first stage, the
optical rise closely resembled an earlier, small outburst that was caused by an
accretion-disk instability. In the second stage, the hot component ejected an
optically thick shell of material. In the third stage, the shell cleared to
reveal a white dwarf whose luminosity remained on the order of 10^4 Lsun for
approximately one year. The eruption was thus too energetic to have been
powered by accretion alone. We propose that the initial burst of accretion was
large enough to trigger enhanced nuclear burning on the surface of the white
dwarf and the ejection of an optically thick shell of material. This outburst
therefore combined elements of both a dwarf nova and a classical nova. Our
results have implications for the long-standing problem of producing shell
flashes with short recurrence times on low-mass white dwarfs in symbiotic
stars.

reinforced with increasing the annealing oxygen pressure, while the annealing
under high oxygen pressure suppresses the ferromagnetic ordering. Contrary to
the case of the \emph{iron-free} sample, no spin-state transition is induced by
the annealing under high oxygen pressure for the \emph{iron-doped} samples, and
the ferromagnetic transition temperature is nearly independent of the annealing

attributed to the reduction of the cell volume. The suppression of the

ferromagnetism by the iron-doping might arise from the ferromagnetic exchange

However, the latter approximation turned out to yield unphysical critical

convergence properties of the DE. The author has since realized that in fact,
this approximation may not be valid for the KPZ problem, because of the very
nature of the KPZ interaction, which is not {\em potential} but {\em
derivative}. The probable failure of the DE is a very unusual -- and
instructive -- feature within the NPRG framework. As such, the original work,

  We compare the spinless fermion case, in which only isolated polarons can be
formed, with the spinful model in which the polarons can bind and form
bipolarons. In the latter case, the bipolaronic binding occurs through a
metal-insulator transition. In the adiabatic regime in which the phonon energy
is small with respect to the electron hopping we compare numerically exact DMFT
results with an analytical scheme inspired by the Born-Oppenheimer procedure.
Within the latter approach,a truncation of the phononic Hilbert space leads to
a mapping of the original model onto an Anderson spin-fermion model. In the
anti-adiabatic regime (where the phonon energy exceeds the electronic scales)
the standard treatment based on Lang-Firsov canonical transformation allows to
map the original model on to an attractive Hubbard model in the spinful case.
The separate analysis of the two regimes supports the numerical evidence that
polaron formation is not necessarily associated to a metal-insulator
transition, which is instead due to pairing between the carriers. At the
polaron crossover the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is shown to break down due
to the entanglement of the electron-phonon state.

embedding and lossless compression (of the composite signal) was studied in the
absence \cite{MM03} and in the presence \cite{MM04} of attacks, here we
consider the additional ingredient of protecting the secrecy of the watermark
against an unauthorized party, which has no access to a secret key shared by
the legitimate parties. In other words, we study the problem of joint coding
for three objectives: information embedding, compression, and encryption.Our
main result is a coding theorem that provides a single--letter characterization
of the best achievable tradeoffs among the following parameters: the distortion
between the composite signal and the covertext, the distortion in
reconstructing the watermark by the legitimate receiver, the compressibility of
the composite signal (with and without the key), and the equivocation of the
watermark, as well as its reconstructed version, given the composite signal. In
the attack--free case, if the key is independent of the covertext, this coding
theorem gives rise to a {\it threefold} separation principle that tells that
asymptotically, for long block codes, no optimality is lost by first applying a
rate--distortion code to the watermark source, then encrypting the compressed
codeword, and finally, embedding it into the covertext using the embedding
scheme of \cite{MM03}. In the more general case, however, this separation
principle is no longer valid, as the key plays an additional role of side
information used by the embedding unit.

that the problem of determining if a received word is a deep hole is
co-NP-complete. The reduction relies on the fact that the evaluation set of the

codes do not usually possess. In this paper, we first presented a much simpler
proof of the same result. We then consider the problem for standard
Reed-Solomon codes, i.e. the evaluation set consists of all the nonzero
elements in the field. We reduce the problem of identifying deep holes to
deciding whether an absolutely irreducible hypersurface over a finite field
contains a rational point whose coordinates are pairwise distinct and nonzero.
By applying Schmidt and Cafure-Matera estimation of rational points on
algebraic varieties, we prove that the received vector $(f(\alpha))_{\alpha \in

there is no interference between the different triangulations. We prove
non-negativity by transforming the model into a ``dual variables'' formulation
in which the amplitude for a given triangulation is expressed as an integral
over three copies of hyperbolic space for each tetrahedron. Then we prove that,
expressed in this way, the integrand is non-negative. In addition to implying
that the amplitude is non-negative, the non-negativity of the integrand is
highly significant from the point of view of numerical computations, as it
allows statistical methods such as the Metropolis algorithm to be used for
efficient computation of expectation values of observables.

approaches the black hole, its orbit is disrupted by the tidal force. The final
plunging velocity increases in the non-relativistic case, but decreases if the
initial circular velocity exceeds a critical value, which is approximately
0.7c. This toy model suggests that disruption of a rapidly rotating star due to
a velocity-dependent tidal force may be quite different from that of a
non-relativistic star. The model also suggested that collapse of the orbit
after the disruption is slow in general, so that the particle subsequently
escapes outside the valid Fermi coordinates.

sizeable invisible final state branching fraction. Details of the hidden sector
determine whether the overall width of the lightest state is smaller or larger

invisible decay branching fractions within the general framework. We also
introduce the ``A-Higgs Model'', which corresponds to the limit of a hidden
sector Higgs boson weakly mixing with the Standard Model Higgs boson. This
model has only one free parameter in addition to the mass of the light Higgs
state and it illustrates most of the generic phenomenology issues, thereby
enabling it to be a good benchmark theory for collider searches. We end by
presenting an analogous supersymmetry model with similar phenomenology, which

including the effect of D-terms arising from an Abelian U(1) family symmetry,
non-aligned trilinear contributions from scalar F-terms, as well as non-minimal
supergravity contributions and the effect of different Yukawa textures. In
order to quantify these effects, we investigate a string inspired effective
supergravity model arising from intersecting D-branes supplemented by an
additional U(1) family symmetry. In such theories the magnitude of the D-terms
is predicted, and we calculate the branching ratios for $\mu\to e\gamma$ and
$\tau \to \mu \gamma$ for different benchmark points designed to isolate the
different non-minimal contributions. We find that the D-term contributions are
generally dangerously large, but in certain cases such contributions can lead
to a dramatic suppression of LFV rates, for example by cancelling the effect of
the see-saw induced LFV in $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ models with lop-sided
textures. In the class of string models considered here we find the surprising
result that the D-terms can sometimes serve to restore universality in the

hierarchically small scale of supersymmetry breakdown rather than adjusting its
size to a constant. A crucial ingredient is the appearance of the
hierarchically small quantity exp(-<X>) which corresponds to the scale of
gaugino condensation. Under rather general circumstances, this leads to a
scenario of moduli stabilization, which is endowed with a hierarchy between the
mass of the lightest modulus, the gravitino mass and the scale of the soft
terms, m_modulus ~ <X> m_3/2 ~ <X>^2 m_soft. The `little hierarchy' <X> is
given by the logarithm of the ratio of the Planck scale and the gravitino mass,
<X> ~ log(M_Pl/m_3/2) ~ 4pi^2. This exhibits a new mediation scheme of
supersymmetry breakdown, called mirage mediation. We highlight the special
properties of the scheme, and their consequences for phenomenology and

string charged under a 2-bundle, or gerbe. This stringification is nothing but
categorification. We look at supersymmetric quantum mechanics on loop space and
demonstrate how deformations here give rise to superstring background fields
and boundary states, and, when generalized, to local nonabelian connections on
loop space. In order to get a global description of these connections we
introduce and study categorified global holonomy in the form of 2-bundles with
2-holonomy. We show how these relate to nonabelian gerbes and go beyond by
obtaining global nonabelian surface holonomy, thus providing a class of action
functionals for nonabelian strings. The examination of the differential
formulation, which is adapted to the study of nonabelian p-form gauge theories,
gives rise to generalized nonabelian Deligne hypercohomology. The (possible)
relation of this to strings in Kalb-Ramond backgrounds, to M2/M5-brane systems,
to spinning strings and to the derived category description of D-branes is

totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in Z. The basic coupling
induces a multiclass process which is useful in discussing shock measures and
other important properties of the processes. The invariant measures of the
multiclass systems are the same for both processes, and can be constructed as
the law of the output process of a system of multiclass queues in tandem; the
arrival and service processes of the queueing system are a collection of
independent Bernoulli product measures. The proof of invariance involves a new
coupling between stationary versions of the processes called a multi-line
process; this process has a collection of independent Bernoulli product
measures as an invariant measure. Some of these results have appeared elsewhere
and this paper is partly a review, with some proofs given only in outline.
However we emphasize a new approach via dual points: when the graphical
construction is used to construct a trajectory of the TASEP or HAD process as a
function of a Poisson process in ZxR, the dual points are those which govern
the time-reversal of the trajectory. Each line of the multi-line process is
governed by the dual points of the line below. We also mention some other
processes whose multiclass versions have the same invariant measures, and we
note an extension of Burke's theorem to multiclass queues which follows from
the results.

a family of finite simple groups, if the exponent of the groups in the family

are found to be $^{72}$Ca and $^{59}$Ca, respectively. In Ni isotopes, the
corresponding nuclei are $^{98}$Ni and $^{97}$Ni, respectively. The origin of
this difference in relative positions of the dripline in even and odd isotopes
in the two chain is traced to the difference in the single particle level
structures and consequent modification in the magic numbers in the two
elements. Pairing interaction is seen to play a major role. The effect of the
width of the resonance states on pairing has also been investigated.

protein structures that covers the three branches of life on earth. Our results
show that the probability degree distribution of network connectivity follows
Poisson's distribution; whereas the probability strength distribution does not
follow any known distribution. However, the average strength of amino acid node
depends on its degree (k). For some of the proteins, the strength of a node
increases linearly with k. On the other hand, for a set of other proteins,
although the strength increases linaerly with k for smaller values of k, we
have not obtained any clear functional relationship of strength with degree at
higher values of k. The results also show that the weight of the amino acid
nodes belonging to the highly connected nodes tend to have a higher value. The
result that the average clustering coefficient of weighted network is less than
that of unweighted network implies that the topological clustering is generated
by edges with low weights. The ratio of average clustering coefficients of
protein network to that of the corresponding classical random network varies
linearly with the number (N) of amino acids of a protein; whereas the ratio of
characteristic path lengths varies logarithmically with N. The power law
behaviour of clustering coefficients of weighted and unweighted network as a
function of degree k indicates that the network has a signature of hierarchical
network. It has also been observed that the network is of assortative type.

different couplings to produce the atom-atom thermal entanglement in two-photon
process. The different atomic spontaneous emission rates are also utilizable in
generating thermal entanglement. We also investigate the effect of the cavity
leakage. To the initial atomic state $|ee> ,$a slight leakage can relieve the
restriction of interaction time and we can obtain a large and steady
entanglement.

photon sources which nonetheless emit photons at the same frequency. It is also
hard to create entangled photon pairs from quantum dots. In the spirit of
quantum engineering we propose a simple optical circuit which can, in the right
circumstances, make frequency distinguishable photons frequency
indistinguishable. Our circuit can supply a downstream solution to both
problems, opening up a large window of allowed frequency mismatches between
physical mechanisms. The only components used are spectrum analysers/prisms and
an Acousto-Optic Modulator. We also note that an Acousto-Optic Modulator can be
used to obtain Hong-Ou-Mandel two photon interference effects from the
frequency distinguishable photons generated by distinct sources.

external electromagnetic field periodic and quasiperiodic in time. The quantum
evolution is described exactly by the classical equations of motion of a
gyromagnet in a time-dependent magnetic field. We prove that this classical
system is integrable as a consequence of the underlying unitary quantum
dynamics. As a consequence, for the periodic case: i) rigorous assessment of
the validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) becomes possible even
beyond the assumptions of resonance and weak coupling (the latter conditions
are also shown to follow from the method of averaging); ii) we determine
conditions for the realization of the quantum NOT operation beyond the RWA, by
means of classical stroboscopic maps. The results bear upon areas as diverse as
quantum optics, nuclear magnetic resonance, and quantum computation.

  correction","Annals of Physics 321 (2006) 1103--1125","10.1016/j.aop.2005.09.006",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate whether quantum history theories can be consistent with
Bayesian reasoning and whether such an analysis helps clarify the
interpretation of such theories. First, we summarise and extend recent work
categorising two different approaches to formalising multi-time measurements in
quantum theory. The standard approach consists of describing an ordered series
of measurements in terms of history propositions with non-additive
`probabilities'. The non-standard approach consists of defining multi-time
measurements to consist of sets of exclusive and exhaustive history
propositions and recovering the single-time exclusivity of results when
discussing single-time history propositions. We analyse whether such history
propositions can be consistent with Bayes' rule. We show that certain class of
histories are given a natural Bayesian interpretation, namely the linearly
positive histories originally introduced by Goldstein and Page. Thus we argue
that this gives a certain amount of interpretational clarity to the
non-standard approach. We also attempt a justification of our analysis using
Cox's axioms of probability theory.

respect to zero-temperature vacuum will thermalize at a finite temperature (the
so-called Unruh temperature) that is proportional to the acceleration. However,
the question of whether or not the system actually radiates is highly
controversial. Thus, we are motivated to present an exact calculation using a
generalized quantum Langevin equation to describe an oscillator (the detector)
moving under a constant force and coupled to a one-dimensional scalar field
(scalar electrodynamics). Moreover, our analysis is simplified by using the
oscillator as a detector. We show that this system does not radiate despite the
fact that it does in fact thermalize at the Unruh temperature. We remark upon a
differing opinion expressed regarding a system coupled to the electromagnetic
field.
