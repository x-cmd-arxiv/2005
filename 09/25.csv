to the high dissociative reaction rate of LiH +H -> Li + H_2. LiH does not
become an important coolant in any density range. The luminous emission lines
from the prestellar cores include H_2 rovibrational lines: 1-0 Q(1), 1-0 O(3),
1-0 O(5), and pure rotational lines: 0-0 S(3), 0-0 S(4), 0-0 S(5). The

29, Saurer 1, and vdB-Hagen 176 (BH 176). These clusters are spatially
coincident with GASS, but radial velocities and spectroscopic metallicities had
not been available during previous studies of the GASS candidate cluster
system. Similar data for the clusters Berkeley 20 and Berkeley 39 have been
obtained for calibration purposes. We provide the first {\it reliable} radial
velocity for BH 176 (V_{helio} = 11.2 +/- 5.3 km/s). We also find that
V_{helio} = +95.4 +/- 3.6 and +28.4 +/- 3.6 km/s, for Saurer 1(A) and Berkeley
29, respectively. We show that alpha-enhanced isochrones, while
spectroscopically motivated, provide a poor fit to Be29 in contrast to previous
findings. We find that the clusters Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1 are consistent
with the previously reported characteristics for GASS candidate clustersand the
GASS stellar stream as derived from M-giant observations. However, the radial
velocity and photometric metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ 0.0 dex) for BH 176 suggests
that a connection of this cluster with the putative GASS cluster system is
unlikely. We reassess the age-metallicity relation for the most likely members
of the GASS clusters system for which spectroscopic metallicities are now
available.

numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. The large-scale forcing
is modulated via periodic energy input variations at frequency $\omega$. The
response is maximal for frequencies in the range of the inverse of the large
eddy turnover time, confirming the mean-field predictions of von der Heydt,
Grossmann and Lohse (Phys. Rev. E 67, 046308 (2003)). In accordance with the
theory the response maximum shows only a small dependence on the Reynolds
number and is also quite insensitive to the particular flow-quantity that is
monitored, e.g., kinetic energy, dissipation-rate, or Taylor-Reynolds number.
At sufficiently high frequencies the amplitude of the kinetic energy response
decreases as $1/\omega$. For frequencies beyond the range of maximal response,
a significant change in phase-shift relative to the time-modulated forcing is
observed.

to the age phenotype may differ among individuals, creating variability in
aging manifestations among age-peers. Capturing this variability can
significantly advance understanding the aging and mortality. An index of
age-associated health disorders (deficits), called a ""frailty index"" (FI),
appears to be a promising characteristic of such processes. In this study we
address the connections of the FI with age focusing on disabled individuals who
might be at excessive risk of frailty. Methods: The National Long Term Care
Survey (NLTCS) assessed health and functioning of the U.S. elderly in 1982,
1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. Detailed information for our sample was assessed
from about 26,700 interviews. The individual FI is defined as a proportion of
deficits for a given person. We perform cross-sectional empirical analysis of
the FI age-patterns. Results: FI in the NLTCS exhibits accelerated (quadratic)
increase with age. Deficits might accumulate faster among the elderly who, at
younger ages, had a low mean FI (""healthy"" group) than a high FI (""disabled""
group). Age-patterns for ""healthy"" and ""disabled"" groups converge at advanced
ages. The rate of deficit accumulation is sex-sensitive. Convergence of the
(sex-specific) FI for ""healthy"" and ""disabled"" groups in later ages determines
biological age limits, associated with given levels of health-maintenance in
the society, which correspond to 109.4 years for females and 92.5 years for
males. Conclusions: The FI can be employed as a measure of biological age and
population heterogeneity for modeling aging processes and mortality in elderly
individuals.
