within the SDSS, as a function of both local environment and redshift. The
distance to the nearest cluster of galaxies and the distance to the 10th
nearest luminous neighbor were used to define two extremes in environment. The
properties of early-type galaxies are weakly but significantly different in
these two extremes: objects in dense environments are less than ~1 Gyr older
and alpha-enhanced by ~0.02 relative to their counterparts of the same velocity
dispersion in less dense regions, but the metallicities show no dependence on
environment. This suggests that, in dense regions, the stars in early-type
galaxies formed at slightly earlier times, and on a slightly shorter timescale,
than in less dense regions. In addition, objects at lower redshifts are older,
but have the same metallicities and alpha-enhancements as their counterparts of
the same sigma at higher redshifts, as expected if the low redshift sample is a
passively-aged version of the sample at higher redshifts. These significant
conclusions are derived from several pieces of evidence discussed in this
paper, including the FP of early-types, the observed evolution of absorption
linestrengths (measured from a large ensemble of composite spectra which we
provide in tabular form) over small lookback times, and comparison with the
predictions of single burst (non-solar abundance) stellar population synthesis
models (which also indicate that age, metallicity and alpha-enhancement all
increase with velocity dispersion).

Our simulated disks settle down quickly and do not evolve much since redshift

found to be differentially rotating. Comparison to rotation laws in stars of
spectral type A reveals that differential rotation sets in at the convection
boundary in the HR-diagram; no star that is significantly hotter than the
convection boundary exhibits the signatures of differential rotation. Four late
A-/early F-type stars close to the convection boundary and at vsini~100 km/s
show extraordinarily strong absolute shear at short rotation periods around one
day. It is suggested that this is due to their small convection zone depth and
that it is connected to a narrow range in surface velocity. Detection
frequencies of differential rotation were analyzed in stars with varying
temperature and rotation velocity. Measurable differential rotation is more
frequent in late-type stars and slow rotators. The strength of absolute shear
and differential rotation are examined as functions of the stellar effective
temperature and rotation period. The strongest shear is found at rotation
periods between two and three days. In slower rotators, the strongest shear at
a given rotation rate is given approximately by DOmega_max ~ P^{-1}. In faster
rotators, alpha_max and DOmega_max diminish less rapidly. A comparison with
differential rotation measurements in stars of later spectral type shows that
F-stars exhibit stronger shear than cooler stars do, the upper boundary in

been reionized at very high redshift. It is often suggested that the ionizing
UV flux originates from an early population of massive or very massive stars.
Depending on their mass, such stars can explode either as type II supernovae or
pair-instability supernovae, or may entirely collapse into a black hole. The
resulting neutrino emission can be quite different in each case. We consider
here the relic neutrino background produced by an early burst of Population III
stars coupled with a normal mode of star formation at lower redshift. The
computation is performed in the framework of hierarchical structure formation
and is based on cosmic star formation histories constrained to reproduce the
observed star formation rate at redshift z \la 6, the observed chemical
abundances in damped Lyman alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium, and
to allow for an early reionization of the Universe at z \sim 10-20. We find
that although the high redshift burst of Population III stars does lead to an
appreciable flux of neutrinos at relatively low energy (E_\nu \approx 1 MeV),
the observable neutrino flux is dominated by the normal mode of star formation.
We also find that predicted fluxes are at the present level of the SuperK
limit. As a consequence, the supernova relic neutrino background has a direct
impact on models of chemical evolution and/or supernova dynamics.

the direction of their hosts. Further, on scales < 50 kpc the major axes of the
host galaxies and their satellites are preferentially aligned. Phrased in the
terminology of weak lensing, the images of the satellites have a mean shear of
gamma_T = -0.045 +/- 0.010, averaged over scales 10 kpc < r < 50 kpc. In a
galaxy-galaxy lensing study where lenses and sources are separated solely on
the basis of apparent magnitude, we estimate that on scales < 250 kpc satellite
galaxies acount for between 10% and 15% of the objects that are identified as

of the galaxy-galaxy lensing shear by of order 25% to 40%. Hence, the
elongation of satellite galaxies in the direction of their hosts is a
potentially important effect for precision studies of galaxy-galaxy lensing and
argues strongly in favor favor of the use of accurate photometric redshifts in

transit. For this analysis we used 5550 spectra, obtained in 150 exposures
during a period of >7 hours. We found that IFS offers 3 fundamental advantages
with respect to previously used methods. (i) It improves the effective S/N in
photon limited observations by distributing the light coming from the star into
the 2 dimensions of the detector. (ii) This type of IFS data allows to
'auto-calibrate' instrumental and background effects. (iii) Since the star
image characteristics as well as its photometric properties are extracted from
the same data-cube, it is possible to decorrelate photometric instabilities
induced by PSF variations. These data have also allowed us to explore the
accuracy limits of ground based 'relative' spectrophotometry. This was done
using a photometric index that probes the NaD lines, for which we obtained a
nominal 1-sigma error of ~1.0x10^-4. This result, based on observations of only
1 transit, indicates that this type of ground observation can constrain the
characterization of the transmission spectrum of extrasolar planets. The
present observations are compatible with no extra NaD depression during the
transit. Though this result seems to be inconsistent with the recently reported
HST-STIS findings we point out its limited statistical meaning: the results
disagree within 1-sigma, but agree within 2-sigma. We also give some
recommenda-tions to instrument developers in order to enhance the efficiency of
the method.

massive jet ejections are rare and short events, they have hardly been observed
in X-ray so far. In this paper, the first X-ray observation of a massive jet
ejection from the microquasar SS 433 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) is reported. SS 433 undergoing a massive ejection event shows a variety
of new phenomena including a QPO-like feature near 0.1 Hz, rapid time
variability, and shot-like activities. The shot-like activity may be caused by
the formation of a small plasma bullet. A massive jet may be consist of
thousands of those plasma bullets ejected from the binary system. The size,
mass, internal energy, and kinetic energy of the bullets and the massive jet
are estimated.

implications both for the formation of stars in discs in the nuclei of active
galaxies, and for the formation of gaseous planets or brown dwarfs in
circumstellar discs. It is now well established that fragmentation occurs if
the disc is cooled on a timescale smaller than the local dynamical timescale,
while for longer cooling times the disc reaches a quasi-steady state in thermal
equilibrium, with the cooling rate balanced by the heating due to gravitational
stresses. We investigate here how the fragmentation boundary depends on the
assumed equation of state. We find that the cooling time required for
fragmentation increases as the specific heat ratio, gamma, decreases, exceeding
the local dynamical timescale for gamma = 7/5. This result can be easily
interpreted as a consequence of there being a maximum stress (in units of the
local disc pressure) that can be sustained by a self-gravitating disc in
quasi-equilibrium. Fragmentation occurs if the cooling time is such that the
stress required to reach thermal equilibrium exceeds this value, independent of
gamma. This result suggest that a quasi-steady, self-gravitating disc can never
produce a stress that results in the viscous alpha parameter exceeding ~ 0.06.

are put into steady differential rotation, the viscous torque exerted on the
spheres oscillates quasiperiodically and persistently (after an initial
transient). The fractional oscillation amplitude ($\sim 10^{-2}$) increases
with the angular shear and decreases with the gap width. (ii) When the outer
sphere is accelerated impulsively after an interval of steady differential

persistently as in (i). The relaxation time-scale is determined principally by
the angular velocity jump, whereas the oscillation amplitude is determined
principally by the gap width. (iii) When the mutual friction force changes

it builds up in time. This approach is conveniently represented by Feynman
diagrams constructed in terms of three objects: the initial conditions (e.g.
perturbation spectrum), the vertex (describing non-linearities) and the
propagator (describing linear evolution). We show that loop corrections to the
linear power spectrum organize themselves into two classes of diagrams: one
corresponding to mode-coupling effects, the other to a renormalization of the
propagator. Resummation of the latter gives rise to a quantity that measures
the memory of perturbations to initial conditions as a function of scale. As a
result of this, we show that a well-defined (renormalized) perturbation theory
follows, in the sense that each term in the remaining mode-coupling series
dominates at some characteristic scale and is subdominant otherwise. This is
unlike standard perturbation theory, where different loop corrections can
become of the same magnitude in the nonlinear regime. In companion papers we
compare the resummation of the propagator with numerical simulations, and apply
these results to the calculation of the nonlinear power spectrum. Remarkably,
the expressions in renormalized perturbation theory can be written in a way
that closely resembles the halo model.

quandrant, and a Gaussian distribution. We calculate the residual line
intensities obtained from our inhomogeneous coverage models and then use these

covering factors assuming HPC. We find that the resulting spatially-averaged
optical depths are comparable (within a factor of $\lesssim 1.5$) to the
average optical depths of the input distributions, as long as the input
distributions do not contain spatially narrow ``spikes.'' Such spikes (very
large optical depths over a small coverage area) can profoundly affect the
average optical depth in the absorber but have little impact on the observed
intensities. We also study the converse approach: we start with HPC as the
assumed physical model and then infer the parameters of the inhomogeneous
coverage models through a doublet analysis. Again the resulting average optical
depths are comparable to the corresponding quantity of the input distribution.
Finally, we construct a more realistic two-dimensional optical depth
distriubution based on a random distribution of absorbing clouds, and we use
that to calculate observed intensities. A doublet analysis applied to those

estimate of the true average optical depth, while the powerlaw yields the best

afterglow spectral properties of GRB 001025A, we argue that some bursts appear
optically dark because their afterglow is faint and their cooling frequency is
close to the X-ray band. This interpretation is applicable to several of the
few other dark bursts where the X-ray spectral index has been measured. The
X-ray afterglow flux of GRB 001025A is an order of magnitude lower than for
typical long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The spectrum of the X-ray afterglow can
be fitted with an absorbed synchrotron emission model, an absorbed thermal
plasma model, or a combination thereof. For the latter, an extrapolation to
optical wavelengths can be reconciled with the R-band upper limit on the
afterglow, without invoking any optical circumburst absorption, provided the
cooling frequency is close to the X-ray band. Alternatively, if the X-ray
afterglow is due to synchrotron emission only, seven magnitudes of extinction
in the observed R-band is required to meet the R-band upper limit, making GRB
001025A much more obscured than bursts with detected optical afterglows. Based
on the column density of X-ray absorbing circumburst matter, an SMC gas-to-dust
ratio is insufficient to produce this amount of extinction. The X-ray tail of
the prompt emission enters a steep temporal decay excluding that the tail of
the prompt emission is the onset of the afterglow (abridged).

emission in the $2-10 \kev$ band results from the shocked secondary stellar
wind. The observed rise in X-ray luminosity just before minimum is due to
increase in density and subsequent decrease in radiative cooling time of the
shocked fast secondary wind. Absorption, particularly of the soft X-rays from
the primary wind, increases as the system approaches periastron and the shocks
are produced deep inside the primary wind. However, absorption can not account
for the drastic X-ray minimum. The 70 day minimum is assumed to result from the
collapse of the collision region of the two winds onto the secondary star. This
process is assumed to shut down the secondary wind, hence the main X-ray
source. We show that this assumption provides a phenomenological description of
the X-ray behavior around the minimum.

large velocity widths of 80-100 km/s, suggestive of expansion at ~50 km/s.
Modeled as an expanding bubble, each shell has an age of ~0.5 Myr and needed
kinetic energy of ~1E46 J as well as mean mechanical luminosity of ~1E33 W for
its formation. The large energy allows each to be called a superbubble. A ~10^6

block of the nuclear starburst in NGC 253. Alternatively, a hypernova can also
be the main source of energy for each superbubble, not only because it can

rate of superbubble formation and that of hypernova explosions are comparable.
Our observations indicate that the circumnuclear molecular disk harboring the

individual young clusters and stellar explosions, in addition to globally
disturbed in the form of the well-known superwind.

when a magnetic field gradient is present, the resulting circular polarization
derived is caused predominantly by the average magnetic field in the

total extinction by a foreground disk, Gonzalez et al. (1998) proposed the
``Synthetic Field Method'' (SFM), which uses the calibrated number of distant
galaxies seen through the foreground disk as a direct indication of extinction.
The method is described in Gonzalez et al. (1998) and Holwerda et al. (2005a).
To obtain good statistics, the method was applied to a set of HST/WFPC2 fields
Holwerda et al. (2005b) and radial extinction profiles were derived, based on
these counts. In the present paper, we explore the relation of opacity with
surface brightness or color from 2MASS images, as well as the relation between
the scalelengths for extinction and light in the I band. We find that there is
indeed a relation between the opacity (A_I) and the surface brightness,
particularly at the higher surface brightnesses. No strong relation between
near infrared (H-J, H-K) color and opacity is found. The scalelengths of the
extinction are uncertain for individual galaxies but seem to indicate that the
dust distribution is much more extended than the stellar light. The results
from the distant galaxy counts are also compared to the reddening derived from
the Cepheids light-curves Freedman et al. (2001). The extinction values are
consistent, provided the selection effect against Cepheids with higher values

in terms of simple luminosity evolution of individual sources, along the lines
discussed by Fanti et al. (1995) and Begelman (1996, 1999), although the
derived parameter values have large uncertainties due to ambiguities in the
selection of GPS sources and to the incompleteness of redshift measurements.
However the simplest self-similar model, whereby the evolution is controlled
only by the radial profile of the density of the ambient medium is not good
enough and one additional parameter needs to be introduced. The fit requires a
decrease of the emitted power and of the peak luminosity with source age or
with decreasing peak frequency, at variance with the Snellen et al. (2000)
model. On the other hand, our analysis confirms the rather flat slope of the
luminosity function, found by Snellen et al. (2000) who also report indications
of a high luminosity break, not required by the data sets we have used. Our
results suggest that the GPS galaxies are the precursors of extended radio

hydrodynamical stellar atmospheres, these formulae provide some broader insight

fluctuations scale inversely proportional to the square root of the number of

simulations with Newtonian gravity and a high resolution shock capturing
scheme, and the quadrupole formula of gravitational radiation. The quark matter
of the mixed phase is described by the MIT bag model and the normal nuclear
matter is described by an ideal fluid equation of state (EOS). 1. We determined
the magnitudes of the emitted gravitational waves for several collapse
scenarios. 2. We determined the types and frequencies of the fluid oscillation
modes excited by the process. In particular, we find that the gravitational
wave signals produced by the collapses are dominated by the fundamental
quadrupole and quasi-radial modes of the final equilibrium configurations. In
some collapse scenarios, we find that the oscillations are damped out within a
few dynamical timescales due to the growth of differential rotations and the
formation of strong shock waves. 3. We showed that the spectrum of the
gravitational wave signals is sensitive to the EOS, implying that the detection
of such gravitational waves could provide useful constraints on the EOS of

separate early-type galaxies on the basis of the slope of their nuclear
brightness profiles, into core and power-law galaxies following the Nuker's
scheme, rather than on the traditional morphological classification (i.e. into
E and S0 galaxies). Our sample of AGN candidates is indistinguishable, when
their brightness profiles are concerned, from galaxies of similar optical
luminosity but hosting weaker (or no) radio-sources. We confirm previous
findings that relatively bright radio-sources (L_r > 10^(21.5) W/Hz) are
uniquely associated to core galaxies. However, below this threshold in
radio-luminosity core and power-law galaxies coexist and they do not show any
apparent difference in their radio-properties. Not surprisingly, since our
sample is deliberately biased to favour the inclusion of active galaxies, we
found a higher fraction of optically nucleated galaxies. Addressing the
multiwavelength properties of these nuclei will be the aim of the two

ULIRGs, QSOs and elliptical galaxies. As a result, we find the following
results; (1) The type I ULIRGs have systematically smaller BH masses in spite
of the comparable bulge luminosity relative to QSOs and elliptical galaxies.
(2) The far-infrared luminosity of most type I ULIRGs is larger than the
Eddington luminosity. We show that above results do not change significantly
for 3 type I ULIRGs that we can estimate the visual extinction from the column
density. Also, for all 8 type I ULIRGs, we investigate the effect of
uncertainties of BH mass measurments and our sample bias, so that it turns out
that our results do not alter even if we consider above two effects. In
addition, Anabuki (2004) revealed that their X-ray properties are similar to
those of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies. These would indicate that active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a high mass accretion rate exist in the type I
ULIRGs. Based on all of these findings, we conclude that it would be a natural
interpretation that type I ULIRGs are the early phase of BH growth, namely the
missing link between ULIRGs and QSOs. Moreover, by comparing our results with a
theoretical model of a coevolution scenario of a QSO BH and a galactic bulge,
we show clearly that this explanation would be valid.

central to cosmological studies that rely on the galaxy cluster gas mass
fraction. Using synthetic observations of numerically simulated clusters viewed
through their X-ray emission and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE), we
reduce the observations to obtain measurements of the cluster gas mass. We are
thus able to quantify the possible sources of uncertainty and systematic bias
associated with the common simplifying assumptions used in reducing real
cluster observations including isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium. We
find that intrinsic variations in clusters limit the precision of observational
gas mass estimation to ~10% to 1 sigma confidence excluding instrumental
effects. Gas mass estimates performed via all methods surprisingly show little
or no trending in the scatter as a function of cluster redshift. For the full
cluster sample, methods that use SZE profiles out to roughly the virial radius
are the simplest, most accurate, and unbiased way to estimate cluster mass.
X-ray methods are systematically more precise mass estimators than are SZE
methods if merger and cool core systems are removed, but X-ray methods slightly
overestimate (5-10%) the cluster gas mass on average. We find that cool core
clusters in our samples are particularly poor candidates for observational mass
estimation, even when excluding emission from the core region. The effects of
cooling in the cluster gas alter the radial profile of the X-ray and SZE
surface brightness outside the cool core region, leading to poor gas mass
estimates in cool core clusters. Finally, we find that methods using a
universal temperature profile estimate cluster masses to higher precision than
those assuming isothermality.

localization transition is studied. Our results show that the classical waves
may follow a different scaling behavior from that for electrons. For electrons,
the effect of weak localization due to interference of recurrent scattering
paths is limited within a spherical volume because of electron-electron or
electron-phonon scattering, while for classical waves, it is the sample
geometry that determine the amount of recurrent scattering paths that
contribute. It is found that the weak localization effect is weaker in both
cubic and slab geometry than in spherical geometry. As a result, the averaged
static diffusion constant D(L) scales like ln(L)/L in cubic or slab geometry
and the corresponding transmission follows <T(L)>~ln L/L^2. This is in contrast
to the behavior of D(L)~1/L and <T(L)>~1/L^2 obtained previously for electrons
or spherical samples. For wave dynamics, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation
in a disordered slab with the recurrent scattering incorporated in a
self-consistent manner. All of the static and dynamic transport quantities
studied are found to follow the scaling behavior of D(L). We have also
considered position-dependent weak localization effects by using a plausible
form of position-dependent diffusion constant D(z). The same scaling behavior

antiferromagnetically and its bond length contracts to 1.72 $\AA$ close to the

the hydrodynamic theory of the Brownian motion (BM) and the Rouse-Zimm (RZ)

Einstein theory of BM. The MSD of the polymer coil is at short times
proportional to t^2 (instead of t). At long times it contains additional (to
the Einstein term) contributions, the leading of which is ~ t^{1/2}. The
relaxation of the internal normal modes of the polymer differs from the
traditional exponential decay. This is displayed in the tails of their
correlation functions, the longest-lived being ~ t^{-3/2} in the Rouse limit
and t^{-5/2} in the Zimm case when the hydrodynamic interaction is strong. It
is discussed that the found peculiarities, in particular a slower diffusion of
the coil, should be observable in dynamic scattering experiments. The dynamic

The SIR is modeled in a multiuser CDMA system with fixed linear receiver and
signature sequences. We show that the power region is convex in linear and
logarithmic scale. It furthermore has a componentwise minimal element. Power
constraints are included by the intersection with the set of all viable power
adjustments.
  In this framework, we aim at minimizing the total expended power by
minimizing a componentwise monotone functional. If the feasible power region is
nonempty, the minimum is attained. Otherwise, as a solution to balance
conflicting interests, we suggest the projection of the minimum point in the
power region onto the set of viable power settings. Finally, with an
appropriate utility function, the problem of minimizing the total expended
power can be seen as finding the Nash bargaining solution, which sheds light on
power assignment from a game theoretic point of view. Convexity and
componentwise monotonicity are essential prerequisites for this result.

paper as the closed string background in type IIA. The idea behind this
construction is that each M^3 might give rise to one large spatial dimension of
4-dimensional spacetime in the closed string sector. In the open string sector,
intersecting D6-branes can be constructed for the simple choice of an
orientifolded M^3=T^3 in a similar way as on the prominent T^6=T^2xT^2xT^2
using exact CFT. The D6-branes then are allowed to span general 2-cycles on
each T^3. The intersection 1-cycles between two stacks of branes on one T^3 can
be understood as one spatial dimension of the effective 4-dimensional
'spacetime' for the massless chiral fermions charged under these two stacks.
Additionally to the known solutions to the R-R tadpole equations conserving
(3+1)-dimensional Poincare invariance, this allows for solutions with globally
just (2+1)- or (1+1)-Poincare invariance. For non-supersymmetric solutions, a
string tree-level and one-loop potential for the scalar moduli (including the
spacetime radii) is generated in the NS-NS sector. This potential here is
interpreted dynamically for radii and dilaton in order to describe the global
evolution of the universe. In the late time picture, (3+1)-dimensional global
Poincare invariance can be restored well within experimental bounds. This
approach links particle properties (the massless chiral fermion spectrum)
directly to the global evolution of the universe by the scalar potential, both
depending on the same topological wrapping numbers. In the future, this might
lead to much better falsifiable phenomenological models.

virtual quanta is created (or destroyed) in of such states. The probability of
creating a quanta in any state is the inverse of the relativistic factor, and
the average number of the quanta making up the ""fur coat"" with a ""seed"" is
equal to this particular factor. The kinetic energy and the relativistic
addition to the particle pulse are interpreted as the average magnitude of the

the equilibrium flow curve the trivial steady state solutions form two

metastable against the formation of synchronized flow for intermediate
densities and unstable for high densities, whereas the lower branch is unstable
for intermediate densities and metastable for high densities. Moreover, the
model can reproduce the typical speed of the downstream front of wide moving
jams. It further reproduces a constant outflow from wide moving jams, which is
far below the maximum free flow. Applying the model to simulate traffic flow at

These are considered epoch-making contributions in the development of ab initio

the multiple-particle Schrodinger equation for atoms and molecules. Before
then, exact solutions had been obtained only for one-electron hydrogenlike
atoms. The helium and hydrogen work was done long before the advent of

computational modeling to show that coupling of signaling with receptor
trafficking results in a highly versatile signal-processing unit, able to sense
by itself absolute levels of ligand, temporal changes in ligand concentration,
and ratios of multiple ligands. This coupling controls whether the response of
the receptor module is transient or permanent and whether or not different

approach unifies seemingly disparate experimental observations and suggests
specific changes in receptor trafficking patterns that can lead to phenotypes

`Cys-loop' superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels which mediate synaptic
neurotransmission, and whose other members include receptors for glycine,
gamma-aminobutyric acid, and serotonin. Cryo-electron microscopy has yielded a
three dimensional structure of the nAChR in its closed state. However, the
exact nature and location of the channel gate remains uncertain. Although the
transmembrane pore is constricted close to its center, it is not completely
occluded. Rather, the pore has a central hydrophobic zone of radius about 3 A.
Model calculations suggest that such a constriction may form a hydrophobic
gate, preventing movement of ions through a channel. We present a detailed and
quantitative simulation study of the hydrophobic gating model of the nicotinic
receptor, in order to fully evaluate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that the
hydrophobic constriction of the nAChR pore indeed forms a closed gate.
Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal that the constriction
presents a barrier of height ca. 10 kT to the permeation of sodium ions,
placing an upper bound on the closed channel conductance of 0.3 pS. Thus, a 3 A
radius hydrophobic pore can form a functional barrier to the permeation of a 1
A radius Na+ ion. Using a united atom force field for the protein instead of an
all atom one retains the qualitative features but results in differing
conductances, showing that the PMF is sensitive to the detailed molecular
interactions.

cycle, its inhibition can control AIDS. The folding of single domain proteins,
like each of the monomers forming the HIV-1-PR homodimer, is controlled by
local elementary structures (LES, folding units stabilized by strongly
interacting, highly conserved, as a rule hydrophobic, amino acids). These LES
have evolved over myriad of generations to recognize and strongly attract each
other, so as to make the protein fold fast and be stable in its native
conformation. Consequently, peptides displaying a sequence identical to those
segments of the monomers associated with LES are expected to act as competitive
inhibitors and thus destabilize the native structure of the enzyme. These
inhibitors are unlikely to lead to escape mutants as they bind to the protease
monomers through highly conserved amino acids which play an essential role in
the folding process. The properties of one of the most promising inhibitors of
the folding of the HIV-1-PR monomers found among these peptides is demonstrated
with the help of spectrophotometric assays and CD spectroscopy.

trapping mechanism known from micro-maser theory, this mechanism works also in
an incoherent regime operated by noisy lasers and is therefore much more robust
against external decoherence effects. These features favour the incoherent
regime, in particular for the preparation of highly excited trapping states.
