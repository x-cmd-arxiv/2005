between a subgiant or slightly evolved red-giant star and a neutron star (NS).
Such collisions are likely to form ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) observed
today in old globular clusters. In particular, we compute collisions of a 1.4
Msun NS with realistically modelled parent stars of initial masses 0.8 and 0.9
Msun, each at three different evolutionary stages (corresponding to three
different radii R). The distance of closest approach for the initial orbit
varies from 0.04 R (nearly head-on) to 1.3 R (grazing). These collisions lead
to the formation of a tight binary, composed of the NS and the subgiant or
red-giant core, embedded in an extremely diffuse common envelope (CE) typically
of mass ~0.1 to 0.3 Msun. Our calculations follow the binary for many hundreds
of orbits, ensuring that the orbital parameters we determine at the end of the
calculations are close to final. Some of the fluid initially in the envelope of
the (sub)giant, from 0.003 to 0.023 Msun in the cases we considered, is left
bound to the NS. The eccentricities of the resulting binaries range from about
0.2 for our most grazing collision to about 0.9 for the nearly head-on cases.
In almost all the cases we consider, gravitational radiation alone will cause
sufficiently fast orbital decay to form a UCXB within a Hubble time, and often
on a much shorter timescale. Our hydrodynamics code implements the recent SPH
equations of motion derived with a variational approach by Springel & Hernquist
and by Monaghan. Numerical noise is reduced by enforcing an analytic constraint
equation that relates the smoothing lengths and densities of SPH particles. We
present tests of these new methods to help demonstrate their improved accuracy.

forms large scale filamentary structure. Although the galaxies are expected to
emit numerous Lya photons, they are surrounded by plentiful neutral hydrogen
with a typical optical depth for Lya of ~10^5 (HI halos) before the era of
cosmological reionization. The HI halo almost follows the cosmological Hubble
expansion with some anisotropic corrections around the galaxy because of the
gravitational attraction by the underlying CDM filament. In this paper, we
investigate the detectability of the Lya emissions from the first galaxies,
examining their dependence on viewing angles. Solving the Lya line transfer
problem in an anisotropically expanding HI halo, we show that the escape
probability from the HI halo is the largest in direction along the filament
axis. If the Lya source is observed with a narrow-band filter, the difference
of apparent Lya line luminosities among viewing angles can be a factor of > 40
at an extreme case. Furthermore, we evaluate the predicted physical features of
the Lya sources and flux magnification by gravitational lensing effect due to
clusters of galaxies along the filament. We conclude that, by using the next
generation space telescopes like the JWST, the Lya emissions from the first
galaxies whose CDM filament axes almost face to us can be detected with the S/N

outbursts of 4U 1630-47, and most of the data recorded typical features of the
high/soft states. We found that the spectra in the high/soft states can be
further classified into three states. The first spectral state is explained by
a concept of the standard accretion disk picture. The second state appears in
the so-called very high state, where a dominant hard component is seen and the
disk radius apparently becomes too small. These phenomena are explained by the
effect of inverse Compton scattering of disk photons, as shown by Kubota,
Makishima, & Ebisawa (2001, ApJ, 560, L147) for GRO J1655-40. The third state
is characterized in such a way that the disk luminosity varies in proportion to
$T_{\rm in}^2$, rather than $T_{\rm in}^4$, where $T_{\rm in}$ is the
inner-disk temperature. This state is suggested to be an optically-thick and
advection-dominated slim disk, as suggested by Kubota & Makishima (2004, ApJ,
601, 428) for XTE J1550-564. The second and third states appear, with good
reproducibility, when $T_{\rm in}$ and the total X-ray luminosity are higher
than 1.2 keV and $\sim2.5\times10^{38}(D/10\quad{\rm kpc})^2\l
eft[\cos{\theta}/(1/\sqrt{3})]^{-1}$ erg s$^{-1}$, respectively, where $D$ is

the {\it Chandra} archival X-ray data. In X-ray luminous galaxies, a
temperature increases with radius and a gas density is systematically higher at
the optical outskirts, indicating a presence of a significant amount of the
group-scale hot gas. In contrast, X-ray dim galaxies show a flat or declining
temperature profile against radius and the gas density is relatively lower at
the optical outskirts. Thus it is found that X-ray bright and faint elliptical
galaxies are clearly distinguished by the temperature and gas density profile.
The mass profile is well scaled by a virial radius $r_{200}$ rather than an
optical-half radius $r_e$, and is quite similar at $(0.001-0.03)r_{200}$
between X-ray luminous and dim galaxies, and smoothly connects to those of
clusters of galaxies. At the inner region of $(0.001-0.01)r_{200}$ or
$(0.1-1)r_e$, the mass profile well traces a stellar mass with a constant
mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_{\rm B}=3-10(M_{\odot}/L_{\odot})$. $M/L_{\rm B}$
ratio of X-ray bright galaxies rises up steeply beyond $0.01r_{200}$, and thus
requires a presence of massive dark matter halo. From the deprojection analysis
combined with the {\it XMM-Newton} data, we found that X-ray dim galaxies, NGC
3923, NGC 720, and IC 1459, also have a high $M/L_{\rm B}$ ratio of 20--30 at
20 kpc, comparable to that of X-ray luminous galaxies. Therefore, dark matter
is indicated to be common in elliptical galaxies, and their distribution almost
follows the NFW profile, as well as galaxy clusters.

elliptical galaxies formed from a sequence of major dissipationless galaxy
merging. We find that the radial density profiles of GCSs in elliptical

as power-laws with slopes (${\alpha}_{\rm gc}$) ranging from -2.0 to -1.0. They
are flatter than, and linearly proportional to, the slopes (${\alpha}_{\rm s}$)
of the stellar density profiles of their host galaxies. We also find that the
GCS core radii ($r_{\rm c}$) of the density profiles are larger in ellipticals
that experienced more mergers. By applying a reasonable scaling relation
between luminosities and sizes of galaxies to the simulation results, we show
that ${\alpha}_{\rm gc} \approx -0.36 M_{\rm V}-9.2$, $r_{\rm c} \approx -1.85

  Structure","accepted in WINE2005, Hong Kong, December 15-17, 2005",,,,"cs.NI cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph",,"  A sharing community prospers when participation and contribution are both
high. We suggest the two, while being related decisions every peer makes,
should be given separate rational bases. Considered as such, a basic issue is
the viability of club formation, which necessitates the modelling of two major
sources of heterogeneity, namely, peers and shared content. This viability
perspective clearly explains why rational peers contribute (or free-ride when
they don't) and how their collective action determines viability as well as the
size of the club formed. It also exposes another fundamental source of
limitation to club formation apart from free-riding, in the community structure
in terms of the relation between peers' interest (demand) and sharing (supply).

implications of a decay law for $\Lambda$ term that is proportional to $\beta
\frac{\ddot {a}}{a}$, where $\beta$ is a constant and $a$ is the scale factor
of RW-space time. We discuss the cosmological consequences of a model for the
vanishing pressure for the case $k=0$. It has been observed that such models
are compatible with the result of recent observations and cosmological term
$\Lambda$ gradually reduces as the universe expands. In this model $\Lambda$
varies as the inverse square of time, which matches its natural units. The
proper distance, the luminosity distance-redshift, the angular diameter
distance-redshift, and look back time-redshift for the model are presented in
the frame work of higher dimensional space time. The model of the Freese {\it
et al.} ({\it Nucl. Phys. B} {\bf 287}, 797 (1987)) for $n=2$ is retrieved for
the particular choice of $A_{0}$ and also Einstein-de Sitter model is obtained
for $A_{0} = {2/3}$. This work has thus generalized to higher dimensions the
well-know result in four dimensional space time. It is found that there may be
significant difference in principle at least, from the analogous situation in
four dimensional space time.

the power counting for higher orders. The requirement of a three-body force for
renormalization of the three-nucleon system explains the previously observed
correlation between the triton binding energy and charge radius for different
model potentials.

Pollock paintings are calculated using a filtering process which models
perceptual response to color differences ($\Lab$ color space). The advantage of
the $\Lab$ space filtering method over traditional RGB spaces is that the
former is a perceptually-uniform (metric) space, leading to a more consistent
definition of ``perceptually different'' colors. It is determined that the RGB
filtering method underestimates the perceived fractal dimension of lighter
colored patterns but not of darker ones, if the same selection criteria is
applied to each. Implications of the findings to Fechner's 'Principle of the
Aesthetic Middle' and Berlyne's work on perception of complexity are discussed.

  Channel: Stability and Resolution",,"Nonlinearity 19 (2006) 2425-2439.",,,"physics.class-ph",,"  We analyze the time reversal of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
system in a space-frequency-selective multi-path fading channel described by
the stochastic Schr\""odinger equation with a random potential in the
strong-fluctuation regime. We prove that in a broadband limit the conditions
for stable super-resolution are the {\em packing} condition that the spacing
among the $N$ transmitters and $M$ receivers be more than the coherence length
$\ell_c$ and the consecutive symbols in the data-streams are separated by more
than the inverse of the bandwidth $B^{-1}$ and the {\em multiplexing} condition
that the number of the degrees of freedom per unit time at the transmitters
($\sim NB$) be much larger than the number of the degrees of freedom ($\sim
MC$) per unit time in the ensemble of intended messages. Here $C$ is the number
of symbols per unit time in the data-streams intended for each receiver. When
the two conditions are met, all receivers receive simultaneously streams of
statistically stable, sharply focused signals intended for them, free of fading
and interference. This indicates the rough multiplexing gain of $NB$ in channel
capacity, with the maximal gain per unit {\em angular} cross section given by
$BL^d \ell_c^{-d}$ where $L$ is the distance from the transmitters to the
receivers. We show that under the ideal packing condition time reversal can
result in a high signal-to-interference ratio and low probability of intercept,
and hence is an effective means for achieving the information capacity of
multi-path channels in the presence of multiple users (receivers).

  distinction between quantal and nonquantal uncertainties","Unabridged Latex version of a 1981 MIT doctoral thesis. Published on
  the ArXiv with explicit written permission of the Massachusetts Institute of
  Technology. Work referred to in a series of articles listed in the Foreword.
  64 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A general quantum theory encompassing Mechanics, Thermodynamics and
irreversible dynamics is presented in two parts. The first part is concerned
exclusively with the description of the states of any individual physical
system. It is based on a new nonlinear quantum equation of motion, which
reduces to the Schroedinger equation of motion of motion of conventional
quantum dynamics only under special conditions. It accounts for the
implications of the laws of Thermodynamics as well as for irreversible
phenomena, such as the natural tendency of an isolated system to transit from
any non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state of higher entropy.
Conversely, the laws of Thermodynamics and irreversibility emerge as
manifestations of the fundamental quantum dynamical behaviour of the elementary
constituents of any material system. We call this part Quantum Thermodynamics.
The second part of the theory, which contains the first as a special case, is
concerned with the description of stochastic distributions of states in an
ensemble of identical physical systems each of which individually obeys the
laws of Quantum Thermodynamics. It is based on a new measure-theoretic
description of ensembles. It accounts unambiguously for the essential
distinction between two types of uncertainties that are generally present in an
ensemble, namely, quantal uncertainties due to the inherent quantal nature of
the states of each individual member system and nonquantal uncertainties due to
the stochastic distribution of states. We call this part Quantum Statistical
Thermodynamics.

computations. Interest in quantum computing has been sparked by both the
realization that increasing miniaturisation will eventually bring computer
scientists face-to-face with quantum effects, and by the grasping of the
potential for massive parallelism inherent in the Hilbert space representation
of quantum systems and in the special effects of quantum entanglement.

Rayleigh-fading channels with $N$ inputs (transmitters) and $M$ outputs
(receivers).
  The main issues addressed are the condition of statistical stability, the
rate of information transfer and the effect of pinholes. The stability
condition is proved to be $MC\ll N_{\rm eff}B$ for broadband channels and $M\ll
N_{\rm eff}$ for narrowband channels where $C$ is the symbol rate, $B$ is the
bandwidth and $N_{\rm eff}$ is the {\em effective} number of transmitters. It
is shown that when the number of layers, $n-1$, is relatively low compared to
the logarithm of numbers of pinholes $N_{\rm eff}$ is given by $n^{-1}$ times
the harmonic mean of the number of transmitters and the numbers of pinholes at
all layers. On the other hand, when the number of layers is relatively large
the effective number of pinholes diminishes exponentially. The energy
efficiency is shown to be optimal when the power supply is set to the noise
level times $BN_{\rm eff}$ and that the maximal information rate is roughly
$BN_{\rm eff}$ when the stability condition is violated.
