groups (18 sources), there are no confirmed type I bursts in 6.5 Ms of

produce the 511 keV line. We propose that there may exist three possible
scenarios of pulsar winds as the positron sources: normal pulsars; rapidly
spinning strongly magnetized neutron stars in GRB progenitors; a population of
millisecond pulsars in the Galactic center region. These $e^\pm$pairs could be
trapped in the region by the magnetic field in the GC, and cool through the
synchrotron radiation and Coulomb interactions with the medium. The cooling
timescales are lower than the diffuse timescale of positrons, so low energy
positrons could annihilate directly with electrons into 511 keV photons or form
positronium before annihilation. We find that normal pulsars cannot be a
significant contributor to the positron sources. Although magnetars in the GC
could be potential sources of positrons, their birth rate and birth locations
may impose some problems for this scenario. We believe that the most likely
candidate positron sources in the GC may be a population of millisecond pulsars
in the GC. Our preliminary estimations predict the e$^\pm$ annihilation rate in
the GC is $> 5\times 10^{42}$ s$^{-1}$. Therefore, the $e^\pm$ pairs from
pulsars winds can contribute significantly to the positron sources in the GC.
Furthermore, since the diffusion length of positrons is short, we predict that
the intensity distribution of the annihilation line should follow the
distribution of millisecond pulsars, which should correlate to the mass
distribution in the GC.

stalled. We take an experimental stand point in this paper. Using spherically
symmetric, completely steady, shocked accretion flows as unperturbed states, we
have clearly observed both the linear growth and the subsequent nonlinear
saturation of the instability. In so doing, we have employed a realistic
equation of state together with heating and cooling via neutrino reactions with
nucleons. We have done a mode analysis based on the spherical harmonics
decomposition and found that the modes with l=1, 2 are dominant not only in the
linear regime, but also after the nonlinear couplings generate various modes
and the saturation occurs. Varying the neutrino luminosity, we have constructed
the unperturbed states both with and without a negative entropy-gradient. We
have found that in both cases the growth of the instability is similar,
suggesting the convection does not play a dominant role, which also appears to
be supported by the recent linear analysis of the convection in accretion flows
by Foglizzo et al. The real part of the eigen frequency seems to be mainly
determined by the advection time rather than by the sound-crossing time.
Whatever the cause may be, the instability is favorable for the shock revival.

reach, and extend this discussion to consider future large aperture telescopes
with cryogenically cooled adaptive reimaging optics. In particular, we simulate
observations of spectral line emission from star-forming regions at redshifts z
= 0.5 to 2.5 using a variety of spatial sampling scales and give predictions
for the signal-to-noise ratio expected as a function of redshift. Using values
characteristic of the W.M. Keck II telescope and the new OH-Suppressing
InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS) we calculate integral-field
signal-to-noise ratio maps for a sample of U_nGR color-selected star-forming
galaxies at redshift z ~ 2 - 2.6 and demonstrate that OSIRIS will be able to
reconstruct the two-dimensional projected velocity fields of these galaxies on
scales of 100 mas (~ 1 kpc at redshift z ~ 2). With signal-to-noise ratios per
spatial sample up to ~ 20, OSIRIS will in some cases be able to distinguish
between merger activity and ordered disk rotation. Structures on scales smaller
than 1 kpc may be detected by OSIRIS for particularly bright sources, and will
be easy targets for future 30m class telescopes.

$\ga 10^4$K at different times, their temperatures evolve as the ionized
intergalactic medium (IGM) expands. The varying IGM temperature makes the
minimum mass of galaxies spatially non-uniform with a fluctuation amplitude
that increases towards small scales. These scale-dependent fluctuations modify
the shape of the power spectrum of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts in a way
that depends on the history of reionization. The resulting distortion of the
primordial power spectrum is significantly larger than changes associated with
uncertainties in the inflationary parameters, such as the spectral index of the

jets. Based on the formulae, we first quantify the spectrum of GWs from a

carbon-enhanced, metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < -2.0 that exhibit strong
enhancements of s-process elements. These stars are believed to be the result
of a binary mass-transfer episode from a former asymptotic giant-branch (AGB)
companion that underwent s-process nucleosynthesis. However, several such stars
exhibit significantly lower Ba/Eu ratios than solar s-process abundances. This
might be explained if there were an additional contribution from the r-process,
thereby diluting the Ba/Eu ratio by extra production of Eu. We propose a model
in which the double enhancements of r-process and s-process elements originate
from a former 8-10 M_\odot companion in a wide binary system, which may undergo
s-processing during an AGB phase, followed by r-processing during its
subsequent supernova explosion. The mass of Eu (as representative of r-process
elements) captured by the secondary through the wind from the supernova is
estimated, which is assumed to be proportional to the geometric fraction of the
secondary (low-mass, main-sequence) star with respect to the primary
(exploding) star. We find that the estimated mass is in good agreement with a
constraint on the Eu yield per supernova event obtained from a Galactic
chemical evolution study, when the initial orbital separation is taken to be
\sim 1 year. If one assumes an orbital period on the order of five years, the
efficiency of wind pollution from the supernova must be enhanced by a factor of
\sim 10. This may, in fact, be realized if the expansion velocity of the
supernova's innermost ejecta, in which the r-process has taken place, is
significantly slow, resulting in an enhancement of accretion efficiency by
gravitational focusing.

star and brown dwarf theory.(1) We first focus on the mechanical (equation of
state) and thermal (atmosphere) properties and on the evolution. We then
examine the current shortcomings of the theory and we discuss recent
observational analysis which have suggested discrepancies between models and
observations.(2) We then examine the stellar and brown dwarf IMF and suggest
that a power-law above the average thermal Jeans mass (about 1 Msol) rolling
over a lognormal form below this limit adequately reproduces the observations
of field and young cluster stellar and brown dwarf distributions. This yields a
reasonably accurate estimate of the stellar and brown dwarf Galactic census.
Finally (3) we argue that the combination of turbulence driven fragmentation at
large scale and gravity at small scales provides an appealing solution for the
general star and brown dwarf formation mechanism. It also provides a physical
ground for the aforementioned power-law + lognormal form for the IMF, whereas a
series of different power laws lacks such a physical motivation. At last, we
argue that the deuterium-burning limit as the distinction between stars and
planets has no physical foundation in this modern star formation scheme.
Opacity limited fragmentation extending down to a few (< 10) jupiter masses,
due to shocks, anisotropy or magnetic fields, provides a much more robust
limit, even though difficult to determine accurately. Therefore, the various
""direct"" detections of exoplanets claimed recently in the literature are most
likely regular low-mass brown dwarfs and the direct detection of an extrasolar
planet remains for now elusive.

  comments","Astrophys.J.649:640-648,2006","10.1086/506263",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the redshift dependence of X-ray cluster scaling relations
drawn from three hydrodynamic simulations of the LCDM cosmology: a Radiative
model that incorporates radiative cooling of the gas, a Preheating model that
additionally heats the gas uniformly at high redshift, and a Feedback model
that self-consistently heats cold gas in proportion to its local star-formation
rate. While all three models are capable of reproducing the observed local
Lx-Tx relation, they predict substantially different results at high redshift
(to z=1.5), with the Radiative, Preheating and Feedback models predicting
strongly positive, mildly positive and mildly negative evolution, respectively.
  The physical explanation for these differences lies in the structure of the
intracluster medium. All three models predict significant temperature
fluctuations at any given radius due to the presence of cool subclumps and, in
the case of the Feedback simulation, reheated gas. The mean gas temperature
lies above the dynamical temperature of the halo for all models at z=0, but
differs between models at higher redshift with the Radiative model having the
lowest mean gas temperature at z=1.5.
  We have not attempted to model the scaling relations in a manner that mimics
the observational selection effects, nor has a consistent observational picture
yet emerged. Nevertheless, evolution of the scaling relations promises to be a
powerful probe of the physics of entropy generation in clusters. First
indications are that early, widespread heating is favored over an extended
period of heating that is associated with galaxy formation.

database and in recently published papers to derive properties related to the
disk structure. The sample totals 654 OCs, consisting basically of Trumpler
types I to III clusters. Because of the completeness effects, the observed
radial distribution of OCs with respect to Galactocentric distance does not
follow the expected exponential profile. We simulate the effects of
completeness assuming that the observed distribution of the number of OCs with
a given number of stars above the background, measured in a restricted zone
outside the Solar circle, is representative of the intrinsic distribution of
OCs throughout the Galaxy. As a result we derive completeness-corrected radial
distributions which agree with exponential disks throughout the observed
Galactocentric distance range 5--14\,kpc, with scale lengths in the range $1.5
- 1.9\,kpc$. In particular we retrieve the expected exponential-disk radial
profile for the highly depleted regions internal to the Solar circle.
Extrapolation of the completeness-corrected radial distributions down to the
Galactic center indicates a total number of OCs in the range $\rm(1.8 -
3.7)\times10^5$. These estimates are upper-limits because they do not take into
account depletion in the number of OCs by dynamical effects in the inner parts
of the Galaxy. The observed and completeness-corrected age-distributions of the
OCs can be fitted by a combination of two exponential-decay profiles
characterized by age scales of $\rm\sim100\,Myr$ and $\rm\sim1.9\,Gyr$,
respectively. This rules out evolutionary scenarios based on constant
star-formation and OC-disruption rates. We estimate that 3.4--8\% of the
embedded clusters do actually emerge from the parent molecular clouds as OCs.

Reddening variation throughout the cluster region is taken into account

decontamination showed that the lower limit of the main sequence (MS) occurs at
$\rm\approx5\,\ms$. Based on the fraction of Ks excess stars in the
colour-colour diagram we estimate an age of $1.3\pm0.3$\,Myr which is
consistent with the presence of a large number of pre-main sequence (PMS)
stars. The radial density distribution including MS and PMS stars is fitted by
a King profile with a core radius $0.70\pm0.08\,pc$. The cluster density
profile merges into the background at a limiting radius $6.5\pm0.5\,pc$. In the
halo and through the whole cluster the MFs have slopes $\rm\chi=1.52\pm0.13$
and $\rm\chi=1.45\pm0.12$, respectively, thus slightly steeper than Salpeter's
IMF. In the core the MF is flat, $\rm\chi=0.62\pm0.16$, indicating some degree
of mass segregation since the cluster age is a factor $\sim2$ larger than the
relaxation time. Because of the very young age of NGC\,6611, part of this
effect appears to be related to the molecular cloud-fragmentation process
itself. We detect $362\pm120$ PMS stars. The total observed mass including
detected MS (in the range $\rm5-85\,\ms$) and PMS stars amounts to
$\sim1\,600\,\ms$, thus more massive than the Trapezium cluster. Compared to
older open clusters of different masses, the overall NGC\,6611 fits in the
relations involving structural and dynamical parameters. However, the core is
atypical in the sense that it looks like an old/dynamically evolved core.
Again, part of this effect must be linked to formation processes.

galactic spiral shock and the subsequent formation of giant molecular clouds
(GMCs). The spiral shock forms dense clouds while dissipating kinetic energy,
producing regions that are locally gravitationally bound and collapse to form
stars. The effect of the clumpiness of gas as it passes through the shock is to
generate chaotic internal motions in the gas. The kinematics of these motions
are found to agree with the observed velocity-dispersion/size relation found in
star-forming regions. In contrast to the standard picture where continuously
driven turbulence generates the density inhomogeneities in star-forming clouds,
we find here that it is the clumpiness of the interstellar gas that produces
the chaotic motions as it passes through the spiral shock and initiates the
star formation process. The velocity dispersion can be understood as being due
to the random mass loading of clumps as they converge in the spiral shock. In
this model there is no need for any internal or external continuous driving
mechanism for the 'turbulence'. The coupling of the clouds' internal kinematics
to their externally triggered formation removes the need for the clouds to be
self-gravitating. Indeed, while clearly some parts of the clouds are
self-gravitating and able to form stars, most of the molecular material remains
gravitationally unbound. This can provide a simple explanation for the low
efficiency of star formation.

a one dimensional fluctuating interface, which in a special case can be mapped
to the problem of a passive scalar advected by a Burgers fluid. Driven by the
surface fluctuations, the particles show a tendency to cluster, but the
hard-core interaction prevents collapse. We use numerical simulations to
measure the auto-correlation function in steady state and in the aging regime,
and space-time correlation functions in steady state. We have also calculated
these quantities analytically in a related surface model. The steady state
auto-correlation is a scaling function of t/L^z, where L is the system size and
z the dynamic exponent. Starting from a finite intercept, the scaling function
decays with a cusp, in the small argument limit. The finite value of the
intercept indicates the existence of long range order in the system. The
space-time correlation, which is a function of r/L and t/L^z, is non-monotonic
in t for fixed r. The aging auto-correlation is a scaling function of t_1 and
t_2 where t_1 is the waiting time and t_2 the time difference. This scaling
function decays as a power law for t_2 \gg t_1; for t_1 \gg t_2, it decays with
a cusp as in steady state. To reconcile the occurrence of strong fluctuations
in the steady state with the fact of an ordered state, we measured the
distribution function of the length of the largest cluster. This shows that
fluctuations never destroy ordering, but rather the system meanders from one
ordered configuration to another on a relatively rapid time scale.

finite-size-scaling analysis of the results of high-precision Monte Carlo
simulations on square lattices L x L, up to L=O(10^3).
  In the FFXY model and in the other models, when the transitions are
continuous, there are two very close but separate transitions. There is an
Ising chiral transition characterized by the onset of chiral long-range order
while spins remain paramagnetic. Then, as temperature decreases, the systems
undergo a Kosterlitz-Thouless spin transition to a phase with quasi-long-range
order.
  The FFXY model and the other models in a rather large parameter region show a
crossover behavior at the chiral and spin transitions that is universal to some
extent. We conjecture that this universal behavior is due to a multicritical
point. The numerical data suggest that the relevant multicritical point is a
zero-temperature transition. A possible candidate is the O(4) point that

such link adaption is performed by pulse shaping, i.e. by properly adjusting
the transmit and receive filters. For example pulse shaped Offset--QAM systems
have been recently shown to have superior performance over standard cyclic
prefix OFDM (while operating at higher spectral efficiency).In this paper we
establish a general mathematical framework for joint transmitter and receiver

respect to the scattering function of the WSSUS channel. In our framework the
pulse shape optimization problem is translated to an optimization problem over
trace class operators which in turn is related to fidelity optimization in

be equivalent to a \emph{convex constraint quasi-convex maximization problem}

In particular, we derive the joint probability distribution of eigenvalues of
the matrix GG*, with G a semicorrelated Gaussian random matrix or a Gaussian
random matrix with a non-zero mean (and G* its hermitian conjugate) . These
joint probability distribution functions can then be used to calculate the
moment generating function of the mutual information for Gaussian channels with
multiple antennas on both ends with this probability distribution of their
channel matrices G. We then turn to the previously unsolved problem of
calculating the moment generating function of the mutual information of MIMO
(multiple input-multiple output) channels, which are correlated at both the
receiver and the transmitter. From this moment generating function we obtain
the ergodic average of the mutual information and study the outage probability.
These methods can be applied to a number of other problems. As a particular

the nature of gravity and gives possibility to construct new cosmological
models in Minkowski space. According to FG, the universal gravity force is
caused by exchange of gravitons - the quanta of gravity field. Energy of this
field is well-defined and excludes the singularity. All classical relativistic
effects are the same as in GR, though there are new effects, such as free fall
of rotating bodies, scalar gravitational radiation, surface of relativistic
compact bodies, which may be tested experimentally. The intrinsic scalar (spin
0) part of gravity field corresponds to ""antigravity"" and only together with
the pure tensor (spin 2) part gives the usual Newtonian force. Laboratory and
astrophysical experiments for testing new predictions of FG, will be performed

The basic idea is to start from a {\it twisted} formulation of the underlying

a twisted algebra which contains a scalar nilpotent supercharge $Q$.
Furthermore the action of the theory can then be written as the $Q$-variation
of some function. The case of ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory in two
dimensions is discussed in some detail. We then present our proposal for
discretizing this theory and derive the resultant lattice action. The latter is
local, free of spectrum doubling, gauge invariant and preserves the scalar
supercharge invariance exactly. Some preliminary numerical results are then
presented. The approach can be naturally generalized to yield a lattice action
for ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions.

obtained formula has the correct limits. Nuclear effects, evaluated by a modern

short range three-body interaction, with a coupling that is governed by a
precisely mapped limit cycle of the renormalization group. Additional
three-body irrelevant interactions must be determined to control subleading

theory since the continuum limit is not likely to match physical systems ({\it

to unequal rates of mutation between the bases. The frequencies of bases at
four-fold degenerate sites respond directly to mutation pressure. At 1st and
2nd positions, selection reduces the degree of frequency variation. Using a
simple evolutionary model, we show that 1st position sites are less constrained
by selection than 2nd position sites, and therefore that the frequencies of
bases at 1st position are more responsive to mutation pressure than those at
2nd position. We define a similarity measure between amino acids that is a
function of 8 measured physical properties. We define a proximity measure for
each amino acid, which is the average similarity between an amino acid and all
others that are accessible via single point mutations in the genetic code. We
also define a responsiveness for each amino acid, which measures how rapidly an
amino acid frequency changes as a result of mutation pressure acting on the
base frequencies. There is a strong correlation between responsiveness and
proximity, and both these quantities are also correlated with the mutability of
amino acids estimated from the mtREV substitution rate matrix. We also consider
the variation of base frequencies between strands and between genes on a

long-distance fiber-optic quantum key distribution. The photon pairs were
generated in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide with a high
conversion-efficiency. Using a pulsed semiconductor laser with a pulse rate of
800 kHz and a maximum average pump power of 50 muW, we obtained a coincidence
rate of 600 s^-1. Our measurements are in agreement with a Poissonian
photon-pair distribution, as is expected from a comparison of the coherence
time of the pump and of the detected photons. An average of 0.9 photon pairs
per pulse was obtained.

Phys. J. D 37, 451 (2006)","10.1140/epjd/e2005-00315-2",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a scheme for the construction of a CNOT gate by adiabatic passage
in an optical cavity. In opposition to a previously proposed method, the
technique is not based on fractional adiabatic passage, which requires the
control of the ratio of two pulse amplitudes. Moreover, the technique
constitutes a decoherence-free method in the sense that spontaneous emission
and cavity damping are avoided since the dynamics follows dark states.

the spatial dispersion of their response functions. We employ model-independent
expressions for the force in terms of the optical coefficients. We express the
non-local corrections to the Fresnel coefficients employing the surface
$d_\perp$ parameter, which accounts for the distribution of the surface
screening charge. Within a self-consistent jellium calculation, spatial
dispersion increases the Casimir force significatively for small separations.
The nonlocal correction has the opposite sign than previously predicted
employing hydrodynamic models and assuming abruptly terminated surfaces.
