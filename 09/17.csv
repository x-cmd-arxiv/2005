and clusters in the nearby Universe. The study is based on the UZC and SSRS2
group catalogs and peculiar velocity samples. We find a clear signature of
infall of galaxies onto groups over a wide range of scales 5 h^{-1} Mpc<r<30
h^{-1} Mpc, with an infall amplitude on the order of a few hundred kilometers
per second. We obtain a significant increase in the infall amplitude with group
virial mass (M_{V}) and luminosity of group member galaxies (L_{g}). Groups
with M_{V}<10^{13} M_{\odot} show infall velocities V_{infall} \simeq 150 km
s^{-1} whereas for M_{V}>10^{13} M_{\odot} a larger infall is observed,
V_{infall} \simeq 200 km s^{-1}. Similarly, we find that galaxies surrounding
groups with L_{g}<10^{15} L_{\odot} have V_{infall} \simeq 100 km s^{-1},
whereas for L_{g}>10^{15} L_{\odot} groups, the amplitude of the galaxy infall
can be as large as V_{infall} \simeq 250 km s^{-1}. The observational results
are compared with the results obtained from mock group and galaxy samples
constructed from numerical simulations, which include galaxy formation through
semianalytical models. We obtain a general agreement between the results from
the mock catalogs and the observations. The infall of galaxies onto groups is
suitably reproduced in the simulations and, as in the observations, larger
virial mass and luminosity groups exhibit the largest galaxy infall amplitudes.
We derive estimates of the integrated mass overdensities associated with groups
by applying linear theory to the infall velocities after correcting for the
effects of distance uncertainties obtained using the mock catalogs. The
resulting overdensities are consistent with a power law with \delta \sim 1 at r
\sim 10 h^{-1}Mpc.

consisted of 25 HST/STIS echelle quasar spectra (R = 45,000) which covered SiII
1260 and CII 1335 over this redshift range. Using those similar transitions as
tracers of MgII facilitates a much larger survey, covering a redshift
pathlength of g(z) = 5.3 for an equivalent width limit of MgII corresponding to
W(2796) > 0.02 A, with 30% completeness for the weakest lines. We find the
number of weak MgII absorber analogs with 0.02 < W(2796) < 0.3 to be dN/dz =
1.00 +/- 0.20 for 0 < z < 0.3. This value is consistent with cosmological
evolution of the population. We consider the expected effect on observability
of weak MgII absorbers of the decreasing intensity of the extragalactic
background radiation eld from z~1 to z~0. Assuming that all the objects that
produce absorption at z~1 are stable on a cosmological timescale, and that no
new objects are created, we would expect dN/dz of 2-3 at z~0. About 30-50% of
this z~0 population would be decendants of the parsec-scale structures that
produce single-cloud, weak MgII absorbers at z~1. The other 50-70% would be
lower density, kiloparsec-scale structures that produce CIV absorption, but not
detectable low ionization absorption, at z~1. We conclude that at least one,
and perhaps some fraction of both, of these populations has evolved away since
z~1, in order to match the z~0 dN/dz measured in our survey. This would follow
naturally for a population of transient structures whose generation is related
to star-forming processes, whose rate has decreased since z~1.

multiphase model for star formation and supernova feedback. Additionally, we
incorporate a periodic heating mechanism in the form of hot, buoyant bubbles,
injected into the intragalactic medium (IGM) during the active phases of the
accreting central AGN. We use simulations of isolated cluster halos of
different masses to study the bubble dynamics and the heat transport into the

explore a variety of different assumptions for the spatial configuration of
AGN-driven bubbles, for their duty cycles and for the energy injection

both the stellar and gaseous components of clusters of galaxies. Most
importantly, it alters the properties of the central dominant (cD) galaxy by
reducing the mass deposition rate of freshly cooled gas out of the ICM, thereby
offering an energetically plausible solution to the cooling flow problem. At
the same time, this leads to reduced or eliminated star formation in the
central cD galaxy, giving it red stellar colours as observed.

the dead zone is expected to be of the order of terrestrial and ice giant mass
planets while that outside the dead zone is Jovian or super-Jovian mass
planets, largely independent of the star-forming environment. We show that dead
zones can significantly slow down both type I and type II planetary migration
due to their lower viscosity. We also find that the growth of eccentricity of
massive extrasolar planets is particularly favorable through the planet-disk
interaction inside the dead zones due to the large gaps expected to be opened
by planets.

relevant to cosmology: Was there a decelerating past for the universe? To
answer this, the Bayes's probability theory is employed, which is the most
appropriate tool for quantifying our knowledge when it changes through the
acquisition of new data. The cosmographic approach helps to sort out models
which were always accelerating from those which decelerated for at least some

anisotropic bonds properties. The puckering of the sheet is explained as a
mechanism to stabilize the sp sigma bonds. The anisotropic bond properties of
the boron sheet lead to a two-dimensional reference lattice structure, which is
rectangular rather than triangular. As a consequence the chiral angles of
related boron nanotubes range from 0 to 90 degrees. Given the electronic
properties of the boron sheets, we demonstrate that all of the related boron

also postulate the existence of helical currents in ideal chiral nanotubes.

explanation for the LSND signal for \bar\nu_mu to \bar\nu_e oscillations. We
first point out that all positive oscillation signals occur in matter and that
three active mass-varying neutrinos are insufficient to describe all existing
neutrino data including LSND. We then examine the possibility that a model with
four mass-varying neutrinos (three active and one sterile) can explain the LSND
effect and remain consistent with all other neutrino data. We find that such
models with a 3+1 mass structure in the neutrino sector may explain the LSND
data and a null MiniBooNE result for 0.10 < \sin^2 2\theta_x < 0.30.
Predictions of the model include a null result at Double-CHOOZ, but positive
signals for underground reactor experiments and for \nu_\mu to \nu_e
oscillations in long-baseline experiments.

contributions due to classical periodic rays. The required subtractions in the
spectral density are determined explicitly. The so defined semiclassical
Casimir energy coincides with that obtained using zeta function regularization
in the cases studied. Poles in the analytic continuation of zeta function
regularization are related to non-universal subtractions in the spectral
density. The sign of the Casimir energy of a scalar field on a smooth manifold
is estimated by the sign of the contribution due to the shortest periodic rays
only. Demanding continuity of the Casimir energy under small deformations of
the manifold, the method is extended to integrable systems. The Casimir energy
of a massless scalar field on a manifold with boundaries includes contributions
due to periodic rays that lie entirely within the boundaries. These
contributions in general depend on the boundary conditions. Although the
Casimir energy due to a massless scalar field may be sensitive to the physical
dimensions of manifolds with boundary, its sign can in favorable cases be
inferred without explicit calculation of the Casimir energy.

and closed superstrings. The gauge theory in question is found on N D3-branes
placed at the tip of the cone R^6/Gamma. In our previous work we showed that,
when the orbifold group Gamma breaks all supersymmetry, then typically the
gauge theory is not conformal because of double-trace couplings whose one-loop
beta functions do not possess real zeros. In this paper we observe a precise
correspondence between the instabilities caused by the flow of these
double-trace couplings and the presence of tachyons in the twisted sectors of
type IIB theory on orbifolds R^{3,1}x R^6/Gamma. For each twisted sectors that
does not contain tachyons, we show that the corresponding double-trace coupling
flows to a fixed point and does not cause an instability. However, whenever a
twisted sector is tachyonic, we find that the corresponding one-loop beta
function does not have a real zero, hence an instability is likely to exist in
the gauge theory. We demonstrate explicitly the one-to-one correspondence
between the regions of stability/instability in the space of charges under
Gamma that arise in the perturbative gauge theory and in the free string
theory. Possible implications of this remarkably simple gauge/string
correspondence are discussed.

By means of potential theory, for each $h>0$, we show the relation between the

$o(\exp(-h\sqrt{N}))$ and the distribution of the $h$-extrema of the rescaled
