star formation activity. In order to examine if such star formation activity
can be triggered by ionization fronts, we perform high-resolution hydrodynamics
and radiative transfer simulations of the effect of radiative feedback from
propagating ionization fronts on high-density clumps. We examine two sources of
ultraviolet (UV) radiation field to which high-redshift (z ~ 3) galaxies could
be exposed: one corresponding to the UV radiation originating from stars within
the DLA, itself, and the other corresponding to the UV background radiation. We
find that, for larger clouds, the propagating I-fronts created by local stellar
sources can trigger cooling instability and collapse of significant part, up to
85%, of the cloud, creating conditions for star formation in a timescale of a
few Myr. The passage of the I-front also triggers collapse of smaller clumps
(with radii below ~4 pc), but in these cases the resulting cold and dense gas
does not reach conditions conducive to star formation. Assuming that 85% of the
gas initially in the clump is converted into stars, we obtain a star formation
rate of $\sim 0.25 M_\odot {yr}^{-1} {kpc}^{-2}$. This is somewhat higher than
the value derived from recent observations. On the other hand, the background
UV radiation which has harder spectrum fails to trigger cooling and collapse.
Instead, the hard photons which have long mean-free-path heat the dense clumps,
which as a result expand and essentially dissolve in the ambient medium.
Therefore, the star formation activity in DLAs is strongly regulated by the
radiative feedback, both from the external UV background and internal stellar
sources and we predict quiescent evolution of DLAs (not starburst-like
evolution).

found to be in good agreement with the intergalactic medium (IGM) undergoing
large scale motions dominated by the Hubble flow. Modeling the Lyman alpha
clouds analytically and with a hydrodynamics simulation, the average expansion
velocity of the gaseous structures causing the Lyman alpha forest in the lower
redshift (z = 2) sample appears about 20 percent lower than the local Hubble
expansion velocity. We interpret this as tentative evidence for some clouds
undergoing gravitational collapse. However, the distribution of velocities is
highly skewed, and the majority of clouds at redshifts from 2 to 3.8 expand
typically about 5 - 20 percent faster than the Hubble flow. This behavior is
explained if most absorbers in the column density range typically detectable
are expanding filaments that stretch and drain into more massive nodes. We find
no evidence for the observed distribution of velocity shear being significantly
influenced by processes other than Hubble expansion and gravitational
instability, like galactic winds. To avoid overly disturbing the IGM, winds may
be old and/or limp by the time we observe them in the Lyman alpha forest, or

inverse Compton scatter the ambient ultraviolet and far infrared radiation
field, producing high energy gamma-rays with a roughly constant luminosity from

Convective instability is determined by the Richardson number Ri =

7774 O I triplet in high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 45 Hyades
dwarfs using standard one dimensional, plane-parallel LTE models. Effective
temperatures of the stellar sample range from 4319-6301 K, and the derived
relative O abundances as a function of T_eff evince a trichotomous morphology.
At T_eff > 6100 K, there is evidence of an increase in the O abundances with
increasing T_eff, consistent with non-LTE (NLTE) predictions. At intermediate
T_eff (5450 < T_eff < 6100 K), the O abundances are flat, and star-to-star
values are in good agreement, having a mean value of [O/H] = +0.25 +/- 0.02;
however, systematic errors at the ~0.10 dex level might exist. The O abundances
for stars with T_eff < 5450 K show a striking increase with decreasing T_eff,
in stark contrast to expectations and canonical NLTE calculations. The cool
Hyades triplet results are compared to those recently reported for dwarfs in
the Pleiades cluster and the UMa moving group; qualitative differences between
the trends observed in these stellar aggregates point to a possible age-related
diminution of triplet abundance trends in cool open cluster dwarfs.
Correlations with age-related phenomena, i.e., chromospheric activity and
photospheric spots, faculae, and/or plages, are investigated. No correlation
with Ca II H+K chromospheric activity indicators is observed. Multi-component
LTE ``toy'' models have been constructed in order to simulate photospheric
temperature inhomogeneities that could arise from the presence of starspots,
and we demonstrate that photospheric spots are a plausible source of the
triplet trends among the cool dwarfs.

negative magneto-resistance and spin polarization of the current, as well as
spin polarization of the current for anti-parallel magnetization of the Fe

simple, single nearly-free-electron-like Fermi surface. The conduction band is
composed of an antibonding state of Pb-$6s$ and O-$2p$ mixing with Ag-4d and

"cs/0509026","Mikkel Thorup","Nick Duffield, Carsten Lund, Mikkel Thorup","Sampling to estimate arbitrary subset sums",,,,,"cs.DS",,"  Starting with a set of weighted items, we want to create a generic sample of
a certain size that we can later use to estimate the total weight of arbitrary
subsets. For this purpose, we propose priority sampling which tested on
Internet data performed better than previous methods by orders of magnitude.
  Priority sampling is simple to define and implement: we consider a steam of
items i=0,...,n-1 with weights w_i. For each item i, we generate a random
number r_i in (0,1) and create a priority q_i=w_i/r_i. The sample S consists of
the k highest priority items. Let t be the (k+1)th highest priority. Each
sampled item i in S gets a weight estimate W_i=max{w_i,t}, while non-sampled
items get weight estimate W_i=0.
  Magically, it turns out that the weight estimates are unbiased, that is,
E[W_i]=w_i, and by linearity of expectation, we get unbiased estimators over
any subset sum simply by adding the sampled weight estimates from the subset.
Also, we can estimate the variance of the estimates, and surpricingly, there is
no co-variance between different weight estimates W_i and W_j.
  We conjecture an extremely strong near-optimality; namely that for any weight
sequence, there exists no specialized scheme for sampling k items with unbiased
estimators that gets smaller total variance than priority sampling with k+1
items. Very recently Mario Szegedy has settled this conjecture.

a penalty function of the form \[ R_{\tau}=\mathbb{P}(\tau<\theta)+c

this simple problem is more involved than solving the disorder problems for

stopping time turns out to coincide with the optimal stopping time of the
original problem for some range of parameters is also solved. The value
function of this problem serves as a tight upper bound for the original

to show the equivalence between their low-energy effective 2d actions. The
gauge theory effective action, which is represented by an effective
Landau-Lifshitz (LL) model, was previously found to match with the string
theory world-sheet action up to the first two orders in the effective parameter
$\tilde{\lambda} ={\lambda / J^2}$, where $\lambda$ is the `t Hooft coupling
and $J$ is the total $R$-charge. Here we address the question if quantizing the
effective LL action reproduces the subleading 1/J corrections to the spin chain
energies as well as the quantum corrections to the string energies. We
demonstrate that this is indeed the case provided one chooses an appropriate
regularization of the effective LL theory. Expanding near the BPS vacuum, we
show that the quantum LL action gives the same 1/J corrections to energies of
BMN states as found previously on the gauge theory and string theory sides. We
also compute the subleading $1/J^2$ corrections and show that these too match
with corrections computed from the Bethe ansatz. We also compare the results
from the LL action with a more direct computation from the spin chain. We
repeat the same computation for the $\beta$-deformed LL action and find that
the quantum LL result is again equal to the 1/J correction computed from the
$\beta$-deformed Bethe ansatz equations. We also quantize the LL action near
the rotating circular and folded string solutions, generalizing the known
gauge/string results for 1/J corrections to the classical energies. We
emphasize the simplicity of this effective field theory approach as compared to
the full quantum string computations.

we study multivariable analogs for block-Toeplitz matrices as well as for

systems (which include block-Toeplitz ones). We characterize state-covariances
which admit only a deterministic input power spectrum. We show that
multivariable decomposition of a state-covariance in accordance with a
``deterministic component + white noise'' hypothesis for the input does not
exist in general, and develop formulae for spectra corresponding to singular
covariances via decomposing the contribution of the singular part. We consider
replacing the ``scalar multiple of the identity'' in the CFP decomposition by a
covariance of maximal trace which is admissible as a summand. The summand can
be either (block-)diagonal corresponding to white noise or have a ``short-range
correlation structure'' correponding to a moving average component. The trace
represents the maximal variance/energy that can be accounted for by a process
(e.g., noise) with the aforementioned structure at the input, and the optimal
solution can be computed via convex optimization. The decomposition of
covariances and spectra according to the range of their time-domain
correlations is an alternative to the CFP-dictum with potentially great
practical significance.

integro-differential equations. Conditions are provided under which
preservation of convexity holds, i.e. under which the value, calculated under a
chosen martingale measure, of an option with a convex contract function is
convex as a function of the underlying stock price. The preservation of
convexity is then used to derive monotonicity properties of the option value
with respect to the different parameters of the model, such as the volatility,
the jump size and the jump intensity.

particular, it was demonstrated that both sealed and flushed by a gas detectors

strongly indicate that they can be cheap and simple alternatives to

  fixed a proof",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The quantum adversary method is a versatile method for proving lower bounds
on quantum algorithms. It yields tight bounds for many computational problems,
is robust in having many equivalent formulations, and has natural connections
to classical lower bounds. A further nice property of the adversary method is
that it behaves very well with respect to composition of functions. We
generalize the adversary method to include costs--each bit of the input can be
given an arbitrary positive cost representing the difficulty of querying that
bit. We use this generalization to exactly capture the adversary bound of a
composite function in terms of the adversary bounds of its component functions.
Our results generalize and unify previously known composition properties of
adversary methods, and yield as a simple corollary the Omega(sqrt{n}) bound of
Barnum and Saks on the quantum query complexity of read-once functions.

standing-wave cavity field can impart position information of the atom passing
through it leading to subwavelength atom localization. We recently demonstrated
a new regime of atom localization [Sahrai {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 72},
013820 (2005)], namely sub-half-wavelength localization through phase control
of electromagnetically induced transparency. This regime corresponds to extreme
localization of atoms within a chosen half-wavelength region of the
standing-wave cavity field. Here we present further investigation of the
simplified model considered earlier and show interesting features of the
proposal. We show how the model can be used to simulate variety of energy level
schemes. Furthermore, the dressed-state analysis is employed to explain the
emergence and suppression of the localization peaks, and the peak positions and
widths. The range of parameters for obtaining clean sub-half-wavelength
localization is identified.
