very high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopic time-series

confirm outstanding diversity of pulsational behaviour of different lines in
the HR 3831 spectrum and attribute this phenomenon to an interplay between
extreme vertical chemical inhomogeneity of the HR 3831 atmosphere and a running
pulsation wave, propagating towards the upper photospheric layers with
increasing amplitude. Rapid profile variation of the NdIII 6145 A line is
characterized by measuring changes of its equivalent width and the first three
moments. We demonstrate that rotational modulation of the radial velocity
oscillations cannot be fully explained by an oblique axisymmetric dipole
(ell=1, m=0) mode, implied by the classical oblique pulsator model of roAp
stars. Pulsational variation of the higher moments reveal substantial
contribution of the high-order (ell=3) spherical harmonics which appear due to
distortion of pulsations in HR 3831 by the global magnetic field. We interpret
observations with a novel numerical model of the pulsational variation and
rotational modulation of the line profile moments in roAp stars. The comparison
between observed and computed amplitudes and phases of the radial velocity and
line width variation is used to establish parameters of the oblique pulsator
model of HR 3831. Furthermore, definite detection of pulsational variation in
lines of light and iron-peak elements enables the first 3-D mapping of

37 to 230 pc with a median distance of 109 pc. LISM O VI is detected with
>2sigma significance along 24 of 39 lines of sight. The column densities range
from log N(O VI) = 12.38 to 13.60 with a median value of 13.10. The line of
sight volume density, n(O VI) = N(O VI)/d exhibits a large dispersion ranging
from (0.68 to 13.0)x10(-8) cm(-3) with an average value 3.6x10(-8) cm(-3) twice
larger than found for more distant sight lines in the Galactic disk. The
narrowest profiles are consistent with thermal Doppler broadening of O VI near
its temperature of peak abundance, 2.8x10(5) K. Comparison of the average
velocities of O VI and C II absorption reveals 10 cases where the O VI
absorption is closely aligned with the C II absorption as expected if the O VI
is formed in a condensing interface between the cool and warm absorption and a
hot exterior gas. The comparison also reveals 13 cases where O VI absorption is
displaced to positive velocity by 7 to 29 km/s from the average velocity of C
II. The positive velocity O VI appears to be tracing the evaporative flow of O
VI from a young interface between warm gas and a hot exterior medium. However,
it is possible the positive velocity O VI is instead tracing cooling hot Local
Bubble (LB) gas. The properties of the O VI absorption in the LISM are broadly
consistent with the expectations of the theory of conductive interfaces caught
in the old condensing phase and possibly in the young evaporative phase of
their evolution.

ChaI cloud based on radial velocities (RVs) measured with UVES / VLT. This is
compared to the kinematics of T Tauri stars (TTS) in the same field, based on
both own measurements and on RVs from the literature. More UVES spectra were
taken compared with a former paper (Joergens & Guenther 2001), and the
reduction of the spectra was improved, while studying the literature for RVs of
T Tauri stars in ChaI led to a cleaned and enlarged sample of T Tauri stars.
The result is an improved empirical RV distribution of BDs as well as of TTS in
ChaI. We found that nine BDs/VLMSs (M6-M8) in ChaI have a RV dispersion of 0.9
km/s measured in terms of a standard deviation. This is consistent with the
dispersion measured earlier in terms of fwhm of 2.1 km/s. The studied sample of
25 TTS (G2-M5) has a dispersion of 1.3 km/s (standard deviation). The RV
dispersion of the BDs is consistent within the errors with that of TTS, which
is in line with the finding of no mass dependence in some theoretical models of
the ejection-scenario for the formation of brown dwarfs. In contrast to current
N-body simulations, we did not find a high-velocity tail for the BDs RVs. We
found hints suggesting different kinematics for binaries compared to
predominantly single objects in ChaI. The global RV dispersion for ChaI members
(1.24 km/s) is significantly lower than for Taurus members (2.0 km/s), despite
higher stellar density in ChaI showing that a fundamental increase in velocity
dispersion with stellar density of the star-forming region is not established
observationally. The RVs of BDs observed in ChaI are less dispersed than
predicted by existing models for the ejection-scenario.

small rms electron temperature fluctuations and fail to reproduce the heavy
element optical recombination line (ORL) spectrum of the nebula. Dual abundance
models incorporating small-scale chemical inhomogeneities in the form of
H-deficient inclusions which are in pressure balance with the normal
composition ambient gas, provide a better fit to the observed heavy element
ORLs and other nebular lines, while most spectral features are satisfactorily
accounted for. The inclusions, whose mass is ~2 per cent of the total gaseous
mass, are 2-3 times cooler and denser than the ambient nebula. Their O/H
abundance ratio is ~0.9 dex larger than in the normal composition gas and have
typical mass fractions of X = 0.687, Y = 0.273 and Z = 0.040. Helium is found
to be about as deficient as hydrogen in the inclusions, while elements heavier
than Ne, such as S and Ar, are quite possibly enhanced in proportions similar
to O. This suggests that the posited H-deficient inclusions may have arisen
from partial mixing of matter which was nucleosynthetically processed in a
supernova event with gas of normal LMC composition. Attention is drawn to a
bias in the determination of HII region helium abundances in the presence of
H-deficient inclusions. It is argued that these results provide evidence for
incomplete small-scale mixing of the ISM. The case for the existence of

an effort to mitigate the effects of atmospheric instabilities which limit the
phase coherence of the array especially in the higher frequency bands, the
array was designed to allow simultaneous operation of a low frequency receiver
(<350 GHz) with a high frequency receiver (>330 GHz). The overlap region of
330-350 GHz was included to facilitate dual polarization measurements in the
frequency range considered to offer the highest sensitivity for continuum
observations with the array.
  So far, the array is equipped with working SIS receivers covering the
frequency ranges 176-256 GHz, 260-350 GHz, and 600-700 GHz, and single
frequency operation has been routine in the lower two frequency bands for the
past year. More recently, with the completion of IF hardware required to make
full use of the SMA cross-correlator, dual receiver operation became possible.

mass about 8-25 solar masses that end their lives as red supergiants. The
expected stellar end points can be found from evolutionary calculations and the
corresponding mass loss properties at this point can be estimated from typical
values for Galactic stars. The mass loss densities of observed supernovae can
be estimated from observations of the thermal X-ray and radio synchrotron
emission that result from the interaction of the supernova with the surrounding
wind. Type IIP supernovae are expected to have energy-conserving interaction
during typical times of observation. Because Type IIP supernovae have an
extended period of high optical luminosity, Compton cooling can affect the
radio emitting electrons, giving rise to a relatively flat radio light curve in
the optically thin regime. Alternatively, a high efficiency of magnetic field
production results in synchrotron cooling of the radio emitting electrons. Both
the X-ray and radio luminosities are sensitive to the mass loss and initial
masses of the progenitor stars, although the turn-on of radio emission is
probably the best estimator of circumstellar density. Both the mass loss
density and the variation of density with stellar mass are consistent with
expectations for the progenitor stars deduced from direct observations of
recent supernovae. Current observations are consistent with mass being the only
parameter; observations of a supernova in a metal poor region might show how
the mass loss depends on metallicity.

find a mean rate of 0.054 mergers per galaxy per Gyr above a 1:2 mass ratio
threshold for massive galaxies (baryonic mass above 6.4E10 \Msun), but only
0.018 / Gyr for lower mass galaxies. The mass ratio distribution is
proportional to R_merg^-1.2 for the massive galaxy sample, so high mass mergers
dominate the total merger growth rate. The predicted rates increase rapidly
with increasing redshift, and they agree reasonably well with observational
estimates. A substantial fraction of galaxies do not experience any resolved
mergers during the course of the simulation, and even for the high mass sample
only 50% of galaxies experience a greater than 1:4 merger since z=1. Typical
galaxies thus have fairly quiescent merger histories.
  We assign bulge-to-disk ratios to simulated galaxies by assuming that mergers
above a mass ratio threshold R_major convert stellar disks into spheroids. With
R_major of 1:4, we obtain a fairly good match to the observed dependence of
early-type fraction on galaxy mass. However, the predicted fraction of truly
bulge-dominated systems (f_bulge} > 0.8) is small, and producing a substantial
population of bulge-dominated galaxies may require a mechanism that shuts off
gas accretion at late times and/or additional processes (besides major mergers)
for producing bulges.

interpreted by combining two other trends: the correlation between the star

also the first GRB with a dust-scattered X-ray halo. The observation of the
halo allowed us to infer the presence of a large soft X-ray fluence in the
total burst output. It has, however, also been claimed that GRB031203 was
intrinsically sub-energetic, representative of a class of spectrally hard,
low-energy bursts quite different from other GRBs. Reanalysis of the available
data confirms our original finding that GRB031203 had a very large soft X-ray
component, the time of which can be constrained to within a few minutes after
the burst, implying that while GRB031203 did indeed have a very low apparent
luminosity, it was also very soft. Notions propagated in the literature
regarding the uncertainties in the determination of the soft X-ray fluence from
the halo data and on the available constraints from the hard X-ray data are
addressed: the properties of the scattering dust along the line of sight (grain
sizes, precise location and the geometry) are determined directly from the high
quality X-ray data so that there is little uncertainty about the scatterer;
constraints on the X-ray lightcurve from the Integral spacecraft at the time of
the soft X-ray blast are not complete because of a slew in the spacecraft
pointing shortly after the burst. Claims that GRB031203 was intrinsically
under-energetic and that it represents a deviation from the luminosity-peak
energy relation do not appear to be substantiated by the data, regardless of
whether the soft X-ray component is declared part of the prompt emission or the
afterglow. We conclude that the difference between the soft and hard X-ray
spectra from XMM-Newton and Integral indicate that a second soft pulse probably
occurred in this burst as has been observed in other GRBs, notably GRB050502B.

LambdaCDM cosmology, utilise a smoothing prior and perform Monte Carlo

spectral index n_s=0.97, very close to the concordance spectrum. The horizon
scale for the model we are considering corresponds to the wavenumber
k_h=4.52X10^{-4} Mpc^{-1}. We find some evidence for the presence of features
and we quantify the probabilities of exceeding the observed deviations in WMAP
data with respect to the fiducial models. We detect the following marginal
departures from a scale-free (spectral index n_s=0.97) initial spectrum: a
cut-off at 0.0001<k<0.001 Mpc^{-1} at 79.5% (92%), a dip at 0.001<k<0.003

  These frequentist confidence levels are calculated by integrating over the
distribution of the Monte Carlo reconstructions built around the fiducial

Bayesian analysis the model is about 1.5 sigma away from the estimated

relatively low accretion rates and/or accretion efficiencies onto their central

significantly as a function of optical luminosity and stellar mass, implying
that more massive galaxies have higher nuclear accretion rates than lower mass

in the evidence of kick-spin alignment/misalignment and its dependence on the
neutron star initial spin period. For several young pulsars, X-ray observations
of compact nebulae showed that pulsar proper motion is aligned with the spin
direction as defined by the symmetry axis of the nebula. We also critically
examine the measurements of the proper motion and the projected spin axis from
a large sample of pulsars with well-calibrated polarization data. We find that
among the two dozen pulsars for which reliable measurements are available,
there is a significant correlation between the spin axis and the proper motion.
For various NS binaries, including double NS systems, binaries with massive
main-sequence star companion and binaries with massive white-dwarf companion,
we obtain constraints on the kick magnitudes and directions from the observed
orbital characteristics of the system. We find that the kick velocity is
misaligned with the the NS spin axis in a number of systems, and the NS spin
period (when available) in these systems is generally longer than several
hundreds milliseconds. These constraints, together with spin-kick alignment
observed in many isolated pulsars, suggest that the kick timescale is hundreds
of milliseconds to 1 s, so that spin-kick alignment or misalignment can be
obtained depending on the initial spin period of the NS. We discuss the
implication of our result for various NS kick mechanisms.

discover the presence of a sharp drop below ~ 2 keV in its spectrum. Such a
flat photon index and the huge luminosity suggest that the X-ray emission is
due to the low energy tail of the Comptonized spectrum, produced from plasma in
a relativistic jet oriented close to our line of sight. Even though the
hypothesis of a break in the continuum cannot be completely discarded as an
explanation of the soft X-ray cutoff, the presence of intrinsic absorption
appears more plausible. Spectral fits with cold (Nh(z) = 1.62+/-0.09 x 10^{22}

produced to the MMRD in the two filters. However, we are unable to verify the
$t_{15}$ relationship for either Sloan filter. The subsequent analysis of our
automated CN detection pipeline has provided us with the most thorough
knowledge of the completeness of a CN survey to-date. In addition, the large
field of view of the survey has permitted us to probe the outburst rate well
into the galactic disk, unlike previous CCD imaging surveys. Using this
analysis we are able to probe the CN distribution of M31 and evaluate the
global nova rate. Using models of the galactic surface brightness of M31, we
show that the observed CN distribution consists of a separate bulge and disk
population. We also show that the M31 bulge CN eruption rate per unit $r'$ flux
is more than five times greater than that of the disk. We deduce a global M31
CN rate of $65^{+16}_{-15}$ year$^{-1}$, a value much higher than found by
previous surveys. Using the global rate, we derive a M31 bulge rate of
$38^{+15}_{-12}$ year$^{-1}$ and a disk rate of $27^{+19}_{-15}$ year$^{-1}$.
Given our understanding of the completeness and an analysis of other sources of
error, we conclude that the true global nova rate of M31 is at least 50% higher
than was previously thought and this has consequent implications for the
presumed CN rate in the Milky Way. We deduce a Galactic bulge rate of
$14^{+6}_{-5}$ year$^{-1}$, a disk rate of $20^{+14}_{-11}$ year$^{-1}$ and a
global Galactic rate of $34^{+15}_{-12}$ year$^{-1}$.

verified for a variety of continuous time, periodic boundary systems in the KPZ

the entire particle flux of the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP), thus
providing an alternative to more difficult cumulant ratios studies. Using this

simple models with two competing states and a resistor network approximation to
calculate conductances has confirmed that CMR effects can be theoretically
reproduced using non-uniform clustered states. In this paper, the recently
proposed Truncated Polynomial Expansion method (TPEM) for spin-fermion systems
is tested using the double-exchange one-band, with finite Hund coupling $J_{\rm
H}$, and two-band, with infinite $J_{\rm H}$, models. Two dimensional lattices
as large as 48$\times$48 are studied, far larger than those that can be handled
with standard exact diagonalization (DIAG) techniques for the fermionic sector.
The clean limit (i.e. without quenched disorder) is here analyzed in detail.
Phase diagrams are obtained, showing first-order transitions separating
ferromagnetic metallic from insulating states. A huge magnetoresistance is
found at low temperatures by including small magnetic fields, in excellent
agreement with experiments. However, at temperatures above the Curie transition
the effect is much smaller confirming that the standard finite-temperature CMR
phenomenon cannot be understood using homogeneous states. By comparing results
between the two methods, TPEM and DIAG, on small lattices, and by analyzing the
systematic behavior with increasing cluster sizes, it is concluded that the
TPEM is accurate to handle realistic manganite models on large systems. Our
results pave the way to a frontal computational attack of the colossal
magnetoresistance phenomenon using double-exchange like models, on large
clusters, and including quenched disorder.

theory. It postulates a partition of phase space into reactant and product
regions, which are separated by a dividing surface that reactive trajectories
must cross. In order not to overestimate the reaction rate, the dynamics must
be free of recrossings of the dividing surface. This no-recrossing rule is
difficult (and sometimes impossible) to enforce, however, when a chemical
reaction takes place in a fluctuating environment such as a liquid.
High-accuracy approximations to the rate are well known when the solvent forces
are treated using stochastic representations, though again, exact no-recrossing
surfaces have not been available. To generalize the exact limit of TST to
reactive systems driven by noise, we introduce a time-dependent dividing
surface that is stochastically moving in phase space such that it is crossed
once and only once by each transition path.

allowing for the Debye screening, recharging of sluggish surface charge layers
caused by emission current between the tip apex and sample surface.For the
first time we calculated the realistic sizes of nanodomains recorded in BaTiO3,
PbZrxTi1-xO3 and LiTaO3 ferroelectric-semiconductor thin films in contrast to
the over-estimated ones obtained in the evolved approaches. We have shown that
the depolarization field energy of the domain butt, Debye screening effects and
field emission at high voltages lead to the essential decrease of the
equilibrium domain sizes. For the first time we obtained, that the domain
radius does not decrease continuously with applied voltage decrease: the domain
appears with non-zero radius at definite critical voltage applied to the tip.
This result completely agrees with experimentally observed threshold domain
recording in PbZrxTi1-xO3 and LiTaO3 thin films. Such threshold domain
formation is similar to the first order phase transition. We hope, that our
results will help one to determine the necessary recording conditions and
appropriate ferroelectric medium in order to obtain the stable domains with
minimum lateral size in a wide range of applied voltages.

mathematicians, computer scientist, coding theorists and even the mass press.
In the game, $n$ players are fitted with randomly assigned colored hats.
Individual players can see their teammates' hat colors, but not their own.
Based on this information, and without any further communication, each player
must attempt to guess his hat color, or pass. The team wins if there is at
least one correct guess, and no incorrect ones. The goal is to devise guessing
strategies that maximize the team winning probability. We show that for the
case of two hat colors, and for any value of $n$, playing strategies are
equivalent to binary covering codes of radius one. This link, in particular
with Hamming codes, had been observed for values of $n$ of the form $2^m-1$. We
extend the analysis to games with hats of $q$ colors, $q\geq 2$, where
1-coverings are not sufficient to characterize the best strategies. Instead, we
introduce the more appropriate notion of a {\em strong covering}, and show
efficient constructions of these coverings, which achieve winning probabilities
approaching unity. Finally, we briefly discuss results on variants of the
problem, including arbitrary input distributions, randomized playing
strategies, and symmetric strategies.

(almost inevitable) `perfect wetting' of the k=N/2 domain wall. Our

beta-equilibrium for a wide range of the quark-quark coupling strength within a
four-Fermion model. A comprehensive and unified picture for the phase
transitions from weak to strong coupling is presented. We first develop a
technique to deal with the gap equation and neutrality constraints without
recourse to numerical derivatives, and show that the off-diagonal color
densities automatically vanish with the standard assumption for the diquark
condensates. The following are shown by the numerical analyses: (i) The
thermally-robustest pairing phase is the two-flavor pairing (2SC) in any
coupling case, while the second one for relatively low density is the up-quark
pairing (uSC) phase or the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase depending on the
coupling strength and the value of strange quark mass. (ii) If the diquark
coupling strength is large enough, the phase diagram is much simplified and is
free from the instability problems associated with imaginary Meissner masses in
the gapless phases. (iii) The interplay between the chiral and diquark dynamics
may bring a non-trivial first order transition even in the pairing phases at
high density. We confirm (i) also by using the Ginzburg-Landau analysis
expanding the pair susceptibilities up to quartic order in the strange quark
mass. We obtain the analytic expression for the doubly critical density where
the two lines for the second order phase transitions merge, and below which the
down-quark pairing (dSC) phase is taken over by the uSC phase. Also we study
how the phase transitions from fully gapped states to partially ungapped states
are smeared at finite temperature by introducing the order parameters for these
transitions.

of the SU(3)/SU(N_c) gauge group and involving an arbitrary number of covariant
derivatives projected onto the light-cone. To one-loop order, the dilatation
operator inherits the conformal symmetry of the classical theory and is given
in the multi-color limit by a local Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg magnet with
the spin operators being generators of the collinear subgroup of full
(super)conformal group. Starting from two loops, the dilatation operator
depends on the representation of the gauge group and, in addition, receives
corrections stemming from the violation of the conformal symmetry. We compute
its eigenspectrum and demonstrate that to two-loop order integrability survives
the conformal symmetry breaking in the aforementioned gauge theories, but it is
violated in QCD by the contribution of nonplanar diagrams. In SYM theories with
extended supersymmetry, the N-dependence of the two-loop dilatation operator
can be factorized (modulo an additive normalization constant) into a
multiplicative c-number. This property makes the eigenspectrum of the two-loop
dilatation operator alike in all gauge theories including the maximally
supersymmetric theory. Our analysis suggests that integrability is only tied to
the planar limit and it is sensitive neither to conformal symmetry nor
supersymmetry.

approach to singularity in loop quantum gravity. It is analogous to Planck's
law of radiation where similar change occurs for high and low energy behavior.
This is how it seems to anticipate in qualitative terms and in the right sense
the quantum gravity effect in 5 dimensions where it is physically non-trivial.
The really interesting question is, could this desirable feature be brought
down to the $4-$dimensional spacetime by dilatonic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet
term or otherwise?

R^{d} and difference equations on the lattice Z^{d}. The systems involve two
small parameters: one is the ratio of the slow and the fast time scales, and
another one is the ratio of the small and the large space scales. We show that
a wide class of such systems, including nonlinear Schrodinger and Maxwell
equations, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model and many other not completely integrable
systems, satisfy a superposition principle. The principle essentially states
that if a nonlinear evolution of a wave starts initially as a sum of generic
wavepackets (defined as almost monochromatic waves), then this wave with a high
accuracy remains a sum of separate wavepacket waves undergoing independent
nonlinear evolution. The time intervals for which the evolution is considered
are long enough to observe fully developed nonlinear phenomena for involved
wavepackets. In particular, our approach provides a simple justification for
numerically observed effect of almost non-interaction of solitons passing
through each other without any recourse to the complete integrability. Our
analysis does not rely on any ansatz or common asymptotic expansions with
respect to the two small parameters but it uses rather explicit and
constructive representation for solutions as functions of the initial data in
the form of functional analytic series.

internet traffic. Long-range dependence can be defined as the regular variation
of the variance of the integrated process, and half the index of regular
variation is then referred to as the Hurst index. The infinite-source Poisson
process (a particular case of which is the $M/G/\infty$ queue) is a simple and
popular model with this property, when the tail of the service time
distribution is regularly varying. The Hurst index of the infinite-source
Poisson process is then related to the index of regular variation of the
service times. In this paper, we present a wavelet-based estimator of the Hurst
index of this process, when it is observed either continuously or discretely
over an increasing time interval. Our estimator is shown to be consistent and
robust to some form of non-stationarity. Its rate of convergence is
investigated.

  approximating multivariate integrals","44 pages, LaTeX2e. submitted to Annals of Mathematics",,,,"math.FA math.NA",,"  Due to its intimate relation to Spectral Theory and Schr\""{o}dinger
operators, the multivariate moment problem has been a subject of many
researches, so far without essential success (if one compares with the
one--dimensional case). In the present paper we reconsider a basic axiom of the
standard approach - the positivity of the measure. We introduce the so--called
pseudopositive measures instead. One of our main achievements is the solution
of the moment problem in the class of the pseudopositive measures. A measure \
$\mu$ is called pseudopositive if its Laplace-Fourier coefficients
$\mu_{k,l}(r) ,$ $r\geq0,$ in the expansion in spherical harmonics are
non--negative. Another main profit of our approach is that for pseudopositive
measures we may develop efficient ''cubature formulas'' by generalizing the
classical procedure of Gauss--Jacobi: for every integer \ $p\geq1$ we construct
a new pseudopositive measure $\nu_{p}$ having ''minimal support'' and such that
$\mu(h) =\nu_{p}(h) $ for every polynomial $h$ with $\Delta^{2p}h=0.$ The proof
of this result requires application of the famous theory of Chebyshev, Markov,
Stieltjes, Krein for extremal properties of the Gauss-Jacobi measure, by
employing the classical orthogonal polynomials $p_{k,l;j},$ $j\geq0,$ with
respect to every measure $\mu_{k,l}.$ As a byproduct we obtain a notion of
multivariate orthogonality defined by the polynomials $p_{k,l;j}$. A major
motivation for our investigation has been the further development of new models
for the multivariate Schr\""{o}dinger operators, which generalize the classical
result of M. Stone saying that the one--dimensional orthogonal polynomials
represent a model for the self--adjoint operators with simple spectrum.

family of subsets, each of size (k), from a fixed set of size (n (n > 2k)),
then the largest possible pairwise intersecting family has size (t ={n-1\choose
k-1}). We consider the probability that a randomly selected family of size
(t=t_n) has the EKR property (pairwise nonempty intersection) as $n$ and
$k=k_n$ tend to infinity, the latter at a specific rate. As $t$ gets large, the
EKR property is less likely to occur, while as $t$ gets smaller, the EKR
property is satisfied with high probability. We derive the threshold value for
$t$ using Janson's inequality. Using the Stein-Chen method we show that the
distribution of $X_0$, defined as the number of disjoint pairs of subsets in
our family, can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. We extend our
results to yield similar conclusions for $X_i$, the number of pairs of subsets
that overlap in exactly $i$ elements. Finally, we show that the joint
distribution $(X_0, X_1, ..., X_b)$ can be approximated by a multidimensional
Poisson vector with independent components.

technique for calculation of the astrophysical processes in the presence of
subthreshold bound states, in particular, two different mechanisms are
discussed: direct capture to the subthreshold state and capture to the
low-lying bound states through the subthreshold state, which plays the role of
the subthreshold resonance. The ANC technique can also be used to determine the
interference sign of the resonant and nonresonant (direct) terms of the
reaction amplitude. The TH method is unique indirect technique allowing one to
measure astrophysical rearrangement reactions down to astrophysically relevant
energies. We explain why there is no Coulomb barrier in the sub-process

underlying electromagnetic under-screening as well as screening effects between

conclusion is that an effective oscillatory instantaneous Coulomb potential
between the like-charged collective electrons contributes a very large negative
term to the equation of state. This counterintuitive like-charged attraction
results from the modulation factor of the opposite charged baryon superfluid
background. The anomalous long distance quantum dragging effects between the

environment. The physics is of the strongly coupling characteristic in a

viewed as a cavity electron in which the s-type wave function fills the

model in which the ammoniated electron is regarded as a solvent stabilized
multimer radical anion, as was originally suggested by Symons [Chem. Soc. Rev.
1976, 5, 337]. In this model, most of the excess electron density resides in
the frontier orbitals of N atoms in the ammonia molecules forming the solvation
cavity; a fraction of this spin density is transferred to the molecules in the
second solvation shell. The cavity is formed due to the repulsion between
negatively charged solvent molecules. Using density functional theory
calculations for small ammonia cluster anions in the gas phase, it is
demonstrated that such core anions would semi-quantitatively account for the
observed pattern of Knight shifts for 1-H and 14-N nuclei observed by NMR
spectroscopy and the downshifted stretching and bending modes observed by
infrared spectroscopy. It is speculated that the excess electrons in other
aprotic solvents (but not in water and alcohols) might be, in this respect,
analogous to the ammoniated electron, with substantial transfer of the spin
density into the frontier N and C orbitals of methyl, amino, and amide groups
forming the solvation cavity.

interaction potential to represent passive and active helicase mechanisms. A
passive helicase must wait for thermal fluctuations to open dsNA base pairs
before it can advance and inhibit NA closing. An active helicase directly
destabilizes dsNA base pairs, accelerating the opening rate. Here we extend
this model to include helicase unbinding from the nucleic-acid strand. The
helicase processivity depends on the form of the interaction potential. A
passive helicase has a mean attachment time which does not change between ss
translocation and ds unwinding, while an active helicase in general shows a

respectively. At low temperature, non vanishing interspine hopping constants
yield a three dimensional nature of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II which the wave
functions extend over the three spines of the helix. At biological temperature,
the pairs are confined in a given spine and exhibit the same features as the
bound states described within a one-dimensional model. The interplay between
the temperature and the 3D nature of the helix is also responsible for the
occurrence of a third bound state called TVBS-III which refers to the trapping
of two vibrons onto two different spines. The experimental signature of the
