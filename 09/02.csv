the fourth accreting millisecond pulsar (AMP). This is the second AMP
exhibiting twin kHz QPOs. In contrast to the first case, SAX J1808.4--3658, the
frequency separation $\Delta\nu$ between the kHz QPOs is consistent with the
pulse frequency (190.6 Hz), not with half that value, confirming for the first
time from pulsation measurements the inference, based on burst oscillations,
that 'slow rotators' (spin frequency less than 400 Hz) have $\Delta\nu$
approximately equal to the spin frequency. While the QPOs move in frequency
together over a range of more than 200 Hz, $\Delta\nu$ remains constant with an
average value of 205$\pm$6 Hz. Variability components were found in the 5--130
Hz range similar to those seen in other LMXBs. The correlations between the QPO
and noise frequencies are also similar to those in other sources, but shifted
by a factor of 1.59 in kHz QPO frequencies, similar to the factor 1.45 shift
found for SAX J1808.4--3658. Our results argue in favour of a spin-related
formation mechanism for twin kHz QPOs and against a spin-related cause of the
shift in the frequency correlations.

potential source of systematic error is intrinsic alignments of ellipticities
of neighbouring galaxies (II correlation) that could mimic the correlations due
to lensing. A related possibility pointed out by Hirata and Seljak (2004) is
correlation between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the density
field responsible for gravitational lensing shear (GI correlation). We present
constraints on both the II and GI correlations using 265 908 spectroscopic
galaxies from the SDSS, and using galaxies as tracers of the mass in the case
of the GI analysis. The availability of redshifts in the SDSS allows us to
select galaxies at small radial separations, which both reduces noise in the
intrinsic alignment measurement and suppresses galaxy- galaxy lensing (which
otherwise swamps the GI correlation). While we find no detection of the II
correlation, our results are nonetheless statistically consistent with recent
detections found using the SuperCOSMOS survey. In contrast, we have a clear
detection of GI correlation in galaxies brighter than L* that persists to the
largest scales probed (60 Mpc/h) and with a sign predicted by theoretical
models. This correlation could cause the existing lensing surveys at z~1 to
underestimate the linear amplitude of fluctuations by as much as 20% depending
on the source sample used, while for surveys at z~0.5 the underestimation may
reach 30%. (Abridged.)

spectrum in the X-ray band, and a flat/inverted radio/IR spectrum associated
with occasionally imaged compact jets. It has generally been thought that the
hard X-rays result from Compton upscattering of thermal accretion disk photons
by a hot, coronal plasma whose properties are inferred via spectral fitting.
Interestingly, these properties-especially those from certain magnetized corona
models-are very similar to the derived plasma conditions at the jet footpoints.
Here we explore the question of whether the `corona' and `jet base' are in fact
related, starting by testing the strongest premise that they are synonymous. In
such models, the radio through the soft X-rays are dominated by synchrotron
emission, while the hard X-rays are dominated by inverse Compton at the jet
base - with both disk and synchrotron photons acting as seed photons. The
conditions at the jet base fix the conditions along the rest of the jet, thus
creating a direct link between the X-ray and radio emission. We also add to
this model a simple iron line and convolve the spectrum with neutral
reflection. After forward-folding the predicted spectra through the detector
response functions, we compare the results to simultaneous radio/X-ray data
obtained from the hard states of the Galactic XRBs GX339-4 and Cygnus X-1.
Results from simple Compton corona model fits are also presented for
comparison. We demonstrate that the jet model fits are statistically as good as
the single-component corona model X-ray fits, yet are also able to address the
simultaneous radio data.

the induced shape of the 3-point function can be very well approximated by a

has a full sky map with uniform noise, in order to saturate the Cramer-Rao

GHz is similar to that at 8 GHz (though diminished in amplitude), the ISS
variation is much stronger at 2 than at 8 GHz. We characterize the ISS

these parameters for the 121 sources with significant ISS at 2 GHz. We model
the scintillations using the NE2001 Galactic electron model assuming the

$10^{11}$--$10^{12}$K. Thus our results are consistent with cm-wavelength VLBI
studies of compact AGNs, in that the maximum brightness temperatures found are
consistent with the inverse synchrotron limit at $3 \times 10^{11}$ K, boosted
in jet configurations by Doppler factors up to about 20. The average of the
observed 2 GHz ISS timescales is in reasonable agreement with the model at

other galaxies arising along the line-of-sight. It will be applied to larger

distribution of galaxies in a dark matter halo -- as the fundamental building
block, we present an empirical model for the galaxy distribution. The model
predictions are compared with the published luminosity function and clustering
statistics from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts, and galaxy
correlation functions from COMBO-17 survey at a redshift of 0.6, DEEP2 survey
at a redshift of unity, and Great Observatories Deep Origins Survey (GOODS) at
a redshift around 3. The comparison with statistical measurements allows us to
constrain certain parameters related to analytical descriptions that describe
the relation between a dark matter halo and its central galaxy luminosity, its
satellite galaxy luminosity, and the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies
of that halo. The single parameter best constrained by clustering measurements
is the total satellite galaxy luminosity averaged over the halo mass
distribution probed by the galaxy sample. For SDSS, $<L_{\rm sat}>
=(2.1^{+0.8}_{-0.4}) \times 10^{10}$ h${-2}$ L$_{\sun}$, while for GOODS at $z
\sim 3$, $<L_{\rm sat}> < 2 \times 10^{11}$ h$^{-2}$ L$_{\sun}$. Quantities
such as the fraction of satellite galaxies at a given galaxy luminosity are not
strongly constrained with SDSS data. We use our CLFs to establish probability
distribution of halo mass in which galaxies of a given luminosity could be
found either at halo centers or as satellites. Finally, to help establish
further properties of the galaxy distribution, we propose the measurement of
cross-clustering between galaxies divided into two distinctly different
luminosity bins.

significantly higher than the CO pressure, implying that shock waves may be
driven into the CO clouds. Comparison of the metal abundances with the average
stellar yields predicted by theoretical models of SN explosions points to SNe
of Type II as the main contributors of metals to the hot ISM. There is no
evidence of any correlation between radio-optical star-formation indicators and
the measured metal abundances. Although due to uncertainties in the average gas
density we cannot exclude that mixing may have played an important role, the
short time required to produce the observed metal masses (<=2 Myr) suggests
that the correlations are unlikely to have been destroyed by efficient mixing.
More likely, a significant fraction of SN II ejecta may be in a cool phase, in

photospheric excess in the J and H bands. We first show that normalizing the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of cTTs to the J-band leads to a poor fit
of the optical fluxes, while normalizing the SEDs to the Ic-band produces a
better fit to the optical bands and in many cases reveals the presence of a
considerable excess at J and H. NIR spectroscopic veiling measurements from the
literature support this result. We find that J and H-band excesses correlate
well with the K-band excess, and that the J-K and H-K colors of the excess
emission are consistent with that of a black body at the dust sublimation
temperature (~ 1500-2000 K). We propose that this near-IR excess originates at
a hot inner rim, analogous to those suggested to explain the near-IR bump in
the SEDs of Herbig Ae/Be stars. To test our hypothesis, we use the model
presented by Dullemond et al. (2001) to fit the photometry data between 0.5 um
and 24 um of 10 cTTs associated with the Chamaeleon II molecular cloud. The
models that best fit the data are those where the inner radius of the disk is
larger than expected for a rim in thermal equilibrium with the photospheric
radiation field alone. In particular, we find that large inner rims are
necessary to account for the mid infrared fluxes (3.6-8.0 um) obtained by the
Spitzer Space Telescope. Finally, we argue that deriving the stellar
luminosities of cTTs by making bolometric corrections to the J-band fluxes
systematically overestimates these luminosities. The overestimated luminosities
translate into underestimated ages when the stars are placed in the H-R

addition, there is evidence for a morphological evolution of the populations of
LIRGs. Above z=0.5, roughly half of all LIRGs are spiral, the
peculiar/irregular to spiral ratio is ~0.7, and both classes span a similar
range of L_{IR} and M_B. At low-z, spirals account for one-third of LIRGs, the
peculiar to spiral fraction rises to 1.3, and for a given M_B spirals tend to
have lower IR luminosity than peculiars. Only a few percent of LIRGs at any
redshift are red early-type galaxies. For blue galaxies (U-B < 0.2), M_B is
well correlated with log(L_{IR}) with an RMS scatter (about a bivariate linear
fit) of ~0.25 dex in IR luminosity. Among blue galaxies that are brighter than
M_B = -21, 75% are LIRGs, regardless of redshift. These results can be
explained by a scenario in which at high-z, most large spirals experience an
elevated star formation rate as LIRGs. Gas consumption results in a decline of
LIRGs, especially in spirals, to lower redshifts.

measurements of the temperature anisotropy of the CMB are the anomalous
features in the 2-point angular correlation function on very large angular
scales. In particular, the $\ell = 2$ quadrupole and $\ell = 3$ octopole terms
are surprisingly planar and aligned with one another, which is highly unlikely
for a statistically isotropic Gaussian random field, and the axis of the
combined low-$\ell$ signal is perpendicular to ecliptic plane and the plane
defined by the dipole direction. Although this $< 0.1 %$ 3-axis alignment might
be explained as a statistical fluke, it is certainly an uncomfortable one,
which has prompted numerous exotic explanations as well as the now well known
``Axis of Evil'' (AOE) nickname. Here, we present a novel explanation for the
AOE as the result of weak lensing of the CMB dipole by local large scale
structures in the local universe, and demonstrate that the effect is
qualitatively correct and of a magnitude sufficient to fully explain the
anomaly.

be used for cosmological studies. Redshifts were derived either from the

present evidence that these supernovae are of Type Ia by matching to spectra of
nearby supernovae. We find that the dates of the spectra relative to maximum
light determined from this fitting process are consistent with the dates
determined from the photometric light curves, and moreover the spectral
time-sequence for SNe Type Ia at low and high redshift is indistinguishable. We
also show that the expansion velocities measured from blueshifted CaHK are

first-level quantitative comparisons we find no evidence for evolution in SNIa
properties between these low- and high-redshift samples. Thus even though our

except for PKS0941-080, which is X-ray under-luminous by about two orders of
magnitude. The comparison between the full sample of GPS galaxies with
measurements in hard X-rays and a control sample of radio galaxies rules out
intrinsic X-ray weakness as causing a lower detection rate of GPS sources in
X-ray surveys. Four out of seven GPS galaxies exhibit high X-ray column
densities, whereas for the remaining three this measurement is hampered by the
poor spectral statistics. Bearing in mind the low number statistics in both the
GPS and the control sample, the average column density measured in GPS galaxies
is larger than in FRI or Broad Line Region FR II radio galaxies, but consistent
with that measured in High-Excitation FRII galaxies. This leads to a location
the absorbing gas in an obscuring ``torus'', which prevents us from observing
the nuclear region along lines-of-sight perpendicular to the radio axis. This
interpretation is supported by the discovery of rapid (timescale ~1000 s) X-ray

the SEDs were fitted with a parabolic function to determine the synchrotron
peak frequency. We checked the dependence between luminosities at several
frequency bands and synchrotron peak frequency to test the blazar sequence
scenario, which states that the source luminosity depends on the location of
the synchrotron peak. We also calculated broad band spectral indices and
plotted them against each other and the peak frequency. The range of peak
frequencies in our study was considerably extended compared to previous
studies. There were 22 objects for which log\nu_{peak}>19. The data shows that
at 5 GHz, 37 GHz and 5500 A there is negative correlation between luminosity
and nu_{peak}. There is no significant correlation between source luminosity at
synchrotron peak and peak frequency. Several low radio luminosity-low energy
peaked BL Lacs were found. The negative correlation between broad band spectral
indices and nu_{peak} is also significant, although there is substantial
scatter. Therefore we find that neither alpha_{rx} nor alpha_{ro} can be used

conclude that the blazar sequence scenario is not valid. In all our results the

not show the zirconium enhancement (taken as a representative for the s-process

Li- and s-process-rich (S-type stars). Reasons for this unexpected result are
discussed. We conclude that metallicity is probably the main responsible for

10^(60) ergs per galaxy spacing volume, provided that acceleration mechanisms
assumed do not preferentially only accelerate ultra high energy cosmic rays
(UHECRs). This total energy is about 10^5 times the parent galactic CR or
magnetic energy. The formation energy of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at
galaxy centers, 10^(62) ergs, becomes the only feasible source. An efficient
dynamo process converts gravitational free energy into magnetic energy in an
accretion disk around a SMBH. Aided by Keplerian winding, this dynamo converts
a poloidal seed field into f-f fields, which are transported into the general
inter-galactic medium (IGM). This magnetic energy is also efficiently converted
into particle energies, as evidenced by the radiation from energetic particles.
CRs of the IGM are then the result of the continuing dissipation, in a Hubble
time, of this magnetic energy, by acceleration within the f-f fields confined
within the super-galactic walls and filaments of large scale structures. In
addition, most UHECRs are diffusively lost to the galactic voids before the GZK
attenuation time, 10^8 years and hence are lost from view. Similarly within the
galaxy we expect that the winding by accretion are the sources of galactic CR
acceleration. [edited]

polarons are simulated on a number of different Bravais lattices. The effective

compared with weak and strong coupling perturbation theory. For the Holstein
polaron, it is found that the crossover between weak and strong coupling
results becomes sharper as the coordination number is increased. In higher
dimensions, polarons are much less mobile at strong coupling, with more phonons
contributing to the polaron. The total energy decreases monotonically with
coupling. Spectral properties of the polaron depend on the lattice type
considered, with the dimensionality contributing to the shape and the
coordination number to the bandwidth. As the range of the electron-phonon
interaction is increased, the coordination number becomes less important, with
the dimensionality taking the leading role.

questions of physical interest, such as the probability of the system entering

time-ordered products of projection operators. But in reparametrization

which commute with the Hamiltonian constraint (and so respect the invariance of

theory defined in the flat multidimensional bulk. Our Universe should be
obtained as a 3-brane classical solution in this theory. The renormalizability
of the fundamental theory implies that it involves higher derivatives (HD). It
should be supersymmetric (otherwise one cannot get rid of the huge induced
cosmological term) and probably conformal (otherwise one can hardly cope with
the problem of ghosts) . We present arguments that in conformal HD theories the
ghosts (which are inherent for HD theories) might be not so malignant. In
particular, we present a nontrivial QM HD model where ghosts are absent and the
spectrum has a well defined ground state. The requirement of superconformal
invariance restricts the dimension of the bulk to be D < 7. We suggest that the
TOE lives in six dimensions and enjoys the maximum N = (2,0) superconformal
symmetry. Unfortunately, no renormalizable field theory with this symmetry is
presently known. We construct and discuss an N = (1,0) 6D supersymmetric gauge
theory with four derivatives in the action. This theory involves a
dimensionless coupling constant and is renormalizable. At the tree level, the
theory enjoys conformal symmetry, but the latter is broken by quantum anomaly.
The sign of the beta function corresponds to the Landau zero situation.

\cite{Ja,GJP}. More precisely, for a given function $u$ we ask for all
functions $v$ (called \emph{ambiguity partners}) such that the ambiguity
functions of $u$ and $v$ have same modulus. In some cases, $v$ may be given by
some elementary transformation of $u$ and is then called a \emph{trivial
partner} of $u$ otherwise we call it a \emph{strange partner}. Our focus here
is on two discrete versions of the problem. For the first one, we restrict the
problem to functions $u$ of the Hermite class, $u=P(x)e^{-x^2/2}$, thus
reducing it to an algebraic problem on polynomials. Up to some mild restriction
satisfied by quasi-all and almost-all polynomials, we show that such a function
has only trivial partners. The second discretization, restricting the problem
to pulse type signals, reduces to a combinatorial problem on matrices of a
special form. We then exploit this to obtain new examples of functions that
have only trivial partners. In particular, we show that most pulse type signals
have only trivial partners. Finally, we clarify the notion of \emph{trivial
partner}, showing that most previous counterexamples are still trivial in some
restricted sense.

  Continuation of: B. Plotkin, G. Zhitomirski, On automorphisms of categories
  of free algebras of some varieties. http://arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0501331",,,,"math.GM",,"  One of the central questions of universal algebraic geometry is: when two
algebras have the same algebraic geometry? There are various interpretations of
the sentence ""Two algebras have the same algebraic geometry"". One of these is
automorphic equivalence of algebras, which is discussed in this paper, and the
other interpretation is geometric equivalence of algebras. In this paper we
consider very wide and natural class of algebras: one sorted algebras from IBN
variety. The variety is called an IBM variety if two free algebras W(X), W(Y)
of this variety are isomorphic if and only if the powers of sets X and Y
coincide. In the researching of the automorphic equivalence of algebras we must
study the group of automorphisms of the category of the all finitely generated
free algebras of our variety and the group of its automorphisms. By [PZ,
Theorem 2], if we deal with an IBN variety of one-sorted algebras, then every
strongly stable (see Definition 3.1) automorphism of our category defines the
other algebraic structure on every algebra H of our variety, such that this
algebra with the new algebraic structure automorphically equivalent to the
algebra H (Theorem 4.1), i.e., has the same algebraic geometry. From this we
conclude the necessary and sufficient conditions for two algebras to be
automorphically equivalent. We formulate these conditions by using the notion
of geometric equivalence of algebras. It means that we reduce automorphic
equivalence of algebras to the simpler notion of geometric equivalence. This
paper is a continuation of the research which was started in [PZ].

presented group G. Specifically, we examine d_p(G_i), which is the dimension of
the first homology of G_i, with mod p coefficients. We say that a collection of
finite index subgroups {G_i} has linear growth of mod p homology if the infimum
of d_p(G_i)/[G:G_i] is positive. We show that if this holds and each G_i is
normal in its predecessor and has index a power of p, then one of the following
possibilities must be true: G is large (that is, some finite index subgroup
admits a surjective homomorphism onto a non-abelian free group) or G has
Property (tau) with respect to {G_i}. The arguments are based on the geometry
and topology of finite 2-complexes.
  This has several consequences. It implies that if the pro-p completion of a
finitely presented group G has exponential subgroup growth, then G has Property
(tau) with respect to some nested sequence of finite index subgroups. It also
has applications to low-dimensional topology. We use it to prove that a
group-theoretic conjecture of Lubotzky-Zelmanov would imply the following: any
lattice in PSL(2,C) with torsion is large.
  We also relate linear growth of mod p homology to the existence of certain
important error-correcting codes: those that are `asymptotically good', which

controls the multiplicity of a pair of modules in a family by relating the

the basic theorem in ideal theory which relates the multiplicity of an ideal to
the local degree of the map formed from the generators of a minimal reduction.
In fact, as a corollary of the theorem, we show here that for M a submodule of
finite length of a free module F over the local ring of an equidimensional
complex analytic germ, that the number of points at which a generic
perturbation of a minimal reduction of M is not equal to F, is the multiplicity
of M.

independent response functions were extracted, of which 12 were observed for
the first time. Comparisons with recent model calculations show that response
functions governed by real parts of interference products are determined
relatively well near 1.232 GeV, but variations among models is large for
response functions governed by imaginary parts and for both increases rapidly
with W. We performed a nearly model-independent multipole analysis that adjusts
complex multipoles with high partial waves constrained by baseline models.
Parabolic fits to the W dependence of the multipole analysis around the Delta
mass gives values for SMR = (-6.61 +/- 0.18)% and EMR = (-2.87 +/- 0.19)% that
are distinctly larger than those from Legendre analysis of the same data.
Similarly, the multipole analysis gives Re(S0+/M1+) = (+7.1 +/- 0.8)% at
W=1.232 GeV, consistent with recent models, while the traditional Legendre
analysis gives the opposite sign because its truncation errors are quite
severe. Finally, using a unitary isobar model (UIM), we find that excitation of
the Roper resonance is dominantly longitudinal with S1/2 = (0.05 +/- 0.01)
GeV^(-1/2) at Q^2=1. The ReS0+ and ReE0+ multipoles favor pseudovector coupling

integrating out momentum components higher than a specified cutoff scale. The
use of V_{low-k} is found to give an enhancement of the $pp\to pp\pi^0$ cross
sections over the values obtained with bare potentials. Although this
enhancement brings the calculated cross sections closer to the experimental

(1989) formula describing the aftershock rate after a mainshock as a function
of time and magnitude, on the basis of parameter estimates made in previous
works for New Zealand, Italy and California. For all of three datasets we found
that the magnitude-independent productivity a is significantly correlated with
the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law and, in some cases, with parameters p
and c of the modified Omori's law. We argued that the correlation between a and
b can be ascribed to an inappropriate definition of the coefficient of
mainshock magnitude as the correlation becomes insignificant if the latter is
assumed to be $\alpha\simeq$ 2/3b rather than b. This interpretation well
agrees with the results of direct a estimates we made, by an epidemic type
model (ETAS), from the data of some large Italian sequences. We also verified
that assuming $\alpha$ about 2/3 of the average b value estimated from Italian
sequences occurred in the time interval 1981-1996 improves the ability to
predict the behavior of most recent sequences (from 1997 to 2003). Our results
indicate a partial inadequacy of the original Reasenberg and Jones (1989)
formulation when used to forecast the productivity of future sequences. In
particular, the aftershock rates and probabilities tend to be overestimated for
stronger mainshocks and conversely underestimated for weaker ones.

cryptography offers, for the first time in human history, a provably secure way
to establish a confidential key between distant partners. Photons represent the
natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of
telecom optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm particulary
suitable for distribution over long distances. However, to store and process
quantum information, qubits could be encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb

networks made of telecom channels and alkaline memories will demand interfaces
able to achieve qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths while
preserving quantum coherence and entanglement. Here we report on a qubit
transfer between photons at 1310 and 710 nm via a nonlinear up-conversion
process with a success probability greater than 5%. In the event of a
successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between
the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1550 nm, initially entangled with the
1310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted. The corresponding
fidelity is higher than 98%.

measurements have features very different from those of single-time
measurements. First, they cannot be modelled by a classical stochastic process.
Second, they are contextual, namely they depend strongly on the specific
measurement scheme through which they are determined. We construct
Positive-Operator-Valued measures (POVM) that provide such probabilities. For
observables with continuous spectrum, the constructed POVMs depend strongly on
the resolution of the measurement device, a conclusion that persists even if we
consider a quantum mechanical measurement device or the presence of an
environment. We then examine the same issues in alternative interpretations of
quantum theory. We first show that multi-time probabilities cannot be naturally
defined in terms of a frequency operator. We next prove that local hidden
variable theories cannot reproduce the predictions of quantum theory for
sequential measurements, even when the degrees of freedom of the measuring
apparatus are taken into account. Bohmian mechanics, however, does not fall in
this category. We finally examine an alternative proposal that sequential
measurements can be modelled by a process that does not satisfy the Kolmogorov
axioms of probability. This removes contextuality without introducing
non-locality, but implies that the empirical probabilities cannot be always
defined (the event frequencies do not converge). We argue that the predictions
of this hypothesis are not ruled out by existing experimental results
(examining in particular the ""which way"" experiments); they are, however,
distinguishable in principle.
