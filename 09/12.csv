context of optically thin, hot accretion flows is investigated. In the limit of
complete coupling, we focus on the one-temperature accretion flows. Based on a
global analysis, the results are compared with two-temperature accretion flow
models and with the observations of black hole sources. Many features are quite
similar. That is, hot one-temperature solutions are found to exist for mass
flow rates less than a critical value; i.e., $\dot{M}\la 10\alpha^2\dot{M}_{\rm
Edd}$, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}= L_{\rm Edd}/c^2$ is the Eddington accretion
rate. At low mass flow rates, $\dot{M}\la 10^{-3}\alpha^2 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$,
the solution is in the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) regime. But at
higher rates, radiative cooling is effective and is mainly balanced by
advective {\em heating}, placing the solution in the regime of luminous hot
accretion flow (LHAF). To test the viability of the one-temperature models, we
have fitted the spectra of the two black hole sources, Sgr A* and XTE
J1118+480, which have been examined successfully with two-temperature models.
It is found that the one-temperature models do not provide acceptable fits to
the multi-wavelength spectra of Sgr A* nor to XTE J1118+480 as a result of the
higher temperatures characteristic of the one-temperature models. It is
concluded that the thermal coupling of ions and electrons cannot be fully
effective and that a two-temperature description is required in hot accretion
flow solutions.

the result of matter infalling directly onto the black hole, with a maximum

Galaxy produce plateaux and declines in the present day mass function (PDMF)
where the main-sequence lifetime overlaps the age and duration of the SFR
variation. These PDMF features can be misinterpreted as the form of the
intrinsic stellar initial mass function (IMF) if the star formation rate is
assumed to be constant or slowly varying with time. This effect applies to all
regions that have formed stars for longer than the age of the most massive
stars, including OB associations, star complexes, and especially galactic field
stars. Related problems may apply to embedded clusters. Evidence is summarized
for temporal SFR variations from parsec scales to entire galaxies, all of which
should contribute to inferred IMF distortions. We give examples of various star
formation histories to demonstrate the types of false IMF structures that might
be seen. These include short-duration bursts, stochastic histories with
log-normal amplitude distributions, and oscillating histories with various
periods and phases. The inferred IMF should appear steeper than the intrinsic
IMF over mass ranges where the stellar lifetimes correspond to times of
decreasing SFRs; shallow portions of the inferred IMF correspond to times of
increasing SFRs. If field regions are populated by dispersed clusters and
defined by their low current SFRs, then they should have steeper inferred IMFs
than the clusters. The SFRs required to give the steep field IMFs in the LMC

Milky Way field star IMF can be accounted for by a stochastic and bursty star
formation history.

calculating fully nonadiabatic oscillations of uniformly rotating stars, where
$m$ is an integer representing the azimuthal wave number around the rotation
axis. $R$ modes are rotationally induced, non-axisymmetric, oscillation modes,
whose oscillation frequency strongly depends on the rotation frequency $\Omega$
of the star. They are conveniently classified by using two integer indices $m$
and $l^\prime\ge |m|$ that define the asymptotic oscillation frequency
$2m\Omega/[l^\prime(l^\prime+1)]$ in the limit of $\Omega\to 0$. We find low
$m$, high radial order, odd $r$ modes with $l^\prime=m$ in SPB stars are
excited by the same iron opacity bump mechanism that excites low frequency $g$
modes of the variables, when the rotation frequency $\Omega$ is sufficiently
high. No even $r$ modes with low $m$ are found to be pulsationally unstable.
Since the surface pattern of the temperature perturbation of odd modes is
antisymmetric about the equator of the star, observed photometric amplitudes
caused by the unstable odd $r$ modes with $l^\prime=m$ are strongly dependent
on the inclination angle between the axis of rotation and the line of sight.
Applying the wave-meanflow interaction formalism to nonadiabatic $r$ modes in
rapidly rotating SPB models, we find that because of the $r\phi$ component of
the Reynolds stress and the radial transport of the eddy fluctuation of density
in the rotating star, the surface rotation is accelerated by the forcing due to
the low $l^\prime=m$ unstable $r$ modes.

spontaneously generated and in some cases are long-lived. While this scenario
presents the advantage of explaining the three observed types of warps, it also
brings new constraints on the dark matter distribution in spiral galaxies.

for periodic solutions. Due to strong fluctuations on the convective timescale
the probability of such a reversal is very small. Finally, a simple non-linear

concerned. In our analysis, the previous conclusion that the detected spectral
lags could be accounted for by the curvature effect is confirmed, while the
conclusion that the lag has no dependence on the radius of fireballs is not
true. We find that introducing extreme physical parameters is not the only
outlet to explain those observed large lags. Even for the larger lags
($\sim5s$) (see Norris et al. 2005), a wider local pulse ($\Delta
t_{\theta,FWHM} = 10^{7}s$) could account for it. Some conclusions not
presented in Shen et al. (2005) or those modified in our analysis are listed

Our morphologically selected luminosity functions are similar in both shape and
number density to other morphologically selected luminosity functions (e.g.,

is due to incompleteness from blue E/S0 galaxies, which make up to ~30% of the
sample and contamination from early-type spirals. Most of the blue E/S0
galaxies have similar structural properties to the red E/S0s and could
passively evolve to form giant red ellipticals at z=0. However, the bluest,
(U-V)_0<1.2, have much smaller Sersic parameters and would evolve into much
fainter galaxies. These may be the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals. We

Using a candidate-source catalogue derived with IBIS on INTEGRAL and a number
of sky distribution models we obtained spectra resolved in Galactic longitude.
We can identify spectral components of a diffuse continuum of power law shape
with index about 1.7, a positron annihilation component with a continuum from
positronium and the line at 511 keV, and a second, roughly power-law component
from detected point sources. Our analysis confirms the concentration of
positron annihilation emission in the inner region (|l|<10), the disk
(10<|l|<30) being at least a factor 7 weaker in this emission. The power-law
component in contrast drops by only a factor 2, showing a quite different
longitude distribution and spatial origin. Detectable sources constitute about
90% of the total Galactic emission between 20 and 60 keV, but have a steeper
spectrum than the diffuse emission, their contribution to the total emission
dropping rapidly to a small fraction at higher energies. In the SPI energy
range the flux is lower than found by OSSE, probably due to the more complete
accounting for sources by SPI. The power-law emission is difficult to explain
as of interstellar origin, inverse Compton giving at most 10%, and instead a
population of unresolved point sources is proposed as a possible origin, AXPs
with their spectra hardening above 100 keV being plausible candidates. We
present a broadband spectrum of the emission.

guaranteed while applying a limited restriction on domain size and on
constraint tightness. In that case, a threshold point can be precisely located

an exponential tree-resolution complexity. Next, a formal analysis shows that

density is integrable in the limit of vanishing brick wall thickness only for

energy tensor allowed in this background, the energy density shows a surface
contribution localized on the horizon. We point out that the usual divergences
occurring in the entropy of the thermal atmosphere are due to the assumption
that the third law of thermodynamics holds for the quantum field in the black

the branes in a five dimensional (5D) Randall-Sundrum model with two branes (at
$y_1$ and $y_2$) and $S^1/Z_2$ symmetry of the fifth dimension. The matter on
the branes is viewed as a perturbation on the vacuum metric and treated to
linear order. In previous work \cite{ad} it was seen that the trace of the
transverse part of the 4D metric on the TeV brane, $f^T(y_2)$, contributed a
Newtonian potential enhanced by $e^{2\beta y_2} \cong 10^{32}$ and thus
produced gross disagreement with experiment. In this work we include a scalar
stabilizing field $\phi$ and solve the coupled Einstein and scalar equations to
leading order for the case where $\phi_{0}^2/M_{5}^3$ is small and the vacuum
field $\phi_{0}(y)$ is a decreasing function of $y$. $f^T$ then grows a mass
factor $e^{-\mu r}$ where however, $\mu$ is suppressed from its natural value,
$\mathcal{O}(M_{Pl})$, by an exponential factor $e^{-(1+\lambda_b)\beta y_2}$,
$\lambda_b > 0$. Thus agreement with experiment depends on the interplay
between the enhancing and decaying exponentials. Current data eliminates a
significant part of the parameter space, and the Randall-Sundrum model will be
sensitive to any improvements on the tests of the Newtonian force law at
smaller distances.

- from a new point of view. In classical mechanics, an observable is
represented as a function (measurable, continuous or smooth), whereas in (von

bonded selfadjoint operator on Hilbert space. We will show in part II of this
work that there is a common structure behind these two different concepts. If
$\mathcal{R}$ is a von Neumann algebra, a selfadjoint element $A \in

$\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{P(R)})$ of the lattice $\mathcal{P(R)}$ of projections in
$\mathcal{R}$. The Stone spectrum $\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{L})$ of a general
lattice $\mathbb{L}$ is the set of maximal dual ideals in $\mathbb{L}$,
equipped with a canonical topology. $\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{L})$ coincides with
Stone's construction if $\mathbb{L}$ is a Boolean algebra (thereby ``Stone'')

nn pairs, we observed a clean back-to-back correlation coming from the two-body
decay of \Lambda p --> n p and \Lambda n --> n n, respectively. The ratio of
the nucleon pair numbers was N_{nn}/N_{np}=0.45 \pm 0.11(stat)\pm 0.03(syst) in
the kinematic region of cos(theta_{NN}) < -0.8. Since each decay mode was
exclusively detected, the measured ratio should be close to the ratio of
\Gamma(\Lambda p --> np)/\Gamma(\Lambda n --> nn).
  The ratio is consistent with recent theoretical calculations based on the
heavy meson/direct quark exchange picture.

model space in terms of the effective pairing interaction which is found in the
complementary subspace. The absolute value of the gap $\Delta$ turned out to be
very sensitive to the cutoff $K_{max}$ in the momentum space in the equation
for the effective interaction. It is necessary to take $K_{max}=160-180
fm^{-1}$ to guarantee 1% accuracy for $\Delta$. The gap equation itself is
solved directly, without any additional approximations. The solution reveals
the surface enhancement of the gap $\Delta$ which was earlier found with an
approximate consideration. A strong surface-volume interplay was found also
implying a kind of the proximity effect. The diagonal matrix elements of
$\Delta$ turned out to be rather close to the empirical values for heavy atomic
nuclei.

cellular automata (TCA) models, which are a class of computationally efficient
microscopic traffic flow models. TCA models arise from the physics discipline
of statistical mechanics, having the goal of reproducing the correct
macroscopic behaviour based on a minimal description of microscopic
interactions. After giving an overview of cellular automata (CA) models, their
background and physical setup, we introduce the mathematical notations, show
how to perform measurements on a TCA model's lattice of cells, as well as how
to convert these quantities into real-world units and vice versa. The majority
of this paper then relays an extensive account of the behavioural aspects of
several TCA models encountered in literature. Already, several reviews of TCA
models exist, but none of them consider all the models exclusively from the
behavioural point of view. In this respect, our overview fills this void, as it
focusses on the behaviour of the TCA models, by means of time-space and
phase-space diagrams, and histograms showing the distributions of vehicles'
speeds, space, and time gaps. In the report, we subsequently give a concise
overview of TCA models that are employed in a multi-lane setting, and some of
the TCA models used to describe city traffic as a two-dimensional grid of
cells, or as a road network with explicitly modelled intersections. The final
part of the paper illustrates some of the more common analytical approximations
to single-cell TCA models.

  sheath",,,"10.1103/PhysRevE.73.011917",,"physics.bio-ph",,"  We propose an elasticity theory for one and two dimensional arrays of
globular proteins for which the free energy is affected by relative position
and relative rotation between neighboring molecules. The kinematics of such
assemblies is described, the conditions of compatibility are found, a form of
the free energy is given, and formulas for applied forces and moments are
developed. It is shown that fully relaxed states of sheets consist of helically
deformed sheets which themselves are composed of helical chains of molecules in
rational directions.
  We apply the theory to the fascinating contractile deformation that occurs in
the tail sheath of the virus bacteriophage T4, which aids its invasion of its
bacterial host. Using electron density maps of extended and contracted sheath,
we approximate the domains of each molecule by ellipsoids and then evaluate our
formulas for the position and orientation of each molecule. We show that, with
the resulting kinematic description, the configurations of extended and
contracted tail sheath are generated by a simple formula. We proposed a
constrained version of the theory based on measurements on extended and
contracted sheath. Following a suggestion of Pauling [{\em Discussions of the
Faraday Society} {\bf 13}, 170-6 (1953)], we develop a simple model of the
molecular interaction. The resulting free energy is found to have a double-well
structure. Certain simple deformations are studied (tension, torsion
inflation); the theory predicts a first-order Poynting effect and some
unexpected relations among moduli. Finally, the force of penetration is given,
and a possibly interesting program of epitaxial growth and patterning of such
sheets is suggested.
