and the mass of the galaxy spheroids or bulges (or more precisely their central
velocity dispersion), suggests a common formation scenario for galaxies and
their central black holes. The growth of bulges and black holes can commonly
proceed through external gas accretion or hierarchical mergers, and are both
related to starbursts. Internal dynamical processes control and regulate the
rate of mass accretion. Self-regulation and feedback are the key of the
correlation. It is possible that the growth of one component, either BH or
bulge, takes over, breaking the correlation, as in Narrow Line Seyfert 1
objects. The formation of supermassive black holes can begin early in the
universe, from the collapse of Population III, and then through gas accretion.
The active black holes can then play a significant role in the re-ionization of
the universe. The nuclear activity is now frequently invoked as a feedback to
star formation in galaxies, and even more spectacularly in cooling flows. The
growth of SMBH is certainly there self-regulated. SMBHs perturb their local
environment, and the mergers of binary SMBHs help to heat and destroy central
stellar cusps. The interpretation of the X-ray background yields important
constraints on the history of AGN activity and obscuration, and the census of
AGN at low and at high redshifts reveals the downsizing effect, already
observed for star formation. History appears quite different for bright QSO and
low-luminosity AGN: the first grow rapidly at high z, and their number density
decreases then sharply, while the density of low-luminosity objects peaks more
recently, and then decreases smoothly.

by the coupling of the ion's internal degrees of freedom to its center-of-mass
motion. We show that He^+ in superstrong magnetic fields can produce spectral
lines with energies of up to about 3 keV, and it may be responsible for
absorption features detected recently in the soft X-ray spectra of several
radio-quiet isolated neutron stars. Quantization of the ion's motion across a
magnetic field results in a fine structure of spectral lines, with a typical
spacing of tens electron-volts in magnetar-scale fields. It also gives rise to
ion cyclotron transitions, whose energies and oscillator strengths depend on
the state of the bound ion.

as lighthouses to constrain distances in the Universe using variants of the
Baade-Wesselink method. Based on a large set of CMFGEN models (Hillier & Miller
1998) covering the photospheric phase of type II SN, we study the various
concepts entering one such technique, the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM).
We compute correction factors $\xi$ needed to approximate the synthetic
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) with that of a blackbody at temperature $T$.
Our $\xi$, although similar, are systematically greater, by $\sim 0.1$, than
the values obtained by Eastman et al. (1996). This translate into a systematic
enhancement of 10-20% in EPM-distances. We find that line emission and
absorption, not directly linked to color temperature variations, can
considerably alter the synthetic magnitude, and cause above-unity $\xi$-values.
Optically-thick lines, present in the optical at late-times, can also introduce
a strong wavelength-dependence of the photospheric radius, invalidating the use
of the Baade method. Both the impact of line-blanketing on the SED and the
photospheric radius at low $T$ suggest that the EPM is best used at early
times, when the outflow is fully ionized and line-opacity mostly confined to
the UV range. We also investigate how reliably one can measure the photospheric
velocity from P-Cygni line profiles. Contrary to the usually held belief, the
velocity at maximum absorption in the P-Cygni trough of optically-thick lines
can both {\it overestimate or underestimate} the photospheric velocity, with a
magnitude that depends on the SN outflow density gradient and the optical
thickness of the line.

$1.2<z<1.7$, implying absolute magnitudes M$_{K'}<-26.0$ and stellar masses
well in excess of 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Under the hypothesis of pure passive
evolution from $z\sim1.5$ to $z=0$, in the local universe they would have
luminosities L$_K\ge2.5$L$^*$. Thus, they are the high-z counterparts of the
local old massive (10$^{11}-10^{12}$ M$_\odot$) early-type galaxies populating
the bright end of the local luminosity function of galaxies. The comparison of
their spectro-photometric properties with a grid of synthetic models suggests
that the stellar populations in more than half of the sample are about
$\sim$3-5 Gyr old and 1-2 Gyr old in the remaining part. These ages imply
formation redshift $z_{f} > 2$ for all the galaxies and $z_{f} \geq 4$ for the

the bulk of their stellar mass at $2<z<4$, most likely over a short ($<$ 1 Gyr)

shape of xi(s) and w_p(sigma) suggests that xi(r) deviates from a simple
power-law model, with a break at ~9 h(-1) Mpc. This model is consistent with
the observed projected correlation function. However, due to the limited size
of the fields used, the w_p(sigma) results are limited to sigma < 10 h(-1) Mpc.
Assuming this double power-law model, and by analysing the shape distortions in
xi(sigma,pi), we find the following constraints: beta(z=3) = 0.15

damage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethal
levels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. The greatest damage occurs
at low to mid latitudes. We find reductions in visible sunlight of a few
percent, primarily in the polar regions. Nitrate deposition similar to or

simple analytical model that allows us to compute surprisingly accurate
predictions, when compared to our simulations, but also to other simulations
presented in Springel & Hernquist (2003). The model depends on two main
parameters: the star formation time scale t* and the wind efficiency eta_w. We
also compute, for halos of a given mass, the baryon fraction in each of the
following phases: cold disc gas, hot halo gas and stars. Here again, our
analytical model predictions are in good agreement with simulation results, if
one correctly takes into account finite resolution effect.
  We compare predictions of our analytical model to several observational
constraints, and conclude that a very narrow range of the model parameters is
allowed. The important role played by galactic winds is outlined, as well as a
possible `superwind' scenario in groups and clusters. The `anti-hierarchical'

defining and maintaining the International Celestial Reference Frame, providing
precise measurements of coordinates of extragalactic radiosources. The quest
for increasing accuracy of VLBI geodetic products has lead to a deeper revision
of all aspects that might introduce errors in the analysis. The departure of
the observed sources from perfect, stable, compact and achromatic celestial
targets falls within this category. This paper is concerned with the impact of
unaccounted frequency-dependent position shifts of source cores in the analysis
of dual-band S/X VLBI geodesy observations, and proposes a new method to
measure them. The multi-frequency phase transfer technique developed and
demonstrated by Middelberg et al. (2005) increases the high frequency coherence
times of VLBI observations, using the observations at a lower frequency. Our
proposed SOURCE/FREQUENCY PHASE REFERENCING method endows it with astrometric
applications by adding a strategy to estimate the ionospheric contributions.
Here we report on the first successful application to measure the core shift of
the quasar 1038+528 A at S and X-bands, and validate the results by comparison
with those from standard phase referencing techniques. In this particular case,
and in general in the cm-wavelength regime, both methods are equivalent.
Moreover the proposed method opens a new horizon with targets and fields
suitable for high precision astrometric studies with VLBI, especially at high

of dark energy, the source of the observed present acceleration of the
universe. High precision experiments are being developed to reduce the
uncertainties in the observations. Recently, we showed that the agreement to an
accuracy of 10% of measurements of the present density fluctuations
(\delta\rho/\rho)^2, derived from galaxy distribution (GD) data and cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in the \LambdaCDM model, puts very
strong limits on the possible decay of the vacuum energy into cold dark matter.
Using this agreement, combined with the evidence that the matter density
\Omega_M^0=0.28\pm 0.02 and that the universe is approximately flat, we show
that the vacuum metamorphosis model (VMM) and the popular brane-world model
(BWM), both used to explain dark energy, can be discarded. When we relax the
\Omega_M^0 requirement, we find that an agreement within 10% can be obtained
only with \Omega_M^0\simeq 0.36 for the VMM and \Omega_M^0\simeq 0.73 for the
BWM, both of which are not consistent with observations. The agreement of the
CMB and GD data and previous constraints from SNIa data exclude, or put strong
limits on, other dark energy models, which have been suggested, that can be
described by the parametrized equation of state (EOS) w=p/\rho= w_0 + w_a(1-a),

(\rho) is the pressure (energy density) of the dark energy. We find that the

This effect does not exist in the superconducting phase. On the other hand, if

the coupling between the plane and the chain. Starting from the two-dimensional
$t$-$t^{'}$-$J$ model and using the random-phase approximation (RPA), we find a
pronounced anisotropy of the incommensurate (IC) peaks in the spin channel,
namely the peak intensity at the $(\pi\pm\delta,\pi)$ direction is stronger
than that at the $(\pi,\pi\pm\delta)$ direction in a wide frequency range from
$\omega=0.2J$ to the resonance frequency $\omega_r=0.35J$. Above the resonance
frequency, the IC peaks reemerge. Their intensities shift to the diagonal
direction and no anisotropy exists along the two diagonal directions. We find
that this anisotropy is robust with respect to the possible variation of the
RPA correction factor and to the dopings. The charge fluctuation is also found
to be incommensurate for all energies considered and peak at $(0,\delta)$ and
$(\delta,0)$. An anisotropy in its IC peak intensity along the $k_x$ and the
$k_y$ direction exists, but in sharp contrast to the spin channel, the maximum
intensity of the IC peak is along the $k_y$ direction. Moreover, the IC peak in
the charge channel exhibits an upward dispersion, in contrast to the downward
dispersion below the spin resonance frequency for the spin IC peak. We explain
these features based on the effect of the plane-chain coupling on the topology
of the Fermi surface.

understand recent experimental results, we use the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
equations and the generalized nonlinear sigma model. An axisymmetric vortex
state, which was observed by the JILA group, can be regarded as a topologically
trivial skyrmion in the pseudospin representation. The internal, coherent
coupling between the two components breaks the axisymmetry of the vortex state,
resulting in a stable vortex molecule (a meron pair). We also mention
unconventional vortex states and monopole excitations in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate. Next, we discuss a rich variety of vortex states realized in
rapidly rotating two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. We introduce a phase
diagram with axes of rotation frequency and the intercomponent coupling
strength. This phase diagram reveals unconventional vortex states such as a
square lattice, a double-core lattice, vortex stripes and vortex sheets, all of
which are in an experimentally accessible parameter regime. The coherent
coupling leads to an effective attractive interaction between two components,
providing not only a promising candidate to tune the intercomponent interaction
to study the rich vortex phases but also a new regime to explore vortex states
consisting of vortex molecules characterized by anisotropic vorticity. A recent
experiment by the JILA group vindicated the formation of a square vortex
lattice in this system.

reasonable magnitude displaying a doping dependence similar to the one reported

of the resistivity measurements allows us to test the Wiedemann-Franz(WF) law,
the validity of which was confirmed in an overdoped sample in agreement with

resolved for samples displaying either a lower doping content or a higher

achievable rates of binary linear block codes transmitted over memoryless
binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS) channels. The lower bounds on the density
of arbitrary parity-check matrices are expressed in terms of the gap between
the rate of these codes for which reliable communication is achievable and the
channel capacity, and the bounds are valid for every sequence of binary linear
block codes. These bounds address the question, previously considered by Sason
and Urbanke, of how sparse can parity-check matrices of binary linear block
codes be as a function of the gap to capacity. Similarly to a previously
reported bound by Sason and Urbanke, the new lower bounds on the parity-check
density scale like the log of the inverse of the gap to capacity, but their
tightness is improved (except for a binary symmetric/erasure channel, where
they coincide with the previous bound). The new upper bounds on the achievable
rates of binary linear block codes tighten previously reported bounds by
Burshtein et al., and therefore enable to obtain tighter upper bounds on the
thresholds of sequences of binary linear block codes under ML decoding. The
bounds are applied to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and the
improvement in their tightness is exemplified numerically. The upper bounds on
the achievable rates enable to assess the inherent loss in performance of
various iterative decoding algorithms as compared to optimal ML decoding. The
lower bounds on the asymptotic parity-check density are helpful in assessing
the inherent tradeoff between the asymptotic performance of LDPC codes and
their decoding complexity (per iteration) under message-passing decoding.

and a result of Kolmogorov and Bardzin' on the the realizability of networks in
three dimensions. This represents an alternative to other approaches in which
some sort of correlation between field configurations helps limit the degrees
of freedom within a region. It also provides an approach to thinking about
black hole entropy in terms of states inside rather than on its surface.
Intuitively, a spin network complicated enough to imbue a region with volume
only lets that volume grow as quickly as the area bounding it.

as powers of the logarithm of the inflationary scale factor. Starobinskii's
technique of stochastic inflation not only reproduces the leading infrared
logarithms at each order in perturbation theory, it can sometimes be summed to
reveal what happens when inflation has proceeded so long that the large
logarithms overwhelm even very small coupling constants. It is thus a
cosmological analogue of what the renormalization group does for the
ultraviolet logarithms of quantum field theory, and generalizing this technique
to quantum gravity is a problem of great importance. There are two significant
differences between gravity and the scalar models for which stochastic
formulations have so far been given: derivative interactions and the presence
of constrained fields. We use explicit perturbative computations in two simple
scalar models to infer a set of rules for stochastically formulating theories
with these features.

where all the fields and particles of physics, save gravity, are confined on a
4-dimensional brane embedded in 5-dimensional anti-deSitter space. Their
scenario features a stable bound state of bulk gravity waves and the brane that
reproduces standard general relativity. We demonstrate that in addition to this
zero-mode, there is also a discrete set of metastable bound states that behave
like massive 4-dimensional gravitons which decay by tunneling into the bulk.
These are resonances of the bulk-brane system akin to black hole quasinormal
modes--as such, they give rise to the dominant corrections to 4-dimensional
gravity. The phenomenology of braneworld perturbations is greatly simplified
when these resonant modes are taken into account, which is illustrated by
considering gravitational radiation emitted from nearby sources and early
universe physics.

invariance under any monotonic transformation of the time series, has a degree
of robustness against noise, and has the adaptability of satisfying almost all
the widely accepted but conflicting criteria for complexity measurements.
Surprisingly, the measure is developed from Kolmogorov complexity, which is
traditionally believed to represent only randomness and to satisfy one
criterion to the exclusion of the others. For familiar iterative systems, our
treatment may imply a heuristic approach to transforming symbolic dynamics into
permutation dynamics and vice versa.

to azimuthal anisotropy in the local transverse momentum distribution of
quarks, as generated by their position-momentum correlations as a result of
radial flow and/or jet quenching. We find that even if quarks have large local
non-elliptic anisotropic flow, the elliptic flow of produced hadrons can still
scale with their constituent quark numbers. This scaling is, however, broken if
the radial flow of coalescing quarks is anisotropic and/or if the momentum
dispersion of quarks inside hadrons is included.
