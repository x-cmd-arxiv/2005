sample of core-dominated radio sources with a matched sample of FR I radio
galaxies. The emission lines in the core-dominated objects are on average
significantly more luminous than those in the comparison sample, inconsistent
with the simplest unified models in which there is no orientation dependence of
the line emission. However, the results are equally consistent with a scenario
in which, for the majority of objects, beaming has minimal effect on the
observed core luminosities of a large fraction of the FRI population and that
intrinsically stronger cores simply give rise to stronger emission lines. We
conclude that FRI unification is much more complex than usually portrayed, and
models combining beaming with an intrinsic relationship between core and

Best and Sari for k>5-sqrt(3/4). In addition we find new, hollow (with
evacuated interior), first type solutions that may be applicable for 4<k<17/4.
This ``sequence'' with increasing k of first type solutions, hollow first type
solutions, and then second type solutions is reminiscent of the
non-relativistic sequence. However, while in the non relativistic case there is
a range of k which corresponds to a ``gap'' - a range in $k$ with neither first

the second type solutions, here there is an ``overlap'': a range of k for which
current considerations allow for both hollow first and second type solutions.
Further understanding is needed to determine which of the two solutions apply
in this overlap regime. We provide similar exploration for the other geometries
and for imploding configurations. Interestingly, we find a gap for imploding
spherical shocks and exploding planar shocks and an overlap for imploding
planar solutions. Cylindrical configurations have no hollow solutions and
exhibit direct transition from first type to second type solutions, without a

the major principal axes of the hosts. Our analytic model implies that the

the two axis-ratios of the host halos from the best-fit values of the free

and supermassive black holes. Galactic Black Hole (GBH) power density spectra
(PDS) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. In the low/hard
state the high-frequency rollover in the PDS moves in a way which is not simply
related to luminosity. Hence this feature can only be used as an approximate
indicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in AGN. The
X-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in GBH, which is
rather stable. We show that the PDS of the Comptonized tail in GBH can be much
more variable, and that it is this which should be compared to AGN due to their
much lower disc temperature. This bandpass effect removes a problem in
interpreting the (often highly variable) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies
as the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate GBH. Additionally, we
speculate that some NLS1 (e.g. Akn 564) are counterparts of the very high
state. The Comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with PDS
which can be roughly described as band-limited noise. This shape is similar to
that seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise in
the power spectrum of an AGN does not necessarily imply low luminosity. We also
stress that Cyg X-1, often used for comparison with AGN, is not a typical black
hole system due to its persistent nature. In particular, the shape of its power
spectrum in the high/soft state is markedly different from that of other
(transient) GBH systems in this state. The fact that the NLS1s NGC 4051 and
MCG-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/soft
state of Cyg X-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation that
the Hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in AGN.

in the radial velocity which shows evidence for a long-term variability.
Furthermore, our measurements show a correlation between the variation in the
radial velocity and the asymmetry of the spectral line profile, as measured in
the bisector velocity spans. The line bisectors also show oscillations in the

galaxy angular catalogues can not be used for detecting a structure with the

extensive redshift-based 3-d maps have revealed the ``hidden'' fractal
dimension of about 2, and have confirmed superclustering at scales even up to
500 Mpc (e.g. the Sloan Great Wall). On scales, where the fractal analysis is

in the core of the Fornax cluster. Their photometric properties -- like
magnitude, colour, surface brightness -- are very similar to those of Local
Group dSphs. However, at a given total magnitude, dSphs in Fornax seem to be
more extended than their Local Group counterparts. The membership of several
dwarf galaxy candidates in Fornax has been confirmed by surface brightness
fluctuation measurements on deep wide-field images taken with the Magellan
telescope. The analysis of these images also confirms the flat faint end slope
of the luminosity function for dSphs in Fornax which contradicts the expected
large number of small dark matter halos connected to dwarf galaxies in
LambdaCDM theory. Dwarf spheroidals have also been detected in the Hydra I and
Centaurus cluster. A preliminary analysis of their photometric properties shows
that they obey similar scaling relations as their counterparts in Fornax and
the Local Group.

52 cores were detected at 850 microns at varying levels of signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 3 sigma at peak. The detected cores were split into 'bright'
cores and `intermediate' cores, depending on their peak flux density at 850
microns. Cores with peak 850 microns flux densities greater than 170 mJy/beam
were designated 'bright' (13 cores), while those flux densities below this
value were designated 'intermediate' (16 cores). This dividing line corresponds
to A_v~50 under typical assumptions. The data are combined with our previously
published ISO data, and the physical parameters of the cores, such as density
and temperature, are calculated. Detailed fitting of the bright core radial
profiles shows that they are not critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres, in agreement
with previous findings. However, we find that intermediate cores, such as B68
(which has previously been claimed to be a Bonnor-Ebert sphere), may in fact be
consistent with the Bonnor-Ebert criterion, suggesting perhaps that cores pass
through such a phase during their evolution. We make rough estimates of core
lifetimes based on the statistics of detections and find that the lifetime of a
prestellar core is roughly ~3x10^5 years, while that of a bright core is
\~1.5x10^5 years. Comparisons with some magnetic and turbulence regulated
collapse models show that no model can match all of the data. Models that are
tuned to fit the total prestellar core lifetime, do not predict the relative
numbers of cores seen at each stage.

the eight unidentified objects recently reported by the HESS collaboration as

they might be dark cosmic ray accelerators. HESS J1813-178 has a strongly

spectrum with photon index $\sim$ 1.8 and a total (galactic plus intrinsic)
absorption corresponding to N$_H$ $\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We
hypothesize that the source is a pulsar wind nebula embedded in its supernova
remnant. The lack of X/gamma-ray variability, the radio morphology and the ASCA

significance that radio-loud quasars are on average associated with black holes
of masses ~10^{8.6} M_sun, about twice as large as those measured for
radio-quiet quasars (~10^{8.3} M_sun). We also find a clear dependence of black

black holes more massive than those producing the radio-quiet case at all
sampled luminosities. On the other hand, in the case of radio-loud quasars, we
find evidence for only a weak (if any) dependence of the black hole mass on
radio power. The above findings seem to support the belief that there exists --
at a given optical luminosity -- a threshold black hole mass associated with
the onset of significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud QSOs;
however, once the activity is triggered, there appears to be very little
connection between black hole mass and level of radio output.

AEOS AO to simulate a PSF which matches the actual AO PSF in the I-band, and
show that while the older observed AEOS PSF contained several times more waffle
error than expected, improved WFR techniques noticeably improve AEOS AO
performance. We estimate the impact of these improved WFRs on H-band imaging at
AEOS, chosen based on the optimization of the Lyot Project near-infrared

the contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum from thermal electrons. We
present model calculations of the X-ray spectra resulting from injection of a
power-law energy distribution of electrons into a source with finite

lower energies only increases the relative magnitude of the thermal component
of the spectrum, because the lowest energy electrons simply join the background

at interstitial Mn_I positions act as double-donors and compensate neighboring

post-growth annealing. Our analysis suggests that there is no fundamental
obstacle to substitutional Mn_Ga doping in high-quality materials beyond our

quantum master equation of Lindblad type. Thanks to the invariance under
spatial translations, we can apply the Bloch theorem to the subsystem density
matrix and exactly diagonalize the time evolution superoperator to obtain the
complete spectrum of its eigenvalues, which fully describe the relaxation to
equilibrium. Above a critical coupling which is inversely proportional to the
size of the subsystem, the spectrum at given wavenumber contains an isolated
eigenvalue describing diffusion. The other eigenvalues rule the decay of the
populations and quantum coherences with decay rates which are proportional to
the intensity of the environmental noise. On the other hand, an analytical
expression is obtained for the dispersion relation of diffusion. The diffusion
coefficient is proportional to the square of the width of the energy band and
inversely proportional to the intensity of the environmental noise because
diffusion results from the perturbation of quantum tunneling by the
environmental fluctuations in this model. Diffusion disappears below the

discussed is that, for suitable choices of $g$, the generalized canonical
ensemble reproduces, in the thermodynamic limit, all the microcanonical
equilibrium properties of the many-body system represented by $H$ even if this
system has a nonconcave microcanonical entropy function. This is something that
in general the standard ($g=0$) canonical ensemble cannot achieve. Thus a
virtue of the generalized canonical ensemble is that it can be made equivalent
to the microcanonical ensemble in cases where the canonical ensemble cannot.
The case of quadratic $g$-functions is discussed in detail; it leads to the

polarization or tend to compensate differences in orbital occupancies, as
demonstrated by investigating a 2-band Hubbard model in the framework of

with {\it ab initio} calculations of those contributions to the crystal field
potential, which cannot be represented by the usual angular overlap model
(AOM). The enhancement leads to an improved fitting and makes the approach
intrinsically coherent. In addition, the {\it ab initio} calculations of the
main, AOM-consistent part of the crystal field potential allows one to fix the
material-specific relations for the EAOM parameters in the effective
Hamiltonian. In consequence, the electronic structure interpretation based on
EAOM can be extended to the systems of the lowest point symmetries or/and
deficient experimental data. Several examples illustrating the promising
capabilities of EAOM are given.

  The expression for the effective diffusion of an inertial, periodically

the step number diffusion which is extracted from the corresponding coarse

were based on incorrect mappings of vacuum energies, theta angles, or connected
correlators between the two theories. With the correct identifications, there
is no sign of any inconsistency. A subtle but essential feature of the

the mapping of theta parameters from parent to daughter.

response of a spontaneously spiking Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a periodic
pulsatile drive. The response as a function of drive period and amplitude is
systematically characterized. A wide range of qualitatively distinct responses
are found, including entrainment to the input pulse train and persistent chaos.
These observations are consistent with a theory of kicked oscillators developed
by Qiudong Wang and Lai-Sang Young. In addition to general features predicted
by Wang-Young theory, it is found that most combinations of drive period and
amplitude lead to entrainment instead of chaos. This preference for entrainment
over chaos is explained by the structure of the Hodgkin-Huxley phase resetting

observations are segments of the observed process considered as curves. These
curves are assumed to lie within a space of possibly inhomogeneous functions,
and the discretized times series dataset consists of a relatively small,
compared to the number of segments, number of measurements made at regular
times. We thus consider only the case where an asymptotically non-increasing
number of measurements is available for each portion of the times series. We
estimate conditional expectations using appropriate wavelet decompositions of
the segmented sample paths. A notion of similarity, based on wavelet
decompositions, is used in order to calibrate the prediction. Asymptotic
properties when the number of segments grows to infinity are investigated under
mild conditions, and a nonparametric resampling procedure is used to generate,
in a flexible way, valid asymptotic pointwise confidence intervals for the
predicted trajectories. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed functional

which arises from an assumed U(2) symmetry of the effective potential, which is
supposed to originate in isospin symmetry of the underlying nuclear
interactions. To test this claim, we perform an explicit mean-field calculation
of the effective potential of the Cooper pairs in a model with a simple
four-point pairing interaction. In the neutron star context, matter is very
neutron rich with less than 10% protons, so there is no neutron-proton pairing.
We find that under these conditions our model shows no interaction between

estimate the leading contribution beyond mean field and find that it is is
small and attractive at weak coupling.

mechanism of NN-interaction at intermediate and short ranges assuming a
formation of the six-quark bag dressed with basic meson fields such as $\pi$,
$\sigma$, $\rho$ and $\omega$ in the intermediate state. The peripheral part of
the interaction is governed by t-channel one- and two-pion exchanges described
fairly well by chiral perturbation theory. The $\sigma$-meson dressing should
be especially important for the stabilization of the bag due to a high coupling
constant of the $\sigma$-meson with the bag and also a strong interaction
between the $\sigma$-field and space symmetric quark core $|s^6[6]>$. This
stabilization of the intermediate dressed bag (which shifts the mass of the bag
downward to NN threshold) will be crucially important for the description of
$\pi$, $2\pi$, $\rho$ and $\omega$-meson production in NN-collisions, and, in
particular, for the correct description of $\pi^0$ production near threshold.
So that, we expect that the results of the present work will lead to a deeper
