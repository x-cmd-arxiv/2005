including our discovery of nine afterglows and a redshift determination for
three. These observations, supplemented by data from the literature, provide an
afterglow recovery rate of 60% in the optical/near-IR, much higher than in
previous missions (BeppoSAX, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, and IPN). The optical/near-IR
afterglows of Swift events are on average 1.7 mag fainter at t=12 hr than those
of previous missions. The X-ray afterglows are similarly fainter compared to
those of pre-Swift bursts. In the radio the limiting factor is the VLA
threshold and the detection rate for Swift bursts is similar to that for past
missions. The redshift distribution of pre-Swift bursts peaked at z~1, whereas
the five Swift bursts with measured redshifts are distributed evenly between
1.3 and 3.2. From these results we conclude that (i) the pre-Swift
distributions were biased in favor of bright events and low redshift events,
(ii) the higher sensitivity and accurate positions of Swift result in a better
representation of the true burst redshift and brightness distributions (which
are higher and dimmer, respectively), and (iii) as many as 1/3 of the bursts
can be optically dark, as a result of a high redshift and/or dust extinction.
We remark that the apparent lack of low redshift, low luminosity Swift bursts,
and the lower event rate compared to pre-launch estimates (90 vs. 150 per
year), are the result of a threshold that is similar to that of BATSE. In view
of these inferences, afterglow observers may find it advisable to make
significant changes in follow up strategies of Swift events. [abridged]

infrared (4.5 micron) flux density threshold of 3 nJy (achievable with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in a 10^5 s integration). In a hypothetical
one-year survey, it should be possible to detect up to several thousand SNe per
unit redshift at z > 6. We discuss the possible application of such a large
sample of distant SNe as a probe of the epoch of reionization. By heating the
intergalactic medium and raising the cosmological Jeans mass, the process of
reionization can suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. This could have
produced a relatively sharp drop in the SNR around the redshift of
reionization. We quantify the detectability of this feature in future surveys
of distant SNe by varying the redshift and duration of the feature, as well as
its impact on the SFR in low-mass halos, which results in different redshifts,
widths, and sizes of the drop in the expected SFR. We find that the drop can be
detected out to z_re ~ 13, as long as (i) the reionization history contains a
relatively rapid feature which is synchronized over different regions to within
\Delta z < 1 - 3, (ii) the star-formation efficiency in halos that dominate
reionization is ~ 10%, and (iii) reionization significantly suppresses the star
formation in low-mass halos. Depending on the details of (i) - (iii), this
could be achieved with a survey lasting less than two weeks. Detecting this
signature would also help elucidate the feedback mechanism that regulates
reionization.

  Absorption systems are our best probes of the gaseous content of galaxy halos
and therefore provide important constraints on models for gas cooling into

therefore are detectable in absorption systems. Detailed studies of the nature
of gas in galaxy halos using absorption systems are crucial for building a

$\rho_{DM} = B \rho_{vis}$ and show that the simple bias function $b \~1/r^{2}$

Lambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to

a peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).
These models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive
possibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state
(EOS). Most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology
(e.g. the SNAP and PLANCK projects) address very carefully the determination of
an EOS parametrized ``a la quintessence''. Here we show that by fitting
cosmological data to an EOS of that kind can also be interpreted as a hint of a
fundamental, but time-evolving, cosmological term: Lambda=Lambda(t). We
exemplify this possibility by studying the effective EOS associated to a
renormalization group (RG) model for Lambda. We find that the effective EOS can
correspond to both normal quintessence and phantom dark energy, depending on
the value of a single parameter of the RG model. We conclude that behind a
non-trivial EOS of a purported quintessence or phantom scalar field there can
actually be a running cosmological term of a fundamental quantum field theory.

present high resolution cosmological N-body simulations at high-z (z>6) which
resolve a wide range of halo mass, from minihalos to clusters of large, rare
halos. We also study how minihalos affect I-fronts, through simulations of
minihalo photoevaporation. Furthermore, we modify the I-front propagation
equations to account for evolving small-scale structure, and incorporate these
results into a semi-analytical reionization model. When intergalactic medium
clumping and minihalo clustering around sources are included, small-scale
structure affects reionization by slowing it down and extending it in time.
This helps to explain observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe,
which imply an early and extended reionization epoch. We also study how source
clustering affects the evolution and size of H II regions, finding, in
agreement with simulations, that H II regions usually expand, rarely shrinking.
Hence, ""relic H II regions'' are an exception, rather than the rule. When the
suppression of small-mass sources in already-ionized regions by Jeans-mass
filtering is accounted for, H II regions are smaller, delaying overlap. We also
present a new numerical method for radiative transfer which is fast, efficient,

it requires the estimation of the unabsorbed quasar continuum level, a
difficult undertaking subject to various sources of systematic error and bias.
We suggest an alternative approach based on measuring the one-point probability
distribution function (pdf) of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean,
relative to the mean, i.e. the pdf of delta_f = (f - <f>)/<f>. This statistic,
while sensitive to the amplitude of the ionizing background, has the virtue
that its measurement does not require an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum
level. We present a measurement of the pdf of delta_f from seven Keck HIRES
spectra, spanning a redshift range of z = 2.2 - 4.4. To illustrate that our
method is useful, we compare our measurements of the pdf of delta_f, and
measurements of the flux power spectrum from Croft et al. (2002) at z = 2.72,
with cosmological simulations. From this comparison, we obtain constraints on
the mean transmission in the Lyman-alpha forest, the slope of the

properties of the vortex system in strongly anisotropic layered superconductors
with a random array of columnar pinning centers. Our method involves numerical
minimization of a free energy functional in terms of the time-averaged local
vortex density. It yields the detailed vortex density distribution for all
local free-energy minima, and therefore allows the computation of any desired
correlation function of the time-averaged local vortex density. Results for the
phase diagram in the temperature vs. pin concentration plane at constant
magnetic induction are presented. We confirm that for very low pin
concentrations, the low-temperature phase is a Bragg glass, which melts into an
interstitial liquid phase via two first-order steps, separated by a Bose glass
phase. At higher concentrations, however, the low-temperature phase is a Bose
glass, and the melting transition becomes continuous. The transition is then
characterized by the onset of percolation of liquid-like regions across the
sample. Inhomogeneous local melting of the Bose glass is found to occur. There
is also a depinning crossover between the interstitial liquid and a completely
unpinned liquid at higher temperatures. At sufficiently large pin
concentrations, the depinning line merges with the Bose glass to interstitial
liquid transition. Many of the features we find have been observed
experimentally and in simulations. We discuss the implications of our results
for future experimental and theoretical work.

of their promise for scalability and their potential for synergetically
utilizing the available resources associated with the existing Si technology
infrastructure. Electronic and nuclear spins of shallow donors (e.g.
phosphorus) in Si are ideal candidates for qubits in such proposals due to the
relatively long spin coherence times. For these spin qubits, donor electron
charge manipulation by external gates is a key ingredient for control and
read-out of single-qubit operations, while shallow donor exchange gates are
frequently invoked to perform two-qubit operations. More recently, charge
qubits based on tunnel coupling in P$_2^+$ substitutional molecular ions in Si
have also been proposed. We discuss the feasibility of the building blocks
involved in shallow donor quantum computation in silicon, taking into account
the peculiarities of silicon electronic structure, in particular the six
degenerate states at the conduction band edge. We show that quantum
interference among these states does not significantly affect operations
involving a single donor, but leads to fast oscillations in electron exchange
coupling and on tunnel-coupling strength when the donor pair relative position
is changed on a lattice-parameter scale. These studies illustrate the
considerable potential as well as the tremendous challenges posed by donor spin
and charge as candidates for qubits in silicon.

(PY) approximation are investigated using an approach devised by X. S. Chen and
F. Forstmann [J. Chem. Phys. 97, 3696 (1992)]. This scheme hinges on a
diagonalization of the matrix of second functional derivatives of the grand
canonical potential with respect to the particle density fluctuations. The
zeroes of the smallest eigenvalue and the direction of the relative eigenvector
characterize the instability uniquely. We explicitly compute three different
classes of examples. For a symmetrical binary mixture, analytical calculations,
both for mMSA and for PY, predict that when the strength of adhesiveness
between like particles is smaller than the one between unlike particles, only a
pure condensation spinodal exists; in the opposite regime, a pure demixing
spinodal appears at high densities. We then compare the mMSA and PY results for
a mixture where like particles interact as hard spheres (HS) and unlike
particles as SHS, and for a mixture of HS in a SHS fluid. In these cases, even
though the mMSA and PY spinodals are quantitatively and qualitatively very
different from each other, we prove that they have the same kind of
instabilities. Finally, we study the mMSA solution for five different mixtures
obtained by setting the stickiness parameters equal to five different functions
of the hard sphere diameters. We find that four of the five mixtures exhibit
very different type of instabilities. Our results are expected to provide a
further step toward a more thoughtful application of SHS models to colloidal

temperature, in addition to being obtained from a power law fit, is a crossover
temperature at which there is a change in the dynamics from the high
temperature homogeneous, diffusive relaxation to a heterogeneous, hopping-like
motion. The hopping-like motion is evident in the probability distributions of
the logarithm of single-particle displacements: approaching the commonly
reported mode-coupling temperature these distributions start exhibiting two
peaks. Notably, the temperature at which the hopping-like motion appears for
the smaller particles is slightly higher than that at which the hopping-like
motion appears for the larger ones. We define and calculate a new non-Gaussian

elastic-plastic constitutive updates of the material behavior to be performed
over a small time step between updates, as dictated by the Courant condition.
Depending on the deformation conditions, the converged time step becomes short
(~$10^{-9} s$ or less). If an implicit constitutive update is applied to this
class of simulation, the benefit of the implicit update is negated, and the
integration is prohibitively slow. The present work recasts an implicit update
algorithm into an explicit form, for which each update step is five to six
times faster, and the compute time required for a plastic update approaches
that needed for a fully-elastic update. For dynamic loading conditions, the
explicit model is found to perform an entire simulation up to 50 times faster
than the implicit model. The performance of the explicit model is enhanced by
adding a subcycling algorithm to the explicit model, by which the maximum time
step between constitutive updates is increased an order of magnitude. These
model improvements do not significantly change the predictions of the model
from the implicit form, and provide overall computation times significantly
faster than the implicit form over finite-element meshes. These modifications
are also applied to polycrystals via Taylor averaging, where we also see
improved model performance.

Condensate physics is a universal description of all high energy hadronic and
nuclear interactions. It comprises classical (McLerran-Venugopalan model and
Glauber-Mueller rescatterings) and quantum evolution (JIMWLK and BK equations)
effects both in small-$x$ hadronic and nuclear wave functions and in the high
energy scattering processes. Proton-nucleus (or $d+A$) collisions present a
unique opportunity to study Color Glass Condensate predictions, since many
relevant observables in proton-nucleus collisions are reasonably
well-understood theoretically in the Color Glass Condensate approach. In this
article we review the basics of saturation/Color Glass Condensate physics and
reproduce derivations of many important observables in proton
(deuteron)--nucleus collisions. We compare the predictions of Color Glass
physics to the data generated by $d+Au$ experiments at RHIC and observe an
agreement between the data and the theory, indicating that Color Glass
Condensate has probably been discovered at RHIC. We point out further
experimental measurements which need to be carried out to test the discovery.

to solve the partial differential equation governing the transport of radiation
in an X-ray pulsar accretion column containing a radiative shock. The procedure
yields the exact solution for the Green's function, which describes the
scattering of monochromatic radiation injected into the column from a source
located near the surface of the star. Collisions between the injected photons
and the infalling electrons cause the radiation to gain energy as it diffuses
through the gas and gradually escapes by passing through the walls of the
column. The presence of the shock enhances the energization of the radiation
and creates a power-law spectrum at high energies, which is typical for a Fermi
process. The analytical solution for the Green's function provides important
physical insight into the spectral formation process in X-ray pulsars, and it
also has direct relevance for the interpretation of spectral data for these

establishment of a closed-form expression for the quadratic normalization
integrals of the orthogonal eigenfunctions, and the derivation of a new

essentially self-adjoint) and hence no boundary condition is required at the

as the exponential of a curvature of a connection. It is well known that its
cohomology class does not depend on the particular connection chosen. It has
been shown by Quillen that a connection may be perturbed by an endomorphism of
the vector bundle, such as a symbol of some elliptic differential operator.
This point of view, as we intend to show, allows one to relate Chern character
to a non-commutative sibling formulated by Connes and Moscovici. The general
setup for our problem is purely geometric. Let \sigma be the symbol of a
Dirac-type operator acting on sections of a \Z_2-graded vector bundle E. Let
\nabla be a connection on E, pulled back to T^*M. Suppose also that \nabla
respects the Z_2-grading. The object \nabla+\sigma is a superconnection on T^*M

do not seem to favor one direction of time over its opposite, the
non-decreasing entropy of macroscopic physical systems provides a unique
direction to 'the arrow of time'. This paper proposes that the directionality
of time arises from the intrinsic computational complexity of molecular
dynamics. In particular, the following question about a hard sphere gas is
proven to be Np-complete: Given a set of input signals, in which TRUE is
represented by an actual sphere trajectory and FALSE is represented by a
trajectory that is not followed because an input signal is not TRUE; a set of
'routing' spheres that follow the same trajectory for all choices of input
signals and that collide with the signal trajectories at pre-specified points;
does there exist a set of inputs that would produce a specified final
configuration? The time asymmetry arises because the computational effort, and
thus the actual time required to determine the final configuration from the
starting configuration grows only linearly with the number of particles, N, but
the computational effort required to determine the answer to the above
Np-complete problem probably grows faster than any polynomial in N. We conclude
by arguing that, as N approaches infinity, the resulting temporal asymmetry is
sufficient to justify the molecular chaos assumption (Stosszahlansatz) used in
deriving the Boltzmann equation.

with specific recipes to solve the H-J equations. We will then show how this
setting works by framing results by Veselov and Penskoi about the algebraic
integrability of the Volterra lattice within the bihamiltonian setting for
Separation of Variables.

(and the respective reaction rates) in stellar plasmas are enhanced due to
plasma screening effects. We study the impact of those effects on predictive
stellar evolution simulations for detached double-lined eclipsing binaries. We
follow the evolution of binary systems (pre-main sequence or main sequence
stars) with precisely determined radii and masses from 1.1Mo to 23Mo (from
their birth until their present state). The results indicate that all the
discrepancies between the screened and unscreened models (in terms of
luminosity, stellar radius, and effective temperature) are within the
observational uncertainties. Moreover, no nucleosynthetic or compositional
variation was found due to screening corrections. Therefore all thermonuclear
screening effects on the charged-particle nuclear reactions that occur in the
binary stars considered in this work (from their birth until their present
state) can be totally disregarded. In other words, all relevant
charged-particle nuclear reactions can be safely assumed to take place in a
vacuum, thus simplifying and accelerating the simulation processes.

glycophorin A homodimer (a paradigm for close inter-helical packing in membrane
proteins) and aquaporin (a channel protein). Our structure calculations are
based on two alternative folding schemes: a one-step simulated annealing from
an extended chain conformation, and a two-step procedure inspired by the
grid-search methods traditionally used in membrane protein predictions. In this
framework, we investigate rationales for the utilization of sparse NMR data

calculations of helical membrane proteins.

the other quantum dynamics methods, the centroid molecular dynamics and the
ring polymer molecular dynamics, become worse at lower temperature. For an
asymmetric anharmonic system, the EPAC correlation function is in very good
agreement with the exact one at $t=0$. When the time increases from zero, the
EPAC method gives good coincidence with the exact result at lower temperature.
Finally, we propose a simplified version of the EPAC method to reduce the
computational cost required for the calculation of the standard effective

evolution of dynamical systems are discussed. In the discrete-time classical
mechanics proposed here, there is an {\it arrow of time} that follows from the
fact that the replacement of the time derivative by the backward difference
operator alone can preserve the non-negativity of the phase space density. It
is seen that, even for free particles, all the degrees of freedom are {\it
correlated} in principle. The forward evolution of functions of phase space
variables by a finite number of time steps, in this discrete-time mechanics,
depends on the entire continuous-time history in the interval $[0, \infty]$. In
this sense, discrete time evolution is {\it nonlocal} in time from a
continuous-time point of view. A corresponding quantum mechanical treatment is
possible {\it via} the density matrix approach. The interference between
non-degenerate quantum mechanical states decays exponentially. This {\it
decoherence} is present, in principle, for all systems; however, it is of
practical importance only in macroscopic systems, or in processes involving
large energy changes.
