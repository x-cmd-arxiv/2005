accretion discs around black holes. We have previously studied the case of
constant distributions of specific angular momentum. In this second paper, we
investigate (i) how the size of the disc affects the oscillation
eigenfrequencies, and (ii) the effect of power-law distributions of angular
momentum on the oscillations. In particular, we compare the oscillations of the
disc with the epicyclic eigenfrequencies of a test particle with different
angular momentum distributions orbiting around the central object. We find that
there is a frequency shift away from the epicyclic eigenfrequency of the test
particle to lower values as the size of the tori is increased. We have also
studied the response of a thick accretion disc to a localized external
perturbation using non constant specific angular momentum distributions within
the disc. We find that in this case it is also possible (as reported previously
for constant angular momentum distributions) to efficiently excite internal
modes of oscillation. In fact we show here that the local perturbations excite
global oscillations (acoustic p modes) closely related to the epicyclic
oscillations of test particles. Our results are particularly relevant in the
context of low mass X-ray binaries and microquasars, and the high frequency
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in them. Our computations make use
of a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code in azimuthal symmetry, and use a
gravitational potential that mimics the effects of strong gravity.

between the left-handed and the right handed partners under the CPT

asymmetry in the Universe. If the background metric is of the rotating black
hole, i.e. the Kerr geometry, this interaction for the neutrino is non-zero.
Therefore, the dispersion energy relations for the neutrino and its

this paper, we study the Hadwiger number of the Cartesian product G [] H of
graphs.
  As the main result of this paper, we prove that mr(G_1 [] G_2) >= h\sqrt{l}(1
- o(1)) for any two graphs G_1 and G_2 with mr(G_1) = h and mr(G_2) = l. We
show that the above lower bound is asymptotically best possible. This
asymptotically settles a question of Z. Miller (1978).
  As consequences of our main result, we show the following:
  1. Let G be a connected graph. Let the (unique) prime factorization of G be
given by G_1 [] G_2 [] ... [] G_k. Then G satisfies Hadwiger's conjecture if k
>= 2.log(log(chi(G))) + c', where c' is a constant. This improves the
2.log(chi(G))+3 bound of Chandran and Sivadasan.
  2. Let G_1 and G_2 be two graphs such that chi(G_1) >= chi(G_2) >=
c.log^{1.5}(chi(G_1)), where c is a constant. Then G_1 [] G_2 satisfies
Hadwiger's conjecture.
  3. Hadwiger's conjecture is true for G^d (Cartesian product of G taken d
times) for every graph G and every d >= 2. This settles a question by Chandran
and Sivadasan (They had shown that the Hadiwger's conjecture is true for G^d if
d >= 3.)

Hartree nonlinearity that corresponds to Coulomb or Yukawa type

boson stars, we derive a sufficient condition for global-in-time existence in

rely on Strichartz type estimates, and it enables us to add external potentials

supersymmetry techniques, and existing semiclassical methods. The approach is
based on a generalization of Berry's Random Wave Model, combined with a
consistent semiclassical representation of spatial two-point correlations. We
derive closed expressions for arbitrary wavefunction averages in terms of
universal coefficients and sums over classical paths, which contain, besides
the supersymmetry results, novel oscillatory contributions. Their physical
relevance is demonstrated in the context of Coulomb blockade physics.

equations from electron theory are methodologically incorrect and lead in some
cases to a substantial error. For instance, these methods do not take into
account the existence of a macroscopic electromagnetic field EB, HB generated
by carriers of electric charge moving in a thin layer adjacent to the boundary
of the physical region containing these carriers. If this boundary is
impenetrable for charged particles, then in its immediate vicinity all carriers
are accelerated towards the inside of the region. The existence of the
privileged direction of acceleration results in the generation of the
macroscopic field EB, HB. The contributions to this field from individual
accelerated particles are described with a sufficient accuracy by the
Lienard-Wiechert formulas. In some cases the intensity of the field EB, HB is
significant not only for deuteron plasma prepared for a controlled
thermonuclear fusion reaction but also for electron plasma in conductors at
room temperatures. The corrected procedures of macroscopic averaging will
induce some changes in the present form of plasma dynamics equations. The
modified equations will help to design improved systems of plasma confinement.

The magnetic bending of the charged particle tracks allows the determination of
the electric charge and the momentum, even for particles not fully contained in

that are barely large enough to enclose the genome. In particular, in
bacteriophages, forces as high as 60 pN are encountered during packaging and
ejection, produced by DNA bending elasticity and self-interactions. The high
forces are believed to be important for the ejection process, though the extent
of their involvement is not yet clear. As a result, there is a need for
quantitative models and experiments that reveal the nature of the forces
relevant to DNA ejection. Here we report measurements of the ejection forces
for two different mutants of bacteriophage lambda, lambda b221cI26 and lambda
cI60, which differ in genome length by ~30%. As expected for a force-driven
ejection mechanism, the osmotic pressure at which DNA release is completely
inhibited varies with the genome length: we find inhibition pressures of 15 atm
and 25 atm, respectively, values that are in agreement with our theoretical
calculations.

separate measurements on single ions and photons. In addition, the current
scheme can realize the quantum information processes for ions by using linear

entanglement between two initially disentangled systems prepared as a tensor
product of thermal states, provided the initial temperature is sufficiently
low. Entanglement is determined by the Peres-Horodeckii criterion, which
establishes that a composite state is entangled if its partial transpose is not
positive. If the initial temperature of the thermal states is higher than an
upper critical value $T_{uc}$ the minimal eigenvalue of the partially
transposed density matrix of the composite state remains positive in the course
of the evolution. If the initial temperature of the thermal states is lower
than a lower critical value $T_{lc}\leq T_{uc}$ the minimal eigenvalue of the
partially transposed density matrix of the composite state becomes negative
which means that entanglement develops. We calculate the lower bound $T_{lb}$
for $T_{lc}$ and show that the negativity of the composite state is negligibly
small in the interval $T_{lb}<T<T_{uc}$. Therefore the lower bound temperature
$T_{lb}$ can be considered as \textit{the} critical temperature for the
generation of entanglement.
