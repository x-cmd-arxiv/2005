Antennae'' is hampered by extinction. We therefore used near infrared images
obtained with ISAAC at the VLT and with SOFI at the NTT to determine the recent
star formation history in this merger. In combination with archival HST data,
we determined ages, extinction and other parameters for single star clusters,
and properties of the cluster population as a whole. About 70% of the K_s-band
detected star clusters with masses >= 10^5 M_sun are younger than 10 Myrs
(approximately an e-folding time for cluster ages), which we interpret as
evidence for rapid dissolution but not free expansion. The total mass of K-band
selected clusters is about 5-10x10^8 M_sun and represents about 3-6% of the
total molecular gas. This takes into account only the detected clusters and in
view of the rapid dissolution means that this is only a lower limit to the
total mass of stars produced in clusters during the burst. Studies of cluster
formation in other galaxies recently suggested short cluster dissolution
timescales, too, which means that star formation rates may have been severely
underestimated in the past. Extinction is strongly variable and very high in
some regions, but around A_V=1.3 mag on average. Even though most clusters are
detected at least in I-band, only the information about individual cluster ages
and extinction allows to avoid uncertainties of orders of magnitude in star
formation rate estimates determined from optical fluxes. From the distribution
of individual cluster extinction vs. age, which is significantly higher for
clusters below 8-9 Myr than for older clusters, we infer that this is the time
by which a typical cluster blows free of its native dust cocoon.

the presence of `gray' dust in quasar environments. This gray dust has a
relatively flat extinction law in the UV, consistent with the theoretical
expectation of a lack of small dust grains close to a quasar. In contrast,
individual reddened quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to have steep
extinction laws in the UV, similar to that in the SMC. We analyze the method
used in determining extinction laws from composite quasar spectra in order to
resolve this discrepancy. We show that quasars reddened by SMC-type dust that
are present in quasar samples have a negative correlation between E_{B-V} and
redshift, due to selection effects. The fact that the highest redshift quasars
(which contribute to the UV part of a composite spectrum) are less extincted
leads to shallower extinction in the UV. We construct a composite quasar
spectrum from a simulated sample of quasars reddened by SMC-type dust and show
that the extinction curve derived from the composite does not recover the
intrinsic extinction law. We conclude there is no evidence of gray dust in
quasar environments.

differences of order a few percent, which may be an indication of the level to

observations is not readily reconciled with the low concentration halos
predicted by the standard CDM model. However, halo triaxiality may act to bias
the profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric mass
distribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. A
degree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the CDM structure formation, arising
from the collision-less nature of the dark matter. Here we compare the
CDM-based model predictions of triaxial halo with the precise lensing
measurements of A1689 based on the ACS/HST and Subaru data, over a wide range
of 10kpc<r<2Mpc. The model lensing profiles cover the intrinsic spread of halo
mass and shape, and are projected over all inclinations when comparing with the
data. We show that the model parameters are only weakly constrained and
strongly degenerate mainly because of the lack of information along the line of
sight. In particular, the limits on the concentration parameter become less
restrictive with increasing triaxiality. Yet, by comparing the obtained
constraints with expected probability distributions for the axis ratio and
concentration parameters computed from numerical simulations, we find that ~6%
of cluster-size halos in the CDM model can match the A1689 lensing observations
at the 2-sigma level, corresponding to cases where the major-axis of the halo
is aligned with the line of sight. Thus halo triaxiality could reduce the
apparent discrepancy between theory and observation. This hypothesis needs to
be further explored by a statistical lensing study for other clusters as well
as by complementary three-dimensional information derived using X-ray,
kinematics, and SZ effect observations.

few cluster are younger than ~5 Gyr. Our sample of globular clusters covers

photometry and astrometry using discrete Point Spread Functions are described.
A discrete Point Spread Function (PSF) is a sampled version of a continuous PSF
which describes the two-dimensional probability distribution of photons from a
point source (star) just above the detector. The shape information about the
photon scattering pattern of a discrete PSF is typically encoded using a
numerical table (matrix) or a FITS image file. Discrete PSFs are shifted within
an observational model using a 21-pixel-wide damped sinc function and position
partial derivatives are computed using a five-point numerical differentiation
formula. Precise and accurate stellar photometry and astrometry is achieved
with undersampled CCD observations by using supersampled discrete PSFs that are
sampled 2, 3, or more times more finely than the observational data. The
precision and accuracy of the MATPHOT algorithm is demonstrated by using the
C-language MPD code to analyze simulated CCD stellar observations; measured
performance is compared with a theoretical performance model. Detailed analysis
of simulated Next Generation Space Telescope observations demonstrate that
millipixel relative astrometry and millimag photometric precision is achievable
with complicated space-based discrete PSFs. For further information about

although the details of absorption versus emission are determined by the
relative populations of the 2s and 2p states. The n=2 level populations are
solved with a parameterization that allows for Lyman-alpha pumping of the 2p
states. The density of Lyman-alpha photons is set by their creation rate,
easily determined from the recombination rate, and their removal rate. Here we
suggest that the dominant removal mechanism of Lyman-alpha radiation in HII
regions is absorption by dust. This circumvents the need to solve the
Lyman-alpha transfer problem, and provides an upper limit to the rate at which
the 2p states are populated by Lyman-alpha photons. In virtually all cases of
interest, the 2p states are predominantly populated by recombination, rather
than Lyman-alpha pumping. We then solve the radiative transfer problem for the
fine structure lines in the presence of free-free radiation. In the likely
absence of Lyman-alpha pumping, the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2} lines will appear in
stimulated emission and the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2} lines in absorption. Searching
for the 9.9 GHz lines in high emission measure HII regions offers the best
prospects for detection. The lines are predicted to be weak; in the best cases,
line-to-continuum ratios of several tenths of a percent might be expected with
line strengths of tens to a hundred mK with the Green Bank Telescope.

mathematical tools: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism for the systems with
finite degree of freedom and for fields, Geometric Optics, the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation and WKB approximation, Noether theory of invariants including the
theorem on currents, four conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum
and charge), Lie algebra of angular momentum and spherical functions,
scattering theory (limiting amplitude principle and limiting absorption
principle), the Lienard-Wiechert formulas, Lorentz group and Lorentz formulas,
Pauli theorem and relativistic covariance of the Dirac equation, etc. We give a
detailed oveview of the conceptual development of the quantum mechanics, and
expose main achievements of the ``old quantum mechanics'' in the form of
exercises.
  One of our basic aim in writing this book, is an open and concrete discussion
of the problem of a mathematical description of the following two fundamental
quantum phenomena: i) Bohr's quantum transitions and ii) de Broglie's
wave-particle duality. Both phenomena cannot be described by autonomous linear
dynamical equations, and we give them a new mathematical treatment related with
recent progress in the theory of global attractors of nonlinear hyperbolic
PDEs.

$t_d \in (2 IS, 4 IS)$ (IS - iteration steps) - the system evolves toward a
unique stable equilibrium state, medium $t_d =5 IS $ or $t_d =6 IS $, the
system undergoes oscillations: stable concentration cycles appear in the

crash for most initial concentrations. However, even in the case of long delay
time the crash time may be long enough to allow observation of the system
evolution and to introduce an appropriate strategy in order to avoid the

possible to observe an ""economy resonance"" where despite a long delay time the

decade predicts several essential new dynamic regimes applicable even to the
well-known, simple population models. We show that, in an inhomogeneous
population with a distributed reproduction coefficient, the entire initial
distribution of the coefficient should be used to investigate real population
dynamics. In the general case, neither the average rate of growth nor the
variance or any finite number of moments of the initial distribution is
sufficient to predict the overall population growth. We developed methods for
solving the heterogeneous models and explored the dynamics of the total
population size together with the reproduction coefficient distribution. We
show that, typically, there exists a phase of hyper-exponential growth that
precedes the well-known exponential phase of population growth in a free
regime. The developed formalism is applied to models of global demography and
the problem of population explosion predicted by the known hyperbolic formula
of world population growth. We prove here that the hyperbolic formula presents
an exact solution to the Malthus model with an exponentially distributed
reproduction coefficient and that population explosion is a corollary of
certain implicit unrealistic assumptions. Alternative models of world
population growth are derived; they show a notable phenomenon, a transition
from protracted hyperbolical growth (the phase of hyper-exponential
development) to the brief transitional phase of exponential growth and,
subsequently, to stabilization. The model solutions are consistent with real
data and produce relatively accurate forecasts.

instead of continuous wave fields drastically improves the degree of quadrature
integral squeezing in an optical parametric oscillator. These results
particularly allow for applications in time-resolved quantum communication
protocols.
