  correction is made in this version at the very beginning of subsection 4.3","AIP Conf.Proc.822:187-199,2006","10.1063/1.2189136",,"astro-ph",,"  If gravitons are super-strong interacting particles and the low-temperature
graviton background exists, the basic cosmological conjecture about the
Dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false: a full magnitude of cosmological
redshift would be caused by interactions of photons with gravitons.
Non-forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional
relaxation of any photonic flux that gives a possibility of another
interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. These facts may
implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm. Some
features of a new paradigm are discussed. In a frame of this model, every
observer has two different cosmological horizons. One of them is defined by
maximum existing temperatures of remote sources - by big enough distances, all
of them will be masked with the CMB radiation. Another, and much smaller, one
depends on their maximum luminosity - the luminosity distance increases with a
redshift much quickly than the geometrical one.
  If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the
nature, then an existence of black holes contradicts to the equivalence
principle. In this approach, the two fundamental constants - Hubble's and
Newton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The theoretical value
of the Hubble constant is computed. Also, every massive body would be
decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the
Pioneer 10 anomaly.

only the event statistics of flares already observed. The method is simple,
objective, and makes few ad hoc assumptions. It is argued that this approach
should be used to provide a baseline prediction for certain space weather
purposes, upon which other methods, incorporating additional information, can
improve. A practical implementation of the method for whole-Sun prediction of
Geostationary Observational Environment Satellite (GOES) events is described in
detail, and is demonstrated for 4 November 2003, the day of the largest
recorded GOES flare. A test of the method is described based on the historical
record of GOES events (1975-2003), and a detailed comparison is made with US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predictions for
1987-2003. Although the NOAA forecasts incorporate a variety of other
information, the present method out-performs the NOAA method in predicting mean
numbers of event days, for both M-X and X events. Skill scores and other
measures show that the present method is slightly less accurate at predicting
M-X events than the NOAA method, but substantially more accurate at predicting
X events, which are important contributors to space weather.

or Pd), CeAgSb2 is special due to its complex magnetic ground state, which
exhibits both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic character below an ordering
temperature TO ~ 9.8 K. To further elucidate a description this magnetic ground
state, we have carried out a systematic study of single crystalline CeAgSb2 by
magnetic, electrical magneto-transport, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) studies
over a broad range of temperature and magnetic field. We have constructed the
magnetic phase diagram based solely on magnetoresistance data. Here, depending
on the orientation of the magnetic field H, either ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic ordering occurs below TO. The resistivity of this compound
below TO does not follow a simple Fermi liquid behavior, but requires an
additional contribution from conduction electron scattering from boson
excitations with an energy gap, D. At zero field the temperature dependent
resistivity below TO is most consistent with antiferromagnetic order, based on
the transport theory which includes magnon scattering. Crystal field effect
theory applied to the susceptibility data yields splitting energies from the
ground state to the first and second excited states of 53 K and 137 K,
respectively. Although there is some uncertainty in the Kondo temperature
determination, we estimate TK ~ 23 K from our analysis. In the Fermi surface
studies, the measurements show very small Fermi surface sections, not predicted
by band structure calculations, and the SdH amplitudes are very sensitive to
field direction. Only by considering lens orbits between the main Fermi surface
cylinders can the SdH results be reconciled with the Fermi surface topology
predicted from band structure.

$\nabla_k$ term or intraband transition leads to the break of the overall
permutation symmetry in $\chi^{(3)}$ even for the low frequency and
non-resonant regions. Hence it breaks the Kleinman symmetry that is directly
based on the overall permutation symmetry. Our calculations provide a clear
understanding of the Kleinman symmetry breaks that are widely observed in many
experiments. We also suggest a feasible experiment on $\chi^{(3)}$ to test the
validity of overall permutation symmetry and our theoretical prediction.
Finally, our calculations show the following trends for the various third-order
nonlinear optical processes in the low frequency and non-resonant region:

the existence of a thermal atmosphere is a direct concomitant of the thermal
radiation of black holes when the temperature of the hole is greater than that

the equivalence of the two in various formulations of the quantum Hall physics.
We present an extension of the noncommutative Chern-Simons Matrix theory which
contains independent degrees of freedom (fields) for particles and quasiholes.
The BPS configurations of our model, which is a model with explicit
particle-quasihole symmetry, are in one-to-one correspondence with the 1/2 BPS
states in the N=4 SYM. Within our model we shed light on some less clear
aspects of the physics of the N=4 theory in the 1/2 BPS sector, like the giant
dual-giant symmetry, stability of the giant gravitons, and stringy exclusion
principle and possible implications of the (fractional) quantum Hall effect for
the AdS/CFT correspondence.

from string theory namely, by generalising the notion of $D$-branes in $G$ to
allow subsets of $G$ that are the image of a $G$-valued moment map we can
define a `fusion of $D$-branes' and a map to the Verlinde ring of the loop

the theorem of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman. The case where $G$ is not simply

reversed magnetic shear and sheared flow, which may play a role in the
formation of internal transport barriers (ITBs), within the framework of
two-fluid model. The study is based on exact self-consistent solutions in
cylindrical geometry by means of which the impact of the magnetic shear, s, and
the ""toroidal"" (axial) and ""poloidal"" (azimuthal) ion velocity components on
the radial electric field, its shear and the shear of the ExB velocity is
examined. For a wide parametric regime of experimental concern it turns out
that the contributions of the toroidal and poloidal velocity and pressure
gradient terms to the electric field, its shear and ExB velocity shear are of
the same order of magnitude. The impact of s on ExB velocity shear through the
pressure gradient term is stronger than that through the velocity terms. The
results indicate that, alike MHD, the magnetic shear and the sheared toroidal
and poloidal velocities act synergetically in producing electric fields and
therefore ExB velocity shear profiles compatible with ones observed in
discharges with ITBs; owing to the pressure gadient term, however, the impact
of s on the electic field, its shear and the shear of ExB velocity is stronger
than that in MHD.
