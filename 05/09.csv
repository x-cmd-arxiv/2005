the GRB rate, and the nature of Type Ib/Ic supernovae. We briefly mention a
number of the physical models that have been proposed to explain XRFs. We then
consider two fundamentally different classes of phenomenological jet models:
universal jet models, in which it is posited that all GRBs jets are identical
and that differences in the observed properties of the bursts are due entirely
to differences in the viewing angle; and variable-opening angle jet models, in
which it is posited that GRB jets have a distribution of jet opening angles and
that differences in the observed properties of the bursts are due to
differences in the emissivity and spectra of jets having different opening
angles. We consider three shapes for the emissivity as a function of the
viewing angle theta_v from the axis of the jet: power-law, top hat (or
uniform), and Gaussian (or Fisher). We then discuss the effect of relativistic
beaming on each of these models. We show that observations can distinguish

and \fvar, calculated using 500 s long segments of the light curves, is smaller
than the scatter expected for red noise variability. This alone does not imply
that the underlying process responsible for the variability of the source is
stationary, since the real changes of the individual variance estimates are
possibly smaller than the large scatters expected for a red noise process. In
fact the averaged \xs and \fvar, reducing the fluctuations of the individual
variances, chang e with time, indicating non-stationary variability. Moreover,
both the averaged \sqxs (absolute rms variability amplitude) and \fvar show
linear correlation with source flux but in an opposite sense: \sqxs correlates
with flux, but \fvar anti-correlates with flux. These correlations suggest that
the variability process of the source is strongly non-stationary as random
scatters of variances should not yield any correlation. \fvar spectra were
constructed to compare variability amplitudes in different energy bands. We
found that the fractional rms variability amplitude of the source, when
significant variability is observed, increases logarithmically with the photon
energy, indicating significant spectral variability. The point-to-point
variability amplitude may also track this trend, suggesting that the slopes of
the power spectral density of the source are energy-independent. Using the
normalized excess variance the black hole mass of \pks was estimated to be
about $1.45 \times 10^8 M_{\bigodot}$. This is compared and contrasted with the

A star forming region. Four main flows have been identified: three pointing in
the SW, NE, and SE directions and accelerating high density CS clumps. The
fourth outflow, revealed by high-sensitivity HDO observations, is pointing
towards South and is associated with conditions particularly favourable to a
chemical enrichment. The analysis of the line profiles shows that the SiO
molecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitation
conditions, confirming its close association with shocks. H2S, SO2, and SO
preferentially trace more quiescent regions than SiO, and in particular a lack
of bright H2S emission at the highest velocities is found. OCS and H2CS emit at
quite high velocities, where the abundances of three shock tracers like SiO,
CH3OH, and HDO are higher. These results may indicate that H2S is not the only
major sulphur carrier in the grain mantles, and that OCS and H2CS may probably
play an important role on the grains; or that alternatively they rapidly form
once the mantle is evaporated after the passage of a shock. Finally, the
outflow peak emission has been compared with recent time-dependent sulphur
chemistry models: the results indicate that, if associated with accurate
measurements of the physical conditions, the CH3OH/H2CS column density ratio
can be used as an effective chemical clock to date the age of shocked gas.

and two massive planets is modeled semi-analytically in the frame of the
general three-body problem. The main dynamical features of the system are
presented in geometrical pictures allowing us to investigate a large domain of
the phase space of this problem without time-expensive numerical integrations
of the equations of motion and without any restriction on the magnitude of the
planetary eccentricities, inclinations and mutual distance. Several regimes of
motion of the system are observed. With respect to the secular angle
$\Delta\varpi$, possible motions are circulations, oscillations (around 0 and
$180^\circ$), and high eccentricity/inclination librations in secular
resonances. With respect to the arguments of pericenter, $\omega_1$ and
$\omega_2$, possible motions are direct circulation and high-inclination
libration around $\pm 90^\circ$ in the Lidov-Kozai resonance. The regions of
transition between domains of different regimes of motion are characterized by
chaotic behavior.
  We apply the analysis to the case of the two outer planets of the $\upsilon$
Andromedae system, observed edge-on. The topology of the 3--D phase space of
this system is investigated in detail by means of surfaces of section, periodic
orbits and dynamical spectra, mapping techniques and numerical simulations. We
obtain the general structure of the phase space, and the boundaries of the
spatial secular stability. We find that this system is secularly stable in a
large domain of eccentricities and inclinations.

spin splitting in the valence band. The binding energy and spontaneous
magnetization of quantum dots oscillate with the number of particles and
reflect the shell structure. Due to the Coulomb interaction, the maximum
binding energy and spin polarization of magnetic polarons occur in the regime
of Hund's rule when the total spin of holes in a quantum dot is maximum. With
increasing number of particles in a quantum dot and for certain orbital
configurations, the ferromagnetic state becomes especially stable or may have
broken symmetry. In quantum dots with a strong ferromagnetic interaction, the
ground state can undergo a transition from a magnetic to a nonmagnetic state
with increasing temperature or decreasing exchange interaction. The
characteristic temperature and fluctuations of magnetic polarons depend on the

study on the case when the vapor and crystal phases are stable and can coexist

examine the most fundamental process of the growth of a composite nucleus which
consists of a circular core of one phase surrounded by a circular layer of
second phase embedded in a third phase. We found that there is one special
configuration that consists of a core stable phase surrounded by another stable
phase in a metastable liquid environment which becomes stationary and stable.
Then, the nucleus does not grow and the metastable liquid survives. The
macroscopic liquid phase does not disappear even though it is thermodynamically
metastable. This result seems compatible to the argument of kinetics of phase

sector of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Rather, LQC consists of a truncation of
the phase space of classical General Relativity to spatially homogeneous
situations which is then quantized by the methods of LQG. Thus, LQC is a
quantum mechanical toy model (finite number of degrees of freedom) for LQG(a
genuine QFT with an infinite number of degrees of freedom) which provides
important consistency checks. However, it is a non trivial question whether the
predictions of LQC are robust after switching on the inhomogeneous fluctuations
present in full LQG. Two of the most spectacular findings of LQC are that 1.
the inverse scale factor is bounded from above on zero volume eigenstates which
hints at the avoidance of the local curvature singularity and 2. that the
Quantum Einstein Equations are non -- singular which hints at the avoidance of
the global initial singularity. We display the result of a calculation for LQG
which proves that the (analogon of the) inverse scale factor, while densely
defined, is {\it not} bounded from above on zero volume eigenstates. Thus, in
full LQG, if curvature singularity avoidance is realized, then not in this
simple way. In fact, it turns out that the boundedness of the inverse scale
factor is neither necessary nor sufficient for curvature singularity avoidance
and that non -- singular evolution equations are neither necessary nor
sufficient for initial singularity avoidance because none of these criteria are
formulated in terms of observable quantities.After outlining what would be
required, we present the results of a calculation for LQG which could be a
first indication that our criteria at least for curvature singularity avoidance
are satisfied in LQG.

the type II target superspace. This geometry is constrained by the requirement
of kappa-symmetry on the boundary together with the use of the equations of
motion for the fermions. There are two constraints which are formally similar
to those that arise in the abelian case but which differ because of the
dependence on the additional coordinates. The model, when quantised, would be a

  lattice dynamics","special issue on ""Kinetic Theory"", Journal of Statistical Physics,
  improved version",,"10.1007/s10955-005-8088-5",,"math-ph math.MP",,"  For low density gases the validity of the Boltzmann transport equation is
well established. The central object is the one-particle distribution function,
$f$, which in the Boltzmann-Grad limit satisfies the Boltzmann equation. Grad
and, much refined, Cercignani argue for the existence of this limit on the
basis of the BBGKY hierarchy for hard spheres. At least for a short kinetic
time span, the argument can be made mathematically precise following the
seminal work of Lanford. In this article a corresponding programme is
undertaken for weakly nonlinear, both discrete and continuum, wave equations.
Our working example is the harmonic lattice with a weakly nonquadratic on-site
potential. We argue that the role of the Boltzmann $f$-function is taken over
by the Wigner function, which is a very convenient device to filter the slow
degrees of freedom. The Wigner function, so to speak, labels locally the
covariances of dynamically almost stationary measures. One route to the phonon
Boltzmann equation is a Gaussian decoupling, which is based on the fact that
the purely harmonic dynamics has very good mixing properties. As a further
approach the expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams is outlined. Both methods
are extended to the quantized version of the weakly nonlinear wave equation.
  The resulting phonon Boltzmann equation has been hardly studied on a rigorous
level. As one novel contribution we establish that the spatially homogeneous
stationary solutions are precisely the thermal Wigner functions. For three
phonon processes such a result requires extra conditions on the dispersion law.
We also outline the reasoning leading to Fourier's law for heat conduction.

In the case of the Burgers equation, the spontaneously generated wave is also a

wave is constructed from new (non-KdV) solitons that undergo an elastic
collision around the origin. Their amplitudes have opposite signs, which they
exchange upon collision. The perturbation then contains terms, which represent
coupling between the solution and these spontaneously generated waves. Whereas

for particular subvarieties in the parameter space. On these subvarieties, the
iterates of the critical set have a polynomial growth in the \emph{degrees of
the parameters}, while one has an exponential growth out of these subspaces.
The analysis of our birational transformation in $ CP_2$ is first carried out
using Diller-Favre criterion in order to find the complexity reduction of the
mapping. The integrable cases are found. The identification between the
complexity growth and the topological entropy is, one more time, verified. We
perform plots of the post-critical set, as well as calculations of Lyapunov
exponents for many orbits, confirming that generically no meromorphic two-form
can be preserved for this mapping. These birational transformations in $ CP_2$,
which, generically, do not preserve any meromorphic two-form, are extremely
similar to other birational transformations we previously studied, which do
preserve meromorphic two-forms. We note that these two sets of birational
transformations exhibit totally similar results as far as topological
complexity is concerned, but drastically different results as far as a more
``probabilistic'' approach of dynamical systems is concerned (Lyapunov
exponents). With these examples we see that the existence of a preserved
meromorphic two-form explains most of the (numerical) discrepancy between the
topological and probabilistic approach of dynamical systems.

The many-particle friction matrix in this system is evaluated using our novel
numerical algorithm based on transformations between Cartesian and spherical
representations of Stokes flow. The Cartesian representation is used to
describe the interaction of the fluid with the walls and the spherical
representation is used to describe the interaction with the particles. The
transformations between these two representations are given in a closed form,
which allows us to evaluate the coefficients in linear equations for the
induced-force multipoles on particle surfaces. The friction matrix is obtained
from these equations, supplemented with the superposition lubrication
corrections. We have used our algorithm to evaluate the friction matrix for a
single sphere, a pair of spheres, and for linear chains of spheres. The
friction matrix exhibits a crossover from a quasi-two-dimensional behavior (for
systems with small wall separation H) to the three-dimensional behavior (when
the distance H is much larger than the interparticle distance L). The crossover
is especially pronounced for a long chain moving in the direction normal to its
orientation and parallel to the walls. In this configuration, a large pressure
buildup occurs in front of the chain for small values of the gapwidth H, which
results in a large hydrodynamic friction force. A standard wall superposition
approximation does not capture this behavior.

the present author developed a fractional Laplacian wave equation to accurately
model the power law dissipation, which can be further reduced to the fractional

distribution theory. Consequently, the parameters y is found to be the Levy
stability index, which is known bounded within 0<y\le2. This finding first

torsional waves. In general, torsional standing waves have higher fundamental
frequencies than do transverse standing waves, and there is generally no
harmonic relationship between them. Although torsional waves have little direct
acoustic effect, the motion of the bow-string contact depends on the sum of the
transverse speed v of the string plus the radius times the angular velocity
(rw) . Consequently, in some bowing regimes, torsional waves could introduce
non-periodicity or jitter to the transverse wave. The ear is sensitive to
jitter so, while quite small amounts of jitter are important in the sounds of
(real) bowed strings, modest amounts of jitter can be perceived as unpleasant
or unmusical. It follows that, for a well bowed string, aperiodicities produced
in the transverse motion by torsional waves (and other effects) must be small.
Is this because the torsional waves are of small amplitude or because of strong
coupling between the torsional and transverse waves? We measure the torsional
and transverse motion for a string bowed by an experienced player over a range
of tunings. The peaks in (rw), which occur near the start and end of the stick
phase in which the bow and string move together, are only several times smaller
than v during this phase.

spin fulfill a sum rule that explicitly relates them to the corresponding
geometric phase of the whole system. The marginal geometric phases in the
Zeeman and Paschen-Back limit are analyzed. We point out the existence of nodal
points in the marginal phases that may be detected by topological means.

"quant-ph/0505059","Patrick Van Esch","Patrick Van Esch","On the Everett programme and the Born rule","7 pages, no figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Proponents of the Everett interpretation of Quantum Theory have made efforts
to show that to an observer in a branch, everything happens as if the
projection postulate were true without postulating it. In this paper, we will
indicate that it is only possible to deduce this rule if one introduces another
postulate that is logically equivalent to introducing the projection postulate
as an extra assumption. We do this by examining the consequences of changing
the projection postulate into an alternative one, while keeping the unitary
part of quantum theory, and indicate that this is a consistent (although
strange) physical theory.

two-valued measurements and a high-dimensional convex polytope called the cut
polytope in polyhedral combinatorics. Using this relation, we propose a method,
triangular elimination, to derive tight Bell inequalities from facets of the
cut polytope. This method gives two hundred million inequivalent tight Bell
inequalities from currently known results on the cut polytope. In addition,
this method gives general formulas which represent families of infinitely many
Bell inequalities. These results can be used to examine general properties of
Bell inequalities.
