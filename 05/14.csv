In these clusters, three types of objects are identified. The first type (38
objects) consists of ``naked'' OB stars whose K-band spectra are dominated by
photospheric emission. We classify the K-band spectra of the OB-type cluster
members using near-infrared classification criteria. The spectral
classification provides an important constraint on the distance to the embedded
cluster. The ionising power of the population thus derived is compared to the
information obtained from the infrared and radio flux of these sources. In most
cases these two different determinations of the ionising flux are consistent,
from which we conclude that we have identified the ionising star(s) in about
50% of the embedded clusters. The second type (7 objects) are point sources
associated with UCHII radio emission, that exhibit nebular emission lines in
the near-infrared. Six of the objects in this group produce HeI emission
indicative of an embedded O-type star. These objects are more embedded than the
OB stars and probably do not dominate the infrared flux as measured by IRAS.
The third type (20 objects) is characterised by broad (100--200 km/s) Brgamma
emission and no photospheric absorption profiles. Bik et al (2005) show that
these objects are massive YSO candidates surrounded by dense circumstellar

by driven collisionless reconnection. Outside of the light cylinder, the star's
rotation acts to wind up the magnetic field to form a predominantly azimuthal,
slowly decreasing with distance, magnetic field of opposite polarity on either
side of the equatorial plane normal to the star's rotation axis. The magnetic
field annihilates across the equatorial plane with the magnetic energy going to
accelerate the charged particles to relativistic energies. For a typical
supersonically moving pulsar, the star's wind extends outward to the standoff
distance with the interstellar medium. At larger distances, the power output of
pulsar's wind $\dot{E}_w$ of electromagnetic field and relativistic particles
is {\it redirected and collimated into the magnetotail} of the star. In the
magnetotail it is proposed that equipartition is reached between the magnetic
energy and the relativistic particle energy. For such conditions, synchrotron
radiation from the magnetotails may be a significant fraction of $\dot{E}_w$
for high velocity pulsars. An equation is derived for the radius of the
magnetotail $r_m(z^\prime)$ as a function of distance $z^\prime$ from the star.
For large distances $z^\prime$, of the order of the distance travelled by the

and generalizing to many respects a procedure conceived by Thuan & Gott (1975).
The dependence of the limiting axis ratios, below which no configuration is
allowed for the sequence under consideration, on the change in mass, total
energy, and angular momentum, during the evolution, is illustrated in some
representative situations. The dependence of axis ratios and rotation
parameters on an additional parameter, related to the initial conditions of the

Within the range of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter, inferred from
high-resolution numerical simulations, the shape of dark matter haloes is
mainly decided by the amount of anisotropy in residual velocity distribution.
On the other hand, the contribution of rotation has only a minor effect on the
meridional plane, and no effect on the equatorial plane, as bifurcation points
occur for larger values of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter. To this respect,
dark matter haloes are found to resemble giant elliptical galaxies.

collapse, and the virialization of a two-component system, made of matter and
dark energy. We compare two approaches in previous studies. The first assumes
that only the matter component virializes, e.g. as in the case of a classic
cosmological constant. The second approach allows the full system to virialize
as a whole. We show that the two approaches give fundamentally different
results for the final state of the system. This might be a signature
discriminating between the classic cosmological constant which cannot virialize
and a dynamical dark energy mimicking a cosmological constant. This signature
is independent of the measured value of the equation of state. An additional
issue which we address is energy non-conservation of the system, which
originates from the homogeneity assumption for the dark energy. We propose a
way to take this energy loss into account.

the GRB pulses which are consequences of the curvature effect, the difference
of the local pulse width might lead to the variation of the power law index,
where the smaller the width the larger the value of $\alpha$. Since the number
of sources employed in this analysis is small, our result is only a preliminary
one which needs to be confirmed by larger samples.

that in general tunneling occurs in a resonant way, the resonances being
associated with degeneracies of the approximate levels in the two separated
wells. If the nonzero momentum modes of the quantum field are excited only
weakly, the phenomena resemble those of quantum mechanics with the wave
function of the zero mode oscillating forth and back between the wells. If the
nonzero momentum modes are excited efficiently, they react back onto the zero
mode causing an effective dissipation. In some region of parameter space this
back-reaction causes the potential barrier to disappear temporarily or
definitely, the tunneling towards the ``true vacuum'' is then replaced by a
sliding of the wave function.

does not carry the indicated immunity it is suggested that the Lie algebra for
the interface of the gravitational and quantum realms (IGQR) is its stabilized
form. It carries three additional parameters: a length scale pertaining to the
Planck/unification scale, a second length scale associated with cosmos, and a
new dimensionless constant. Here, I show that the adoption of the stabilized
Poincare'-Heisenberg algebra (SPHA) for the IGQR has the immediate implication
that `point particle' ceases to be a viable physical notion. It must be
replaced by objects which carry a well-defined, representation space dependent,
minimal spatio-temporal extent. The ensuing implications have the potential,
without spoiling any of the successes of the standard model of particle
physics, to resolve the cosmological constant problem while concurrently
offering a first-principle hint as to why there exists a coincidence between
cosmic vacuum energy density and neutrino masses. The main theses which the
essay presents is the following: an extension of the present-day physics to a
framework which respects SPHA should be seen as the most natural and systematic
path towards gaining a deeper understanding of outstanding questions, if not

conformally compactified Minkowski space $\widetilde\M$. Ward's ASDYM twistor
construction is adapted to this geometry by using a correspondence between
points of $\widetilde\M$ and holomorphic discs in $\CP^3$, twistor space, with
boundary on the real slice $\RP^3$. A 1-1 correspondence is obtained between
smooth global $\U(n)$ solutions to the ASDYM equations on $\widetilde\M$ and
pairs consisting of an arbitrary holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over $\CP^3$
together with a smooth positive definite hermitian metric $H$ on $E|_{\RP^3}$.
There are no topological or other restrictions on the bundle $E$. The
description generalises the result of the scattering transform for 1+1
dimensional integrable systems in which solutions are encoded into a
combination of algebraic data, here $E$, and a reflection coefficient, here
$H:\RP^3\to E\otimes\bar E$. For trivial $E$, the twistor data consists of the
smooth Hermitian matrix function $H$ on $\RP^3$ up to constants; the
correspondence then provides a nonlinear generalisation of the X-ray transform.
Explicit examples are given with different topologies of $E$.
  A scattering problem for ASDYM fields in split signature is set up and it is
shown that sufficiently small data at past infinity uniquely determines data at
future infinity by taking a family of holonomies followed by a sequence of two
Birkhoff factorizations. The scattering map is simple on the holonomies, but
non-trivial at the level of the connection in the non-abelian case.

  Let k be a number field, let C be a smooth, projective and geometrically
integral k-curve and let p:X --> C be a Severi-Brauer k-fibration of squarefree
index. Various authors have studied the cokernel of the natural map
CH_{0}(X/C)-->\bigoplus_{v}CH_{0}(X_{v}/C_{v}), where CH_{0}(X/C) is the kernel
of p_{*}:CH_{0}(X)-->CH_{0}(C). In this paper I obtain an exact sequence which
relates the Tate-Shafarevich group of the kernel of the above map to the
Tate-Shafarevich group of the Neron-Severi torus of X. I then obtain conditions
under which these two groups agree.

space of configurations of $n$ distinct points on affine $d$-space modulo
translation and homothety. The points in the boundary correspond to $n$-pointed
stable rooted trees of $d$-dimensional projective spaces, which for $d = 1$,
are $(n+1)$-pointed stable rational curves. In particular, $T_{1,n}$ is
isomorphic to $\bar{M}_{0,n+1}$, the moduli space of such curves. The variety
$T_{d,n}$ shares many properties with $\bar{M}_{0,n}$. For example, as we
prove, the boundary is a smooth normal crossings divisor whose components are
products of $T_{d,i}$ for $i < n$, it has an inductive construction analogous
to but differing from Keel's for $\bar{M}_{0,n}$ which can be used to describe
its Chow groups, Chow motive and Poincar\'e polynomials, generalizing
\cite{Keel,Man:GF}. We give a presentation of the Chow rings of $T_{d,n}$,
exhibit explicit dual bases for the dimension 1 and codimension 1 cycles. The
variety $T_{d,n}$ is embedded in the Fulton-MacPherson spaces $X[n]$ for
\textit{any} smooth variety $X$ and we use this connection in a number of ways.
For example, to give a family of ample divisors on $T_{d,n}$ and to give an
inductive presentation of the Chow groups and the Chow motive of $X[n]$

  in v. 1); reworded and reformatted most of the manuscript",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.GN",,"  The transcription of DNA into mRNA is initiated and aided by a number of
transcription factors (TFs), proteins with DNA-binding regions that attach
themselves to binding sites in the DNA (transcription factor binding sites,
TFBSs). As it has become apparent that both TFs and TFBSs are highly variable,
tools are needed to quantify the strength of the interaction resulting from a
certain TF variant binding to a certain TFBS. We used a simple way to predict
interactions between protein and DNA: given experimental cases from the
literature where the interaction strength between two sequences has been
quantified, we created training vectors for rule induction by regarding each
amino acid and nucleotide position as a single feature in the example vector.
The resulting interaction strength was used as the target class or value. These
training vectors were then used to build a rule induction model. We applied the
rule induction method to three protein families - transcription factors from
the NF-kappaB, the early-growth-response (EGR), and the paired domain groups -
and their corresponding DNA targets. These three prediction problems increase
in complexity with regard to model building, and thus gave us a good range for
validation. The main focus of the study was the most complex problem: paired
domain-DNA binding. For this problem, we also found sequence/binding strength
correlations using measures from information theory. Prediction results were
uniformly good: the rule induction approach was able to correctly order all of
nine unseen examples for one NF-kappaB protein, achieved a correlation
coefficient of 0.52 on unseen (and noisy) examples in the EGR case, and reached
a classification accuracy of 69.7% for the Paired domain as evaluated by
cross-validation.

bound can be improved for a specific choice of observables. In particular, if
spin observables corresponding to orthogonal directions are measured at the
qubits (e.g., X and Y spin coordinates) then the bound is the same as the bound
for states with a local hidden variable model. As a consequence, it can
straightforwardly be shown that in the experiment described by J.-W. Pan et al.
[Nature 403, 515 (2000)] genuine three-qubit entanglement was detected.

spectroscopy on a trapped pair of atoms. The method relies on the phenomena
that the energy levels of two atoms in a harmonic trap are shifted by their
collisional interaction. The amount of shift depends on the strength of the
interaction (i.e. scattering length). By combining the spectra of the trap
state energy levels and a suitable model for the effective scattering length,
an estimate for the latter may be inferred. Two practical methods for measuring
the trap spectra are proposed and illustrated in examples. The accuracy of the
scheme is analyzed and requirements on measurement precision are given.

with the atomic transition may be suppressed by the atomic motion through
averaging or filtering mechanisms. The optical analogs of these velocity
effects are described. The two atomic levels correspond in the optical analogy
to orthogonal polarizations of light and the Rabi oscillations to polarization
oscillations in a medium which is optically active, naturally or due to a
magnetic field. In the later case, the two orthogonal polarizations could be
selected by choosing the orientation of the magnetic field, and one of them be
filtered out. It is argued that the time-dependent optical polarization
oscillations or their suppression are observable with current technology.

to every case that has been treated via the argument by Shor and Preskill, and
relieve them from the constraints of finding quantum error correcting codes. It
can also treat the cases with uncharacterized apparatuses. We derive a secure
key rate for the Bennett-Brassard-1984 protocol with an arbitrary source
characterized only by a single parameter representing the basis dependence.
