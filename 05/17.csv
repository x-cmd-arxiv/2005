fast wind, is still not satisfactorily explained. This is mainly due to the
theoretical difficulty of treating weakly collisional plasmas. The fluid
approach implies that the medium is collision dominated and that the particle
velocity distributions are close to Maxwellians. However the electron velocity
distributions observed in the solar wind depart significantly from Maxwellians.
Recent kinetic collisionless models (called exospheric) using velocity
distributions with a suprathermal tail have been able to reproduce the high
speeds of the fast solar wind. In this letter we present new developments of
these models by generalizing them over a large range of corona conditions. We
also present new results obtained by numerical simulations that include
collisions. Both approaches calculate the heat flux self-consistently without
any assumption on the energy transport. We show that both approaches - the
exospheric and the collisional one - yield a similar variation of the wind
speed with the basic parameters of the problem; both produce a fast wind speed
if the coronal electron distribution has a suprathermal tail. This suggests
that exospheric models contain the necessary ingredients for the powering of a
transonic stellar wind, including the fast solar one.

X-ray energies, with supporting observations frequently carried out at optical
and radio wavelengths. The large amount of simultaneous data has allowed us to
examine the variability of Mrk 421 in detail. The variabilities are generally
correlated between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, although the correlation
appears to be fairly loose. The light curves show the presence of flares with
varying amplitudes on a wide range of timescales both at X-ray and TeV
energies. Of particular interest is the presence of TeV flares that have no
coincident counterparts at longer wavelengths, because the phenomenon seems
difficult to understand in the context of the proposed emission models for TeV
blazars. We have also found that the TeV flux reached its peak days before the
X-ray flux during a giant flare in 2004. Such a difference in the development
of the flare presents a further challenge to the emission models. Mrk 421
varied much less at optical and radio wavelengths. Surprisingly, the normalized
variability amplitude in optical seems to be comparable to that in radio,
perhaps suggesting the presence of different populations of emitting electrons
in the jet. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of Mrk 421 is seen to vary
with flux, with the two characteristic peaks moving toward higher energies at
higher fluxes. We have failed to fit the measured SEDs with a one-zone SSC
model; introducing additional zones greatly improves the fits. We have derived
constraints on the physical properties of the X-ray/gamma-ray flaring regions
from the observed variability (and SED) of the source. The implications of the

literature, focusing primarily on spectral, angular and polarization
dependence. Astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of
information on the electron spin state, and these are normally averaged in
obtaining the requisite rates. In magnetic fields, higher order quantum
processes such as Compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency
and its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent. Such
divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of
excited Landau states. This practice requires the use of spin-dependent
cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process rates
very near cyclotronic resonances, the phase space domain most relevant for
certain applications to pulsar models. This paper develops previous results in
the literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decay
rates/widths in terms of a series of Legendre functions of the second kind;
these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models. The rates
are derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms, namely that due to Sokolov
and Ternov, and that due to Johnson and Lippmann. These constitute two sets of
eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation that diagonalize different operators, and
accordingly yield different spin-dependent cyclotron rates. This paper
illustrates the attractive Lorentz transformation characteristics of the
Sokolov and Ternov formulation, which is another reason why it is preferable
when electron spin information must be explicitly retained.

extremely accurately for different reconstruction methods even if \Omega_m is

GALEX as part of its All-sky Imaging Survey Early Release Observations.
Virtually all of the GALEX sources in the overlap region are detected by SDSS.
GALEX sources represent ~2.5% of all SDSS sources within these fields and about
half are optically unresolved. Most unresolved GALEX/SDSS sources are bright
blue turn-off thick disk stars and are typically detected only in the GALEX
near-UV band. The remaining unresolved sources include low-redshift quasars,
white dwarfs, and white dwarf/M dwarf pairs, and these dominate the optically
unresolved sources detected in both GALEX bands.
  Almost all the resolved SDSS sources detected by GALEX are fainter than the
SDSS 'main' spectroscopic limit. These sources have colors consistent with
those of blue (spiral) galaxies (u-r<2.2), and most are detected in both GALEX
bands. Measurements of their UV colors allow much more accurate and robust
estimates of star-formation history than are possible using only SDSS data.
Indeed, galaxies with the most recent (<20 Myr) star formation can be robustly
selected from the GALEX data by requiring that they be brighter in the far-UV
than in the near-UV band. However, older starburst galaxies have UV colors
similar to AGN, and thus cannot be selected unambiguously on the basis of GALEX
fluxes alone.
  With the aid of 2MASS data, we construct and discuss median 10 band
UV-optical-IR spectral energy distributions for turn-off stars, hot white
dwarfs, low-redshift quasars, and spiral and elliptical galaxies. We point out
the high degree of correlation between the UV color and the contribution of the
UV flux to the UV-optical-IR flux of galaxies detected by GALEX.

alpha absorber (sub-DLA) at z=2.187 towards the quasar HE0001-2340 (z_em=2.28)
using VLT/UVES data. This sub-DLA system consists of at least 25 individual
subcomponents spanning a restframe velocity range of ~400 km/s. Detected
species include CII, CIV, NI, NII, OI, MgII, AlII, AlIII, SiII, SiIV, PII,
FeII, and possibly DI. For the dominating neutral gas component at v=+13 km/s
we derive an oxygen abundance of [O/H]=-1.81. With its extremely low nitrogen
content ([N/H]<-3.3 and [N/O]<-1.5) the absorber exhibits a classic massive
star abundance pattern. The low [N/O] value is consistent with the idea that
primary nitrogen production by the very first stars have enriched the
intergalactic gas to a level of [N/O] ~ -1.5. Peculiar abundances are found in
the outermost blue components, where we observe significant overabundances of
phosphorus ([P/C] ~ +1.5), silicon ([Si/C] ~ +0.6), and aluminum ([Al/C] ~
+0.5). Our study suggests that the sight line passes through the gaseous
environment of one or more stellar clusters that locally enriched their
interstellar neighbourhood by supernova ejecta generating the observed
abundance anomalies. The large velocity spread of the entire absorption system
points to a merger that triggers the formation of these clusters. We thus may
be observing a young galaxy at z ~ 2 that currently forms out of a merger event
(abstract truncated).

Variables (LBVs) in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, in order to
investigate the geometries of their winds. We find that at least half of our
sample show changes in polarization across the strong H$\alpha$ emission line,
indicating that the light from the stars is intrinsically polarized and
therefore that asphericity already exists at the base of the wind. Multi-epoch
spectropolarimetry on four targets reveals variability in their intrinsic
polarization. Three of these, AG Car, HR Car and P Cyg, show a position angle
(PA) of polarization which appears random with time. Such behaviour can be
explained by the presence of strong wind-inhomogeneities, or `clumps' within
the wind. Only one star, R 127, shows variability at a constant PA, and hence
evidence for axi-symmetry as well as clumpiness. However, if viewed at low
inclination, and at limited temporal sampling, such a wind would produce a
seemingly random polarization of the type observed in the other three stars.
Time-resolved spectropolarimetric monitoring of LBVs is therefore required to
determine if LBV winds are axi-symmetric in general.
  The high fraction of LBVs ($>$ 50%) showing intrinsic polarization is to be
compared with the lower $\sim$ 20-25 % for similar studies of their
evolutionary neighbours, O supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars. We anticipate that
this higher incidence is due to the lower effective gravities of the LBVs,
coupled with their variable temperatures within the bi-stability jump regime.
This is also consistent with the higher incidence of wind asphericity that we
find in LBVs with strong H$\alpha$ emission and recent (last $\sim$ 10 years)
strong variability.

CO2 ice is not detected towards the source with lowest extinction in our
sample, Tamura 17 (A_V = 3.9m). A comparison of the Elias 16 spectrum with
laboratory data demonstrates that the majority of CO2 ice is embedded in a
polar H2O-rich ice component, with ~15% of CO2 residing in an apolar H2O-poor
mantle. This is the first detection of apolar CO2 towards a field star. We find
that the CO2 extinction threshold is A_V = 4m +/- 1m, comparable to the
threshold for water ice, but significantly less than the threshold for CO ice,
the likely precursor of CO2. Our results confirm CO2 ice forms in tandem with
H2O ice along quiescent lines of sight. This argues for CO2 ice formation via a
mechanism similar to that responsible for H2O ice formation, viz. simple
catalytic reactions on grain surfaces.

(carefully determined) measurement errors. About 20% of the sample stars are
much bluer than expected and are most plausibly explained as a population
having a much larger helium abundance than the bulk of the main sequence. We
estimate that the helium mass fraction of these stars is Y ~ 0.4. NGC 2808 may
have suffered self-enrichment, with different stellar populations born from the
ejecta of the intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of the
first generation. In addition to the Y=0.40 stars, roughly 30% of the stars
should have Y distributed between 0.26-0.29 while 50% have primordial Y, to
explain also the peculiar horizontal branch morphology. Three main stages of
star formation are identified, the first with primordial helium content Y ~
0.24, the second one born from the winds of the most massive AGBs of the first
stellar generation (6-7msun), having Y ~ 0.4, and a third one born from the
matter ejected from less massive AGBs (~ 3.5-4.5msun) with Y ~ 0.26-0.29. For a

point sources and $K^{\prime} \sim 23.5$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs6 aperture) for

The average stellar FWHM of the co-added image is 0\farcs18. Based on the
photometric measurements of detected galaxies, we obtained the differential
galaxy number counts, for the first time, down to $K^{\prime} \sim 25$, which
is more than 0.5 mag deeper than the previous data. We found that the number
count slope $d\log N/dm$ is about 0.15 at $22 < K^{\prime} < 25$, which is
flatter than the previous data. Therefore, detected galaxies in the SSDF have
only negligible contribution to the near-infrared extragalactic background
light (EBL), and the discrepancy claimed so far between the diffuse EBL
measurements and the estimated EBL from galaxy count integration has become
more serious . The size distribution of detected galaxies was obtained down to
the area size of less than 0.1 arcsec$^2$, which is less than a half of the
previous data in the $K^{\prime}$ band. We compared the observed size-magnitude
relation with a simple pure luminosity evolution model allowing for intrinsic
size evolution, and found that a model with no size evolution gives the best
fit to the data. It implies that the surface brightness of galaxies at high

analytical eigenvalue equations are solved for a large (50 X 2) lattice. In

  Surveillance System","7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.MA cs.RO",,"  This paper presents a methodology for optimal target detection in a multi
sensor surveillance system. The system consists of mobile sensors that guard a
rectangular surveillance zone crisscrossed by moving targets. Targets percolate
the surveillance zone in a poisson fashion with uniform velocities. Under these
statistics this paper computes a motion strategy for a sensor that maximizes
target detections for the next T time steps. A coordination mechanism between
sensors ensures that overlapping areas between sensors is reduced. This
coordination mechanism is interleaved with the motion strategy computation to
reduce detections of the same target by more than one sensor. To avoid an
exhaustive search in the joint space of all sensors the coordination mechanism
constraints the search by assigning priorities to the sensors. A comparison of
this methodology with other multi target tracking schemes verifies its efficacy
in maximizing detections. A tabulation of these comparisons is reported in
results section of the paper

computationally efficient methods are called for. The first step in this
direction was taken by Brady & Creighton (2000), who proposed and optimized a
two-stage, stack-slide search algorithm. We generalize and otherwise improve
upon the Brady-Creighton scheme in several ways. Like Brady & Creighton, we
consider a stack-slide scheme, but here with an arbitrary number of
semi-coherent stages and with a coherent follow-up stage at the end. We find
that searches with three semi-coherent stages are significantly more efficient
than two-stage searches (requiring about 2-5 times less computational power for
the same sensitivity) and are only slightly less efficient than searches with
four or more stages. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio required for
detection, as a function of computing power and neutron star spin-down-age,
using our optimized searches.

moving radially according to the Lorentz-Dirac equation in the Coulomb field of
a proton will not be attracted to a collision with the proton as expected.
Instead, it is repelled from the proton with proper acceleration increasing
asymptotically with proper time. Proponents of the Lorentz-Dirac equation
sometimes try to explain this away by speculation that the electron must
approach so closely to the proton that the field strength would be beyond the
domain of validity of the classical Lorentz-Dirac equation and therefore
require a quantum-mechanical analysis.
  This note proves some variants of Eliezer's result which apply to *bounded*,
compactly supported, spherically symmetric fields, and thus call into question
such speculation. However, these variants do require the additional hypothesis
(not required by Eliezer) that the electron is unaccelerated before entering
the field--i.e., that ""preacceleration"" is impossible.
  Though these results may not appear in the literature, the methods of proof
are well known. The motivation for writing down careful proofs was continued

pioneered by Baouendi, Rothschild and Treves is given. The main contribution
consists in showing that if a submanifold of $\C^n$ with higher codimension is
locally presented in a weighted normal form, similar to that described by Bloom
and Graham, then a characterization is given as to when a vector in the tangent
space belongs to the analytic wave front set for the set of locally defined CR
functions on the submanifold. This characterization is described in terms of
the sign of the inner product of this vector with the local graphing functions
for the submanifold on sectors of suitable size along complex lines in its
tangent space. Examples are given to show that under certain circumstances, the
results are sharp. Previous results by Baouendi et. al. contained a
semi-rigidity assumption which is not assumed in the present paper. The
hypoanalytic wave front set determines the cone of directions in which CR
functions extend analytically to the ambient space and thus provides an
explicit description of the local hull of holomorphy of a submanifold of

in a zero-order term, which does not have the simple structure of the solution

expansion, we propose an algorithm that shifts the effect of the obstacles from
the Normal Form to the higher-order terms. The Normal Form then remains
integrable, and the zero-order approximation retains the multiple-soliton
structure of the unperturbed solution. The obstacles are expressed in terms of
symmetries of the unperturbed equation, and decay exponentially away from the
soliton-interaction region. As a result, they generate a bounded correction
term, which decays exponentially away from the origin in the x-t plane. The

behavior vs collision energy at SPS is associated, apparently, with the
deconfinement phase transition at low SPS energies; a saturation of this
quantity at the RHIC energies indicates the limiting Hagedorn temperature for
hadronic matter. It is shown that if the cubic power of effective temperature
of pion transverse spectra grows with energy similarly to the rapidity density
(that is roughly consistent with experimental data), then the interferometry
volume is inverse proportional to the pion APSD that is about a constant
because of limiting Hagedorn temperature. This sheds light on the HBT puzzle.

to different forms of the estimator (e.g., centroid virial). The merit of this
procedure is that it allows a finite difference evaluation of the virial
estimator with respect to temperature, which totally avoids the need of
higher-order potential derivatives. We apply this procedure to energy and heat
capacity calculation of the (H_2)_22 and Ne_13 clusters at low temperature
using the fourth-order Takahashi-Imada and Suzuki propagators. This type of
calculation requires up to third-order potential derivatives if analytical
virial estimators are used, but in practice only first-order derivatives
suffice by virtue of the finite difference scheme above. From the application
to quantum clusters, we find that the fourth-order propagators do improve upon
the primitive approximation, and that the choice of the reference point plays a
vital role in reducing the variance of the virial estimator.

so-called interpreted languages and computational environments such as Maple,
Mathematica, IDL, Matlab etc. Problems which until recently were typically
solved on mainframe machines and written in computing languages such as Fortran
or C/C++, can now easily be solved on standard PCs with the bonus of immediate
visualizations of the results.
  In our undergraduate programs an often posed question is how to incorporate
and exploit efficiently these advances in the standard physics and mathematics
curriculum, without detracting the attention from the classical and basic
theoretical and experimental topics to be covered. Furthermore, if students are
trained to use such tools at early stages in their education, do such tools
really enhance and improve the learning environment? And, perhaps even more
important, does it lead to a better physics understanding?
  Here we present one possible approach, where computational topics are
gradually baked into our undergraduate curriculum in Mathematics and Physics,
Astronomy and Meteorology. We focus on training our students to use general
programming tools in solving physics problems, in addition to the classical
analytic problems. By this approach, the students gain an expertise that they
can build upon in their future studies and careers. We use mainly Java, Matlab
and Maple as computational environments. Our students are now capable of
handling at an early stage in their education more realistic physics problems
than before. We believe firmly that, in addition to educating modern
scientists, this promotes a better physics understanding for a majority of the
students.

Hodgkin-Huxley equations of neuron firing to better understand the essential
dynamics of the interaction of the membrane potential and the restoring force
and to capture, qualitatively, the general properties of an excitable membrane.
Even though its simplicity allows very valuable insight to be gained, the
accuracy of reproducing real experimental results is limited. In this paper, we
utilize a modified version of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations to model the
spatial propagation of neuron firing; we assume that this propagation is (at
least, partially) caused by the cross-diffusion connection between the
potential and recovery variables. We show that the cross-diffusion version of
the model, besides giving rise to the typical fast traveling wave solution
exhibited in the original diffusion Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations, also gives rise
to a slow traveling wave solution. We analyze all possible traveling wave
solutions of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations with this cross-diffusion term and
show that there exists a threshold of the cross-diffusion coefficient (the
maximum value for a given speed of propagation), which bounds the area where
normal impulse propagation is possible.

introduction of sequence heterogeneity using a simple scheme of just two types

continuous variables framework (CVPQC) and investigate its properties. In terms
of CVPQC we naturally define a ""maximally"" mixed state in phase space together
with its explicit construction and show that for increasing number of
encryption operations (which sets the length of a shared key between Alice and
Bob) the encrypted state is arbitrarily close to the maximally mixed state in
the sense of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance. We bring the exact solution for the
distance dependence and give also a rough estimate of the necessary number of
bits of the shared secret key (i.e. how much classical resources are needed for
an approximate encryption of a generally unknown continuous-variable state).
The definition of the CVPQC is analyzed from the Holevo bound point of view
which determines an upper bound of information about an incoming state an
eavesdropper is able to get from his optimal measurement.
