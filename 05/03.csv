parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the
N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in
regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing
lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole
expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm,
where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while
long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is
based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can
be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range
timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the
parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are
cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required
communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological
N-body simulation with more than 10^10 dark matter particles, reaching a
homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10^5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has
also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that
account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle
numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code
and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems.
GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.

afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the late GRB emission, thus indicating
that both are consistent with being produced by the same phenomenon. For the

the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index Gamma about 2. An

  Southern Open Clusters","44 pages, accepted by ApJS (minor changes to introduction, expanded
  conclusions per referee comments)",,"10.1086/432757",,"astro-ph",,"  Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B stars with circumstellar disks
that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possible reasons for
the rapid rotation of Be stars: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun
up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main-sequence (MS) evolution
of B stars. To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a
photometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky. Of these, five
clusters are probably not physically associated groups and our results for two
other clusters are not reliable, but we identify 52 definite Be stars and an
additional 129 Be candidates in the remaining clusters. We use our results to
examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the Be phenomenon. We find an
overall increase in the fraction of Be stars with age until 100 Myr, and Be
stars are most common among the brightest, most massive B-type stars above the
zero-age MS (ZAMS). We show that a spin-up phase at the terminal-age MS (TAMS)
cannot produce the observed distribution of Be stars, but up to 73% of the Be
stars detected may have been spun-up by binary mass transfer. Most of the
remaining Be stars were likely rapid rotators at birth.
  Previous studies have suggested that low metallicity and high cluster density
may also favor Be star formation. Our results indicate a possible increase in
the fraction of Be stars with increasing cluster distance from the Galactic
center (in environments of decreasing metallicity). However, the trend is not
significant and could be ruled out due to the intrinsic scatter in our data. We
also find no relationship between the fraction of Be stars and cluster density.

infrared counterpart of the brightest region of the radio jet. The jet has a
complex radio structure and brightens where bending occurs, most likely as a
result of relativistic beaming. We analyze archival data in the radio, optical
and X-ray bands and we derive its spectral energy distribution. Differently
from all of the previously known optical extragalactic jets, the jet in 3C401
is not detected in the X-rays even in a long 48ksec X-ray Chandra exposure and
the infrared emission dominates the overall SED. We propose that the dominant
radiation mechanism of this jet is synchrotron. The low X-ray emission is then
caused by two different effects: i) the lack of any strong external photon
field and ii) the shape of the electron distribution. This affects the location
of the synchrotron peak in the SED, resulting in a sharp cut-off at energies
lower than the X-rays. Thus 3C401 shows a new type of jet which has
intermediate spectral properties between those of FRI, which are dominated by
synchrotron emission up to X-ray energies, and FRII/QSO, which show a strong
high-energy emission due to inverse-Compton scattering of external photons.
This might be a clue for the presence of a continuous ``sequence'' in the
properties of large scale jets, in analogy with the ``blazar sequence'' already
proposed for sub-pc scale jets.

high recovery rate among this sample has been used to argue that the fraction
of truly dark bursts is ~10%. While a large fraction of earlier dark bursts can
be explained by the failure of ground-based searches to reach appropriate
limiting magnitudes, suppression of the optical light of these SXC dark bursts
seems likely. Here we report the discovery and observation of the radio
afterglow of GRB 020819, an SXC dark burst, which enables us to identify the
likely host galaxy (probability of 99.2%) and hence the redshift (z=0.41) of
the GRB. The radio light curve is qualitatively similar to that of several
other radio afterglows, and may include an early-time contribution from the
emission of the reverse shock. The proposed host is a bright R = 19.5 mag
barred spiral galaxy, with a faint R ~ 24.0 mag ""blob'' of emission, 3"" from
the galaxy core (16 kpc in projection), that is coincident with the radio
afterglow. Optical photometry of the galaxy and blob, beginning 3 hours after
the burst and extending over more than 100 days, establishes strong upper
limits to the optical brightness of any afterglow or associated supernova.
Combining the afterglow radio fluxes and our earliest R-band limit, we find
that the most likely afterglow model invokes a spherical expansion into a
constant-density (rather than stellar wind-like) external environment; within
the context of this model, a modest local extinction of A_V ~ 1 mag is
sufficient to suppress the optical flux below our limits.

50 kpc. A high quality entropy map reveals the presence of an extended region
of low entropy gas, running from the primary cluster core toward the northeast
along the nominal merger axis. The mass of the low entropy gas amounts to
approximately 2e13 solar masses, which is comparable to the baryonic mass of
the core of a rich cluster. We test the possibility that the origin of the
observed low entropy gas is either related to the disruption a preexisting
cooling core in Abell 3266 or to the stripping of gas from an infalling
subcluster companion. We find that both the radial pressure and entropy
profiles as well as the iron abundance of Abell 3266 do not resemble those in
other known cooling core clusters (Abell 478). Thus we conclude that the low
entropy region is subcluster gas in the process of being stripped off from its
dark matter halo. In this scenario the subcluster would be falling onto the
core of A3266 from the foreground. This would also help interpret the observed
high velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the cluster center, provided that
the mass of the subcluster is at most a tenth of the mass of the main cluster.

analytical expression for the manner in which coronagraphic suppression of an

in a spatially periodic array over the telescope aperture, regardless of the
details of the arrangement. A simple Lyot stop masking out pupil edges produces
good extinction of the central peak in the point-spread function (PSF), but
leaves satellite images caused by inter-segment gaps essentially unaffected.
Masking out the bright segment gaps in the Lyot plane with a reticulated mask
reduces the satellite images'intensity to a contrast of 5x10^{-9} on a 30 m

galaxies observed with the ROSAT/PSPC. We only select clusters with low
galactic nH in order to trace the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM) out
to large radii. We convert the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the
clusters into emission measure profiles scaled to the classical scaling
relations based on the spherical collapse model. We sort the clusters into
different temperature bins and stack the scaled emission measure (ScEM)
profiles of clusters together. The stacked profiles allow us to observe out to
radii r>r_200. In the center we find that the ScEM profiles deviate from
predicted scaling laws. This result is in very good agreement with current
studies on the L_X-T relation and the entropy - temperature relation (S \propto
T^0.65) found recently. At radii r>0.4r_200 we find that the ScEM profiles
agree well within the error bars, suggesting self-similarity. Fitting
beta-models to the overall ScEM profiles we find for the different sub samples
r_c=0.15-0.18 r_200 and beta=0.8, which is higher than beta=2/3 often found.
The beta-model is generally a better representation for hotter than for cooler
clusters. We see indications for continuous steepening of the profiles with
increasing radius: at radii r>0.8r_200 the profiles are systematically below
the beta-model curve with beta=0.8. We discuss our results with respect to the
observed X-ray luminosity L_X-T relation, the gas mass M_gas-T relation and the
total mass M-T relation. We also address implications on the origin of the
observed S-T relation. Furthermore we discuss the observed steepness of the
X-ray profiles, which falls off more rapidly than predicted from the

non-linear behavior of the X-ray light curve. However, with the higher spatial
resolution and sensitivity of Chandra, we separate out many nearby sources in

uncertainties on the tangential velocity components. The algorithm is applied
to tangential velocities measured in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865
stars taken from the Hipparcos catalog. The local stellar velocity distribution
function of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as a
mixture of two three-dimensional Gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary relative
responsibility. In the fitting, one Gaussian (the ""halo"") is fixed at the known
mean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the Galaxy halo, and the other
(the ""disk"") is allowed to take arbitrary mean and arbitrary variance tensor.
The mean and variance tensor (commonly the ""velocity ellipsoid"") of the disk
velocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar color,
with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion, slower mean
rotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than short-lived populations.
The local standard of rest (LSR) is inferred in the usual way and the Sun's
motion relative to the LSR is found to be
(U,V,W)_{\odot}=(10.1,4.0,6.7)+/-(0.5,0.8,0.2) km/s. Artificial data sets are

prominent than that expected if annihilation only occurs in the smoothed

stars formed together at an early epoch in the Universe, yet recent analyses of
galaxy spectra seem to indicate the presence of significant younger populations
of stars in them. The detailed physical modelling of such populations is
computationally expensive, inhibiting the detailed analysis of the several
million galaxy spectra becoming available over the next few years. Here we
present a data mining application aimed at decomposing the spectra of
elliptical galaxies into several coeval stellar populations, without the use of
detailed physical models. This is achieved by performing a linear independent
basis transformation that essentially decouples the initial problem of joint
processing of a set of correlated spectral measurements into that of the
independent processing of a small set of prototypical spectra. Two methods are
investigated: (1) A fast projection approach is derived by exploiting the
correlation structure of neighboring wavelength bins within the spectral data.
(2) A factorisation method that takes advantage of the positivity of the
spectra is also investigated. The preliminary results show that typical
features observed in stellar population spectra of different evolutionary
histories can be convincingly disentangled by these methods, despite the
absence of input physics. The success of this basis transformation analysis in
recovering physically interpretable representations indicates that this
technique is a potentially powerful tool for astronomical data mining.

the stabilising influence of a transverse magnetic field by introducing the

stability criteria for both molecular and atomic shocks under a wide range of

cooling increases with the temperature ($\alpha > 0$) are stabilised to the
first four modes if $M_a < 20$ ($\beta = 2$). For $\alpha = -0.5$, the first
overtone remains stable only for $M_a < 8$. We conclude that molecular shocks

attention recently both because of the novel physical concepts involved and

In the present work we discuss our experiments and interpretation for two

coated with Au. While the latter system exibits behavior typical of
superparamagnetic particle systems the former shows several puzzling results
such as extremely high blocking temperature ($T_{B}$), very fast relaxation
time well below $T_{B}$, temperature independent field-cooled magnetization and
very small coercivity and remanent magnetization. We interpret these findings
as being a result of weak ferromagnetism, characteristic of the graphitic
carbon. This induces strong magnetic interactions between the Ni particles in
the presence of small magnetic fields. Such systems give rise to a dramatic
difference in blocking temperature between measurements performed at zero field
and those performed at very small magnetic fields.

is difficult or even impossible due to surface nonuniformity and allows one to

behavior of organic monolayers down to 3 carbon atoms. The J-V characteristics
of MPTMS SAMs on Si are found to be asymmetric, and the direction of
rectification has been found to depend upon the applied voltage range. At
voltages < 2.45V, the reverse bias current was found to be higher than forward
bias current; while at higher voltages this trend was reversed. This result is
in agreement with Simmons theory. The tunnel barrier heights for this short
chain (2.56 and 2.14 eV respectively at Au and Si interfaces) are in good
agreement with the ones for longer chains (>10 carbon atoms) if the chain is
chemisorbed at the electrodes. These results extend all previous experiments on

these molecular monolayers, having good tunnel behavior (up to 2.5 eV) over a

Stokes parameters, of the photon distribution function and of the total
polarization degree can be formulated as a system of coupled first order
partial differential equations. As an application of our results we consider
the propagation of the cosmological gamma ray bursts in spatially homogeneous
and isotropic spaces with torsion and non-metricity. For this case the exact
general solution of the equation for the polarization degree is obtained, with
the effects of the torsion and non-metricity included. The presence of a
non-Riemannian geometrical background in which the electromagnetic fields
couple to torsion and/or non-metricity affect the polarization of photon beams.
Consequently, we suggest that the observed polarization of prompt cosmological
gamma ray bursts and of their optical afterglows may have a propagation effect
component, due to a torsion/non-metricity induced birefringence of the vacuum.
A cosmological redshift and frequency dependence of the polarization degree of
gamma ray bursts also follows from the model, thus providing a clear
observational signature of the torsional/non-metric effects. On the other hand,
observations of the polarization of the gamma ray bursts can impose strong
constraints on the torsion and non-metricity and discriminate between different
theoretical models.

of terms needed in the Taylor expansion approach depends on the strength of the
sign problem. Together this emphasizes the physical importance of the sign
problem and helps to clarify the range over which the Taylor expansion approach
is practically applicable. Finally, we observe that the positions of the
endpoint of the first order chiral phase transition in the QCD phase diagram
found in two successive computations by Fodor and Katz are both close to the
position of the phase transition line for pion condensation in phase quenched
QCD.

dynamical systems generated by piecewise affine contracting mappings whose

identified as quantifying interaction delays. In spite of their simplicity,
their dynamics presents a rich variety of behaviours. This phenomenology is not

models of regulatory networks. In a first step, our analysis concerns general
properties of networks on arbitrary graphs (characterisation of the attractor,
symbolic dynamics, Lyapunov stability, structural stability, symmetries, etc).
In a second step, focus is made on simple circuits for which the attractor and
its changes with parameters are described. In the negative circuit of 2 genes,
a thorough study is presented which concern stable (quasi-)periodic
oscillations governed by rotations on the unit circle -- with a rotation number
depending continuously and monotonically on threshold parameters. These regular
oscillations exist in negative circuits with arbitrary number of genes where

that ample line bundles on X satisfy many beautiful geometric, cohomological,
and numerical properties that render their behavior particularly tractable. By
contrast, examples due to Cutkosky and others have led to the common impression
that the linear series associated to non-ample divisors are in general mired in
pathology.
  However starting with fundamental work of Fujita, Nakayama, and Tsuji, it has
recently become apparent that arbitrary effective (or ""big"") divisors in fact
display a surprising number of properties analogous to those of ample line
bundles. The key is to study the properties in question from an asymptotic
perspective. At the same time, many interesting questions and open problems
remain.
  The purpose of the present expository note is to give an invitation to this
circle of ideas. In the hope that this informal overview might serve as a
jumping off point for the technical literature in the area, we sketch many
examples but provide no proofs. We focus on one particular invariant -- the
""volume"" of a line bundle -- that measures the rate of growth of the number of
sections of powers of the bundle in question.

In this paper we introduce the notion of energy complexity of an algorithm for

complexity in combination with computational complexity, provides an accurate

the error due to the ambiguity in the s-wave p-7Be scattering length. This

perturbation theory including Coulomb breakup by dipole transitions: 18.9 +/-
1.8 eV b. It turns out that the difference is due to the inclusion of the

common annotations; second, we analyze the expression profiles of the genes in
the set as measured by microarray experiments, searching for evidence of
coexpression. The sets which pass one or both filters are conjectured to
contain a significant fraction of coregulated genes, and the upstream motifs
characterizing the sets are thus good candidates to be the binding sites of the

between an infinite wall and a square barrier, with either a time-periodically
oscillating barrier (Model A) or bottom of the well (Model B). Based on the
Floquet theory, we derive in each case an equation which determines the
stability of the metastable system. We study the influence on the stability of
two Floquet states when their Floquet energies (real part) encounter a direct
or an avoided crossing at resonance. The effect of the amplitude of oscillation
on the nature of crossing of Floquet energies is also discussed. It is found
that by adiabatically changing the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation
field, one can manipulate the stability of states in the well. By means of a
discrete transform, the two models are shown to have exactly the same Floquet
energy spectrum at the same oscillating amplitude and frequency. The
equivalence of the models is also demonstrated by means of the principle of
gauge invariance.

in two-level bosonic atoms. The positive-P representation is shown to give a
full and complete description and can be further developed to give exact
treatments of the interaction of degenerate bosons with the electromagnetic
field in a given experimental situation. The Wigner representation, even when
truncated at second order, is shown to need a doubling of the phase-space to
allow for a positive-definite diffusion matrix in the appropriate Fokker-Planck
equation and still fails to agree with the full quantum results of the
positive-P representation. We show that quantum statistics and correlations
between the ground and excited states affect the dynamics of the emission
process, so that it is in general non-exponential.

group is set up as a multiplicity-free direct sum of all the unitary
irreducible representations of the group. This is abstracted from the
properties of the Schwinger oscillator construction for SU(2), and its
relevance in several quantum mechanical contexts is highlighted. The Schwinger
representations for $SU(2), SO(3)$ and SU(n) for all $n$ are constructed via
specific carrier spaces and group actions. In the SU(2) case connections to the
oscillator construction and to Majorana's theorem on pure states for any spin
are worked out. The role of the Schwinger Representation in setting up the
Wigner-Weyl isomorphism for quantum mechanics on a compact simple Lie group is
brought out.

show that the time-modulation of the pump field amplitude essentially improves
the degree of continuous-variable entanglement in NOPO. We develop
