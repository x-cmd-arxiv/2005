  Hale-Bopp","Accepted for publication in Icarus",,"10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.015",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of
comet Hale-Bopp. We do this by fitting simultaneously the infrared emission
spectrum measured by the infrared space observatory (ISO) and the measured
degree of linear polarization of scattered light at various phase angles and 12
different wavelengths. The effects of particle shape on the modeled optical
properties of the dust grains are taken into account. We constrain our fit by
forcing the abundances of the major rock forming chemical elements to be solar.
The infrared spectrum at long wavelengths reveals that large grains are needed
in order to fit the spectral slope. The size and shape distribution we employ
allows us to estimate the sizes of the crystalline silicates. The ratios of the
strength of various forsterite features show that the crystalline silicate
grains in Hale-Bopp must be submicron sized. We exclude the presence of large
crystalline silicate grains in the coma. Because of this lack of large
crystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphous
grains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need only
approximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. After correcting for
possible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, our
best estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material is
approximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies in
which the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%. The implications of this on
the possible origin and evolution of the comet are discussed. The crystallinity
we observe in Hale-Bopp is consistent with the production of crystalline
silicates in the inner solar system by thermal annealing and subsequent radial
mixing to the comet forming region.

to discover hundreds of SNe Ia in a systematic and automated fashion and study
them in detail.
  A prototype run of the SNfactory search pipeline conducted from 2002 to 2003
discovered 83 SNe at a final rate of 12 SNe/month. A large, homogeneous search
of this scale offers an excellent opportunity to measure the rate of SNe Ia.
This dissertation presents a new method for analyzing the true sensitivity of a

combined with knowledge of the host stars' metallicity to yield constraints on
the migration histories of gas giant planets. At any radius, planets that
barely manage to form around the lowest metallicity stars accrete their
envelopes just as the gas disk is being dissipated, so the lower envelope of
planets in a plot of metallicity vs semi-major axis defines a sample of
non-migratory planets that will have suffered less than average migration
subsequent to gap opening. Under the assumption that metallicity largely
controls the initial surface density of planetesimals, we use simplified core
accretion models to calculate how the minimum metallicity needed for planet
formation varies as a function of semi-major axis. Models that do not include
core migration prior to gap opening (Type I migration) predict that the
critical metallicity is largely flat between the snow line and a semimajor axis
of about 6 AU, with a weak dependence on the initial surface density profile of
planetesimals. When slow Type I migration is included, the critical metallicity
is found to increase steadily from 1-10 AU. Large planet samples, that include
planets at modestly greater orbital radii than present surveys, therefore have
the potential to quantify the extent of migration in both Type I and Type II
regimes.

a large galaxy overdensity (both in physical extent and density contrast).
There is good evidence that this `protocluster' region is the progenitor of a
present-day rich galaxy cluster. TN J1338 is the dominant galaxy in the
protocluster, in terms of size and luminosity and therefore seems destined to
evolve into the brightest cluster galaxy. The high spatial-resolution ACS
images reveal several kpc-scale features within and around the radio galaxy.
The continuum light is aligned with the radio axis and is resolved into two
clumps in the i-band and z-band bands. These components have luminosities ~10^9
L_sun and sizes of a few kpc. The estimated star-formation rate for the whole
radio galaxy is ~200 M_sun/yr. A simple model in which the jet has triggered
star-formation in these continuum knots is consistent with the available data.
An unusual feature is seen in Lyman-alpha emission. A wedge-shaped extension
emanates from the radio galaxy perpendicularly to the radio axis. This `wedge'
naturally connects to the surrounding, asymmetric, large-scale (~100 kpc)
Lyman-alpha halo. We posit that the wedge is a starburst-driven superwind,
associated with the first major epoch of formation of the brightest cluster
galaxy. The shock and wedge are examples of feedback processes due to both AGN
and star-formation in the earliest stages of massive galaxy formation.

a number of constraints on the properties of the variability as a function of
stellar and wind parameters. The results of our analysis show that all the
stars in the sample show evidence of significant lpv in H-alpha, mostly
dominated by processes in the wind. The variations occur between zero and 0.3
v_inf (i.e., below ~1.5 R_star), in good agreement with the results from
similar studies. A comparison between observations and line-profile simulations
indicates that for stars with intermediate wind densities the H-alpha
variability can be explained by simple models, consisting of coherent or broken
shells (blobs) uniformly distributed over the wind volume, with an intrinsic
scatter in the maximum density contrast of about a factor of two. For stars at
lower and higher wind densities, on the other hand, we found certain
inconsistencies between observations and our predictions, most importantly
concerning the mean amplitude and the symmetry properties of the TVS. This
disagreement might be explained with the presence of coherent large-scale
structures, partly confined in a volume close to the star. Interpreted in terms
of a variable mass-loss rate, the observed variations of H-alpha indicate
changes of 4% with respect to the mean value of M_dot for stars with stronger
winds and of 16% for stars with weaker winds. The effect of these variations on
the corresponding wind momenta is rather insignificant (<0.16 dex), increasing
the local scatter without affecting the Wind Momentum Luminosity Relationship.

chemistry in both atmospheric and astrophysical environments. In interstellar
space, photodissociation of H2O molecules can be a driving force behind the
chemistry on icy dust grains in dense, cold molecular clouds even though the
flux of UV photons is extremely low. The mechanisms of such photoinduced
processes are poorly understood, however. In this work the photodissociation
dynamics of a water molecule in crystalline ice at 10 K is studied
computationally using classical molecular dynamics. Photodissociation in the
first bilayer leads mainly to H atoms desorbing (65%), while in the third
bilayer trapping of H and OH dominates (51%). The kinetic energy distribution
of the desorbing H atoms is much broader than that for the corresponding
gas-phase photodissociation. The H atoms on average move 11 Angstroms before
becoming trapped, while OH radicals typically move 2 Angstroms. In accordance
with experiments a blueshift of the absorption spectrum is obtained relative to
gas-phase water.

have obtained deep (V,I) photometry of an outer-halo field in NGC 5128, to a
limiting magnitude of I~29. Our photometry directly reveals the core
helium-burning stellar population (the ``red clump'' or horizontal branch) in a
giant E/S0 galaxy for the first time.
  The color-magnitude diagram displays a very wide red giant branch (RGB), an
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) bump, and the red clump; no noticeable population
of blue HB stars is present, confirming previous suggestions that old, very
metal-poor population is not ubiquitous in the halo of this galaxy. From the
upper RGB we derive the metallicity distribution, which we find to be very
broad and moderately metal-rich, with average [M/H]=-0.64 and dispersion 0.49
dex. The MDF is virtually identical to that found in other halo fields observed
previously with the HST, but with an enhanced metal-rich population which was
partially missed in the previous surveys due to V-band incompleteness for these
very red stars. Combining the metallicity sensitive colors of the RGB stars
with the metallicity and age sensitive features of the AGB bump and the red

Submitted to ApJ","AIP Conf.Proc.836:117-120,2006","10.1063/1.2207869",,"astro-ph",,"  HETE-II and BeppoSAX have produced a sample of GRBs and XRFs with known

constraints on the nature of the source jets: Log $E_{iso}$ is approximately
uniformly distributed over several orders of magnitude; the inferred prompt
energy Log $E_{\gamma}$ is narrowly distributed; the Amati relation holds
between $E_{iso}$ and $E_{pk}$; and the Ghirlanda relation holds between
$E_{\gamma}$ and $E_{pk}$.
  We explore the implications of these constraints for GRB jet structure during
the prompt emission phase. We infer the underlying angular profiles from the
first two of the above constraints assuming all jets have the same profile and
total energy, and show that such ``universal jet'' models cannot satisfy both
constraints.
  We introduce a general and efficient method for calculating relativistic
emission distributions and $E_{pk}$ distributions from jets with arbitrary
(smooth) angular jet profiles. We also exhibit explicit analytical formulas for
emission from top-hat jets (which are not smooth). We use these methods to
exhibit $E_{pk}$ and $E_{iso}$ as a function of viewing angle, for several
interesting families of GRB jet profiles. We use the same methods to calculate
expected frequency distributions of $E_{iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$ for the same
families of models.
  We then proceed to explore the behavior of universal jet models under a range
of profile shapes and parameters, to map the extent to which these models can
conform to the above four empirical constraints.

of dSph, dIrr/dSph, and dIrr galaxies contain GCCs. The fraction of GCCs
located near the center of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is >2 times higher than
that for dIrrs. The mean integral color of GCCs in dSphs, V-I = 1.04+/-0.16
mag, coincides with the corresponding value for Galactic globular clusters and
is similar to the blue globular cluster sub-populations in massive early-type

t < 1 Gyr, while the red GCC population is likely to be older. The detected
GCCs have absolute visual magnitudes between M_V = -10 and -5 mag. We find
indications for an excess population of faint GCCs with M_V > -6.5 mag in both
dSph and dIrr galaxies, reminiscent of excess populations of faint globular
clusters in nearby Local Group spiral galaxies. The measurement of structural
parameters using King-profile fitting reveals that most GCCs have structural

Observations were made in nine nights during the first half of the year 2000;
seven RQQSOs: 0748+291, 0945+438, 1017+280, 1029+329, 1101+319, 1225+317,

existence of intra-night variability. RQQSOs 0945+438, 1029+329, 1101+319 and

variability data for radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs from the literature for
statistical analysis. It is found that a good fraction of radio-quiet AGNs show
intra-night variations with the maximum amplitude of variation being about 10%.
On the other hand blazars show at times intra-night flux variability up to
100%. In case of radio-loud AGNs (excluding blazars), maximum amplitude of
intra-night variation lies between the variability amplitude of radio-quiet
AGNs and blazars i.e. the flux variation is close to 50%. The results indicate
that the energy generation mechanism and the environment around the central
engine in different classes of AGNs may be similar, if not identical. The
standard model for radio-loud AGNs, where shocks are propagating down
relativistic jet or models based on disturbances in accretion disks can also
explain the micro-variability in RQQSOs.

critical nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion $V_c$ needed to obtain the

ordering is driven by the Coulomb repulsion and the electron-lattice

virtually no effect on $V_c$ or on the characteristics of the charge-ordered

breakdown of vortex loops is studied. We perform investigation on the base of
the ''rate equation'' for the distribution function $n(l)$ of number of loops
of length $l$ proposed by Copeland with coauthors. By using the special ansatz
in the ''collision'' integral we have found the exact power-like solution of
''kinetic equation'' in stationary case. That solution is the famous
equilibrium distribution $n(l)\varpropto l^{-5/2}$ obtained earlier in
numerical calculations. Our result, however, is not equilibrium, but on the
contrary, it describes the state with two mutual fluxes of the length (or
energy) in space of the vortex loop sizes. Analyzing this solution we drew
several results on the structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle in the
superfluid turbulent helium. In particular, we obtained that the mean radius of
the curvature is of order of interline space. We also obtain that the decay of
the vortex tangle obeys the Vinen equation, obtained earlier
phenomenologically. We evaluate also the full rate of reconnection events.

to high values such that the dynamical shaking temperature is strongly reduced,
we observe a logarithmic decay of the defect density into a grain boundary

systems containing no pinning. We specifically demonstrate these effects for
vortices in thin film superconductors, and discuss implications for dynamical
reordering transition studies in these systems.

insulators lead to a variety of intriguing non-equilibrium transport phenomena.
These include slow relaxation and a variety of memory effects characteristic of
glasses. Here we show that when such systems are driven with sufficiently high
current, and in liquid helium bath, a peculiar type of conductance noise can be
observed. This noise appears in the conductance versus time traces as
downward-going spikes. The characteristic features of the spikes (such as
typical width) and the threshold current at which they appear are controlled by
the sample parameters. We show that this phenomenon is peculiar to hopping
transport and does not exist in the diffusive regime. Observation of
conductance spikes hinges also on the sample being in direct contact with the
normal phase of liquid helium; when this is not the case, the noise exhibits
the usual 1/f characteristics independent of the current drive. A model based
on the percolative nature of hopping conductance explains why the onset of the
effect is controlled by current density. It also predicts the dependence on
disorder as confirmed by our experiments. To account for the role of the bath,
the hopping transport model is augmented by a heuristic assumption involving
nucleation of cavities in the liquid helium in which the sample is immersed.
The suggested scenario is analogous to the way high-energy particles are
detected in a Glaser's bubble chamber.

system, that uses cycles of bindings rather than the linear chains of bindings
used in the standard WAM representation. Both the HAL and dProlog languages
make use of the PARMA representation in their Herbrand constraint solvers.
Unfortunately, PARMA's trailing scheme is considerably more expensive in both
time and space consumption. The aim of this paper is to present several
techniques that lower the cost.
  First, we introduce a trailing analysis for HAL using the classic PARMA
trailing scheme that detects and eliminates unnecessary trailings. The
analysis, whose accuracy comes from HAL's determinism and mode declarations,
has been integrated in the HAL compiler and is shown to produce space
improvements as well as speed improvements. Second, we explain how to modify
the classic PARMA trailing scheme to halve its trailing cost. This technique is
illustrated and evaluated both in the context of dProlog and HAL. Finally, we
explain the modifications needed by the trailing analysis in order to be
combined with our modified PARMA trailing scheme. Empirical evidence shows that
the combination is more effective than any of the techniques when used in
isolation.

of dynamics, trajectories in the configuration space are represented by

set $\partial\mathcal{D}$ of the domain of admissible motion, the geodesics
change the cone sectors several times (or an infinite number of times) in the
neighborhood of the singular set $\partial\mathcal{D}$. We show that this
singular set contains interesting information about the dynamical complexity of
the model. Firstly, this set can be used as a Poincar{\'e} surface for
construction of Poincar{\'e} sections, and the trajectories then have the
recurrence property. We also investigate the distribution of the intersection

Math","Experimental Math. 15 (2006), 129-159.",,,"math.GT hep-th math.QA",,"  We propose a framework for unifying the sl(N) Khovanov-Rozansky homology (for
all N) with the knot Floer homology. We argue that this unification should be
accomplished by a triply graded homology theory which categorifies the HOMFLY
polynomial. Moreover, this theory should have an additional formal structure of
a family of differentials. Roughly speaking, the triply graded theory by itself
captures the large N behavior of the sl(N) homology, and differentials capture
non-stable behavior for small N, including knot Floer homology. The
differentials themselves should come from another variant of sl(N) homology,
namely the deformations of it studied by Gornik, building on work of Lee.
  While we do not give a mathematical definition of the triply graded theory,
the rich formal structure we propose is powerful enough to make many
non-trivial predictions about the existing knot homologies that can then be
checked directly. We include many examples where we can exhibit a likely
candidate for the triply graded theory, and these demonstrate the internal
consistency of our axioms. We conclude with a detailed study of torus knots,
developing a picture which gives new predictions even for the original sl(2)
Khovanov homology.

pairs $(X,f)$, where $X$ is a stable spherical variety and $f : X \to \bP$ is a
finite equivariant morphism. This space is projective, and its irreducible
components are rational. It generalizes the moduli space of pairs $(X,D)$,
where $X$ is a stable toric variety and $D$ is an effective ample Cartier
divisor on $X$ which contains no orbit. The equivariant automorphism group of
$\bP$ acts on our moduli space; the spherical varieties over $\bP$ and their
stable limits form only finitely many orbits. A variant of this moduli space
gives another view to the compactifications of quotients of thin Schubert cells
