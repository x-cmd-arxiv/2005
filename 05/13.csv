X-ray sources within a radius of 10 arcmin from the centre. Approximately half
of these are CXB sources, with the remaining half being LMXBs. The spatial

with the distribution of the K-band light observed in the 2MASS survey. After
correction for the incompleteness effect we constrain the LMXB luminosity
function down to 2 times 10^{36} erg/s, much lower than previous studies of
LMXBs in elliptical galaxies. The obtained XLF flattens significantly below L_X
= 5 times 10^{37} erg/s and follows the dN/dL proportional to 1/L law in
agreement with the behaviour found earlier for LMXBs in the Milky Way and in
the bulge of M31.

spectra of subgiants and stars at the base of the RGB in M15, most within the
range 16.5 < V < 19.5 (1.2 < M_V < 4.2), with the goal of deriving C abundances
(from the G band of CH) and N abundances (from the NH band at 3360 A).
Star-to-star stochastic variations with significant range in both [C/Fe] and
[N/Fe] are found at all luminosities extending to the subgiants at M_V ~ +3.
The C and N abundances appear anti-correlated, as would be expected from the
CN-cycle processing of stellar material. Yet these M15 stars are considerably
fainter than the RGB bump, the point at which deep mixing is believed to set
in. On this basis, while the observed abundance pattern is consistent with
proton capture nucleosynthesis, we infer that the site of the reactions is
likely not within the present sample. The range of variation of the N
abundances is very large and the sum of C+N increases as C decreases. To
reproduce this requires the incorporation not only of CN but also of
ON-processed material. Combining our work with that of Trefzger et al (1983)
for the brighter giants in M15, we find strong evidence for additional
depletion of C among the most luminous giants. This presumably represents the
first dredge up (with enhanced deep mixing) expected for such luminous cluster
RGB stars in the course of normal stellar evolution as they cross the RGB bump.
We compare the behavior of these patterns for C and N in globular clusters
covering a wide range of metallicity and of current mass and discuss possible
scenarios to reproduce the observed behavior of these key elements. (abridged)

galaxies follow the same Fundamental Plane tilt and scatter for galaxies in
high density environments. However, a few galaxies notably deviate from the

terms of their younger stellar populations, which are presumably induced by a
gaseous merger. Overall, isolated galaxies have similar properties to those in
roups and clusters with a slight enhancement in the frequency of recent

evolution of the largest association identified by Drummond (2000), and the
decoherence of synthetic NEO families intended to reproduce the observed

hard 10-100 s flares at the highest disk luminosities in a regime where the

degree of anisotropy in the satellite locations is a good tracer of the
flattening of the hosts' halos. If all hosts have luminous circular disks, the
symmetry axes of the projected mass and light are not perfectly aligned, and
the locations of the satellites depend upon how the hosts' disks are placed
within their halos. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the
major axes of the halos, the satellites show a pronounced ""Holmberg effect"". If
the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the intermediate axes of the

essentially isotropic. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with

the satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts, with a
preference for being found nearby the hosts' major axes. This agrees well with
the observation that satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to
be found nearby the major axes of their hosts, and suggests that the mass and

expanding fireball being explicitly investigated. Assuming an intrinsic 'Band'
shape spectrum and an intrinsic energy-independent emission profile, we show
that merely the curvature effect can produce detectable spectral lags if the
intrinsic pulse profile has a gradually decaying phase. We examine the spectral
lag's dependences on some physical parameters, such as the Lorentz factor
\Gamma, the low-energy spectral index, \alpha, of the intrinsic spectrum, the
duration of the intrinsic radiation t_d' and the fireball radius R. It is shown
that approximately the lag \propto \Gamma ^{-1} and \propto t_d', and a
spectrum with a more extruded shape (a larger \alpha) causes a larger lag. We
find no dependence of the lag on R. Quantitatively, the lags produced from the
curvature effect are marginally close to the observed ones, while larger lags
require extreme physical parameter values, e.g., \Gamma < 50, or \alpha > -0.5.
The curvature effect causes an energy-dependent pulse width distribution but
the energy dependence of the pulse width we obtained is much weaker than the
observed W \propto E^{-0.4} one. This indicates that some intrinsic
mechanism(s), other than the curvature effect, dominates the pulse narrowing of
GRBs.

the red, is larger in the diffusive models. The differences described in points
ii) and iii) tend to vanish for M > Msun. In terms of the theoretical

the `coupled' mode in which the X-ray and radio luminosities are closely
coupled and vary only weakly, and (ii) the `flaring' mode, which dramatically
boosts the radio luminosity but makes no impact on the X-ray luminosity. The
systems are in the flaring mode only a few percent of the time. However, flares
completely dominate the power spectrum of radio emission, with the consequence
that sources in which the flaring mode occurs, such as GRS 1915+105 and Cyg
X-3, have radio power spectra that lie more than an order of magnitude above
the corresponding X-ray power spectra. Of the four microquasars for which we
have examined data, in only one, Cyg X-1, is the flaring mode seemingly
inactive. While Cyg X-1 is a black-hole candidate, one of the three flaring
sources, Sco X-1, is a neutron star. Consequently, it is likely that both modes
are driven by the accretion disk rather than black-hole spin. Radio imaging
strongly suggests that the flaring mode involves relativistic jets. A typical
microquasar is in the flaring mode a few percent of the time, which is similar
to the fraction of quasars that are radio loud. Thus there may be no essential
difference between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars; radio loudness may
simply be a function of the epoch at which the source is observed.

10^-3 to 10^-13 kg and covering a meteor velocity range from 11 to 71 km/s, we
numerically modeled both thermal ablation and sputtering ablation during
atmospheric flight. We considered three meteoroid models believed to be
representative of asteroidal (3300 kg m^-3 mass density), cometary (1000 kg
m^-3) and porous cometary (300 kg m^-3) meteoroid structures. Atmospheric
profiles which considered the molecular compositions at different heights were
used in the sputtering calculations. We find that while in many cases
(particularly at low velocities and for relatively large meteoroid masses)
sputtering contributes only a small amount of mass loss during atmospheric
flight, in some cases sputtering is very important. For example, a 10^-10 kg
porous meteoroid at 40 km/s will lose nearly 51% of its mass by sputtering,
while a 10^-13 kg asteroidal meteoroid at 60 km/s will lose nearly 83% of its
mass by sputtering. We argue that sputtering may explain the light production
observed at very great heights in some Leonid meteors. The impact of this work
will be most dramatic for very small meteoroids such as those observed with
large aperture radars.

peaks at ~190 micron. Once a protostar has formed, the luminosity rises (due to
a growing contribution from accretion onto the protostar) and the peak of the
SED shifts to shorter wavelengths (~80-100 micron). However, by the end of the
Class 0 phase, the accretion rate is falling, the luminosity has decreased, and
the peak of the SED shifts back towards longer wavelengths (90-150 micron). In
our simulations, the density of material around the protostar remains
sufficiently high well into the Class 0 phase that the protostar only becomes
visible in the NIR if it is displaced from the centre dynamically. Raw submm/mm
maps of Class 0 protostars tend to be much more centrally condensed than those
of prestellar cores. However, when convolved with a typical telescope beam, the
difference in central concentration is less marked, although the Class 0
protostars appear more circular. Our results suggest that, if a core is deemed
to be prestellar on the basis of having no associated IRAS source, no cm radio
emission, and no outflow, but it has a circular appearance and an SED which
peaks at wavelengths below ~170 micron, it may well contain a very young Class

increasing the packing density, changing the interactions between particles, or
otherwise restricting the local motion of the elements of the system. The onset
of collectivity occurs because, when one particle is blocked, it may lead to
the blocking of a neighbor. That particle may then block one of its neighbors,
these effects propagating across some typical domain of size named the
dynamical correlation length. When this length diverges, the system becomes
immobile. Even where it is finite but large the dynamics is dramatically
slowed. Such phenomena lead to glasses, gels, and other very long-lived
nonequilibrium solids. The bootstrap percolation models are the simplest
examples describing these spatio-temporal correlations. We have been able to
solve one such model in two dimensions exactly, exhibiting the precise
evolution of the jamming correlations on approach to arrest. We believe that

  We find explicit expressions for the memory friction kernel and hence, {\em
via} the Fluctuation-Dissipation
  Theorem, for the spectral density of the magnetization thermal fluctuations.
  For magnetic samples in which the single domain approximation is valid, we
derive an equation for the dynamics of the uniform mode.
  Finally we apply this equation to study the dynamics of the uniform
magnetization mode in insulating ferromagnetic thin films.
  As experimental consequences we find that the fluctuation correlation time is
of the order of the ratio between the film thickness, $h$, and the speed of
sound in the magnet and that the line-width of the ferromagnetic resonance peak
should scale as $B_1^2h$ where $B_1$ is the magnetoelastic coupling constant.

inductive definition of domain predicates. Here, a different solution is
proposed: exploiting coinductive types to model infinite computations. To every
type A we associate a type of partial elements Partial(A), coinductively
generated by two constructors: the first, return(a) just returns an element

the discussion by presenting a particularly simple example of an analogue

discussed in the literature. The last decade in particular has seen a
remarkable and sustained development of analogue gravity ideas, leading to some
hundreds of published articles, a workshop, two books, and this review article.
Future prospects for the analogue gravity programme also look promising, both
on the experimental front (where technology is rapidly advancing) and on the
theoretical front (where variants of analogue models can be used as a
springboard for radical attacks on the problem of quantum gravity).

new parameters. The Higgs sector in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the
SM (MSSM) is a 2HDM itself. The neutral Higgs searches performed at LEP are

interpreted in the context of 2HDMs. Depending on the model considered
exclusion of large regions of the parameter space can be obtained, but the
existence of the lightest Higgs boson with masses lower than 90 GeV is not
ruled out in all models by LEP. In the MSSM at least one of the neutral Higgs

when radiative corrections are included, this mass should be less than about
140 GeV. This prediction provides a strong motivation for searches at present

appropriate for students in both experimental and theoretical particle
physics.The purpose is to present an elementary and self-contained introduction
to SUSY that follows on, relatively straightforwardly, from graduate-level
courses in relativistic quantum mechanics and introductory quantum field
theory. The notation adopted, at least initially, is one widely used in RQM
courses, rather than the `spinor calculus' (dotted and undotted indices)
notation found in most SUSY sources, though the latter is introduced in
optional Asides. There is also a strong preference for a `do-it-yourself'
constructive approach, rather than for a top-down formal deductive treatment.
The main goal is to provide a practical understanding of how the softly broken
MSSM is constructed. Relatively less space is devoted to phenomenology, though
simple `classic' results are covered, including gauge unification, the bound on
the mass of the lightest Higgs boson, and sparticle mixing. By the end of the
course students (readers) should be provided with access to the contemporary

method for the subtraction of infrared singular configurations arising from

for NNLO perturbative calculations in $e^+e^- \to $ jets. The building blocks
of the scheme are antenna functions derived from the matrix elements for
tree-level $1\to 3$ and $1 \to 4$ and one-loop $1 \to 3$ processes. By
construction, these building blocks have the correct infrared behaviour when
one or two particles are unresolved. At the same time, their integral over the
antenna phase space is straightforward. As an example of how to use the scheme
we compute the NNLO contributions to the subleading colour QED-like
contribution to $e^+e^- \to 3$ jets.
  To illustrate the application of NNLO antenna subtraction for different
colour structures, we construct the integrated forms of the subtraction terms
needed for the five-parton and four-parton contributions to $e^+e^- \to 3$ jets
at NNLO in all colour factors, and show that their infrared poles cancel
analytically with the infrared poles of the two-loop virtual correction to this

explain how to preserve protons from rapid decay mediated by virtual black

visitation peaking after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a
news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential
prediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the
inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users:
the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site
follows a power law distribution, in contrast with the exponential expected for
Poisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual
user's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's
visitation. Finally, our results document the fleeting quality of news and
events: while fifteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online
media, we find that access to most news items significantly decays after 36
hours of posting.

harmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general
finite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of
nonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the
Klein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be
stated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 060503 (2005)]. These higher dimensional analogues of the
analysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general
conditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical
harmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement
theory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.
Disordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of
examples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area
law can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical
correlations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice
system with a modified interaction. We briefly comment on a general
relationship between criticality and area laws for the entropy of entanglement.

transforms POVM's into POVM's, generally irreversibly, thus loosing some of the

unexpectedly, it turns out that such cleanness property is largely unrelated to
the convex structure of POVM's, and there are clean POVM's that are not
extremal and vice-versa. In this paper we solve the cleannes classification
problem for number n of outcomes n<=d (d dimension of the Hilbert space), and

In fact, all known solutions are coupled to specific properties of the
Hamiltonian and may be divided into two categories: One class consists of
time-dependent Hamiltonians which are not higher than quadratic in the position
operator, like i.e the driven harmonic oscillator with time-dependent
frequency. The second class is related to the existence of additional
invariants in the Hamiltonian, which can be used to map the solution of the
time-dependent problem to that of a related time-independent one.
  In this article we discuss and develop analytic methods for solving
time-dependent tunneling problems, which cannot be addressed by using quadratic
Hamiltonians. Specifically, we give an analytic solution to the problem of
tunneling from an attractive time-dependent potential which is embedded in a
long-range repulsive potential.
  Recent progress in atomic physics makes it possible to observe experimentally
time-dependent phenomena and record the probability distribution over a long
range of time. Of special interest is the observation of macroscopical
quantum-tunneling phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensates with time-dependent
trapping potentials. We apply our model to such a case in the last section.
