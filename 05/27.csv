the magnitude gap between the first and second brightest galaxy and the

minor merging only, wheras non-FGs on average form later. The early assembly of
FGs leaves sufficient time for galaxies of $L \sim L_*$ to merge into the
central one by dynamical friction, resulting in the large magnitude gap at
$z=0$. A fraction of 33$\pm$16% of the groups simulated are found to be fossil,
whereas the observational estimate is $\sim$10-20%. The FGs are found to be
X-ray over-luminous relative to non-FGs of the same optical luminosity, in
qualitative agreement with observations. Finally, from a dynamical friction

along filaments with small impact parameters do FGs exist at all.

in a tidal field, which agrees excellently with detailed N-body simulations.
The analytic expression can be used to predict the mass and age histograms of
surviving clusters for any cluster initial mass function and any cluster
formation history. The method is applied to open clusters in the solar
neighbourhood, based on the new cluster sample of Kharchenko et al. From a
comparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the age
range between 10 Myr to 3 Gyr we find the following results: (1) The disruption
time of a 10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3+/-0.5 Gyr.
This is a factor 5 shorter than derived from N-body simulations of clusters in
the tidal field of the galaxy. (2) The present starformation rate in bound
clusters within 600 pc from the Sun is 5.9+/-0.8 * 10^2 M_sun / Myr, which
corresponds to a surface star formation rate in bound clusters of 5.2+/-0.7
10^(-10) M_sun/yr/pc^2. (3) The age distribution of open clusters shows a bump
between 0.26 and 0.6 Gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higher
than before and after. (4) The present star formation rate in bound clusters is
half as small as that derived from the study of embedded clusters. The
difference suggests that half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood become
unbound within 10 Myr. (5) The most massive clusters within 600 pc had an
initial mass of 3*10^4 M_sun. This is in agreement with the statistically
expected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2,
even if the physical upper mass limit is as high as 10^6 M_sun.

it, causes the sample to cool. This has been known to occur in some
intermetallic compounds, for which a moderate entropy increase can be induced
when a field is applied, thus giving rise to an inverse magnetocaloric effect.
However, the entropy change found for some ferromagnetic Ni-Mn-Sn alloys is
just as large as that reported for giant MCE materials, but with opposite sign.
The giant inverse MCE has its origin in a martensitic phase transformation that
modifies the magnetic exchange interactions due to the change in the lattice
parameters.

response at low magnetic fields, where nonlinear processes arising from motion
of Abrikosov fluxons are ineffective. The results show that different

involving weak links. At temperatures close to Tc, a further contribution to
the harmonic emission is present; it can be ascribed to modulation of the order

form a uniaxially incommensurate herringbone (UI-HB) solid. At high coverages
the solid consists of adsorbate molecules that are primarily rolled on their
side perpen-dicular to the surface of the substrate. As the coverage is
decreased, the amount of molecular rolling diminishes until $\rho$ = 0.933
where it disappears (molecules become primarily parallel to the surface). If
the density is decreased enough, vacancies appear. As the temperature is
increased we observe a three-phase regime for $\rho > 0.933$ (with an
orientationally ordered nematic mesophase), for lower coverages the system
melts directly to the disordered (and isotropic) liquid phase. The
solid-nematic transition temperature is very sensitive to coverage whereas the
melting temperature is quite insensitive to it, except for at low coverages
where increased in-plane space and ultimately vacancies soften the solid phase
and lower the melting temperature. Our results signal the importance of
molecular rolling and tilting (which result from an the competition between
molecule-molecule and molecule-substrate interactions) for the formation of the
intermediate phase, while the insensitivity of the system's melting temperature
to changing density is understood in terms of in-plane space occupation through
rolling. Comparisons and contrasts with experimental results are discussed.

control, applying a uniaxial force couple at the top and bottom rows of the
lattice in mode-I type loading. The approach lends itself naturally to the
inclusion of disorder and enables a wide variety of fracture behaviours to be
studied, ranging from systems with a simple geometrical discontinuity to more
complex crack geometries and random cracking. Breakdown can be initiated from a
pre-cracked sheet or from an intact sheet where the first damage appears at
random, and buckling sets in when a displacement vector containing out-of-place
components becomes energetically favourable over one which does not. In this
paper we only consider center-cracked sheets with no disorder and include some
results relevant to the force- and displacement-fields, and the buckling
response ratio. Rather than carry out a comprehensive study of such systems,

arbitrarily between zero and infinity. Applying a uniaxial force couple along
the top and bottom rows of the lattice, fracture proceeds according to where
the ratio of the stress field to the local strength is most intense. Since
breakdown is initiated from an intact sheet where the first crack appears at
random, the onset and mode of buckling varies according to where and how the
cracks grow. For a wide range of disorders the stress-strain relationships for
buckling sheets are compared with those for non-buckling sheets. The ratio of

effect (CE) of assembling the active nano-elements into functional quasi two
dimensional patterns over finite surfaces within a number, M of subsystems,
being of the same type but different in details, may be regulated by changing
the ambient conditions. This regulation of the CE requires that the immobile
nano-elements, arranged into regular array over the surface, are to be
activated due to local information transfer realized by hopping nano-sized
elements, each represented by a pair of its ends only: sending end and the
receiving one; two neighbor sites of the array identify position of that pair.
Then, the CE may be regulated by varying the number M, a common forcing factor
and efficiency of projecting the regularity of the array onto the CE.

solutions of massless gravity as being due to the effect of the exchange of

Inside this region, we can trust the two-field Lagrangian perturbatively, while
at larger distances one can use the higher derivative formulation. We also
compare massive gravity with other models, namely deconstructed theories of

a factor of T) the surface tensions of the domain walls between the
corresponding (Euclidean) deconfined phases. For T much larger than Tc our
results match on to the known perturbative result, which exhibits Casimir
Scaling, being proportional to k(N-k). At lower T the coupling becomes stronger
and, not surprisingly, our calculations show large deviations from the
perturbative T-dependence. Despite this we find that the behaviour proportional
to k(N-k) persists very accurately down to temperatures very close to Tc. Thus
the Casimir Scaling of the 't Hooft tension appears to be a `universal' feature
that is more general than its appearance in the low order high-T perturbative
calculation. We observe the `wetting' of these k-walls at T around Tc and the
(almost inevitable) `perfect wetting' of the k=N/2 domain wall. Our
calculations show that as T tends to Tc the magnitude of the spatial `t Hooft
string tension decreases rapidly. This suggests the existence of a (would-be)
't Hooft string condensation transition at some temperature which is close to
but below Tc. We speculate on the `dual' relationship between this and the

unification, the predicted relic abundance of neutralinos usually exceeds the
strict limits imposed by the WMAP collaboration. One way to obtain the correct
relic abundance is to abandon gaugino mass universality and allow a mixed
wino-bino lightest SUSY particle (LSP). The enhanced annihilation and
scattering cross sections of mixed wino dark matter (MWDM) compared to bino
dark matter lead to enhanced rates for direct dark matter detection, as well as
for indirect detection at neutrino telescopes and for detection of dark matter
annihilation products in the galactic halo. For collider experiments, MWDM
leads to a reduced but significant mass gap between the lightest neutralinos so
that chi_2^0 two-body decay modes are usually closed. This means that dilepton
mass edges-- the starting point for cascade decay reconstruction at the CERN
LHC-- should be accessible over almost all of parameter space. Measurement of
the m_{\tz_2}-m_{\tz_1} mass gap at LHC plus various sparticle masses and cross

to study QCD predictions for three sum rules of deep-inelastic scattering,

$G$. Then we proved that the map from $V$ to $D_1$ induced by the period map is
a pluriharmonic map. We also give a Kahler metric on $V$, which is called the
Hodge metric. We proved that the Ricci curvature of the Hodge metric is
negative away from zero. We also proved the non-existence of the K\""ahler
metric on the classifying space of a Calabi-Yau threefold which is invariant
under a cocompact lattice of $G$.

posterior analysis of the Dirichlet process, and a posterior calculus for Gamma
processes to ascertain properties of linear functionals of Dirichlet processes.
In particular, in conjunction with a Gamma identity, we show easily that a
generalized Cauchy-Stieltjes transform of a linear functional of a Dirichlet
process is equivalent to the Laplace functional of a class of, what we define
as, Beta-Gamma processes. This represents a generalization of an identity due
to Cifarelli and Regazzini, which is also known as the Markov-Krein identity
for mean functionals of Dirichlet processes. These results also provide new
explanations and interpretations of results in the literature. The identities
are analogues to quite useful identities for Beta and Gamma random variables.
We give a result which can be used to ascertain specifications on H such that
the Dirichlet functional is Beta distributed. This avoids the need for an
inversion formula for these cases and points to the special nature of the
Dirichlet process, and indeed the functional Beta-Gamma calculus developed in
this paper.

ideas of statistical mechanics. First we show, in the general case of
asymmetric interactions, the existence of a strategy that allows any player to
eliminate losses after a finite random time. In the special case of symmetric
interactions, we also prove that, as time goes to infinity, the game converges
to a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, assuming that all agents adopt the same
strategy, using arguments related to those leading to perfect simulation
algorithms, spatial mixing and ergodicity are proved. In turn, ergodicity
allows us to prove ``fixation'', i.e. that players will adopt a constant

the turbulent velocity fluctuations are responsible for the magnetic field

  intervals information","25 pages, to be published in Journal of Neurocience Methods",,,,"q-bio.QM math.ST physics.bio-ph physics.data-an stat.TH",,"  We demonstrate the efficacy of a new spike-sorting method based on a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm by applying it to real data recorded from
Purkinje cells (PCs) in young rat cerebellar slices. This algorithm is unique
in its capability to estimate and make use of the firing statistics as well as
the spike amplitude dynamics of the recorded neurons. PCs exhibit multiple
discharge states, giving rise to multimodal interspike interval (ISI)
histograms and to correlations between successive ISIs. The amplitude of the
spikes generated by a PC in an ""active"" state decreases, a feature typical of
many neurons from both vertebrates and invertebrates. These two features
constitute a major and recurrent problem for all the presently available
spike-sorting methods. We first show that a Hidden Markov Model with 3
log-Normal states provides a flexible and satisfying description of the complex
firing of single PCs. We then incorporate this model into our previous MCMC
based spike-sorting algorithm (Pouzat et al, 2004, J. Neurophys. 91, 2910-2928)
and test this new algorithm on multi-unit recordings of bursting PCs. We show
that our method successfully classifies the bursty spike trains fired by PCs by
using an independent single unit recording from a patch-clamp pipette.

give examples in which the best efficiency is not achieved even if we allow any

variable entanglement in a noisy environment. In particular, we focus our
attention on the multimode entangled states achievable by second order
nonlinear crystals, {\em i.e.} coherent states of ${\rm SU}(m,1)$ group. The
full inseparability in the ideal case is shown, whereas thresholds for
separability are given for the tripartite case in the presence of noise. We
then consider coherent states of ${\rm SU}(m,1)$ as support for a telecloning
protocol, providing the first example of a completely asymmetric $1 \to m$
telecloning. We derive explicitly the optimal relation among the different
fidelities of the clones. The effect of noise in the various stages of the
protocol is taken into account, thus permitting its adaptive modifications to
the noisy environment. In the optimized scheme the clones' fidelity remains
maximal even in the presence of losses (in the absence of thermal noise), for
propagation times that diverge as the number of modes increases, indicating
that telecloning is a more effective way to distribute quantum information then
direct transmission followed by local cloning.

desired for tunneling and interference experiments with the advantage of
tunneling distances being in the nanometer regime.
