watershed event. Thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the GRB position by
Swift, we began imaging the GRB field 8 minutes after the burst and continued
for the following 8 days. No convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow or
supernova was found for the object. We present a re-analysis of the XRT
afterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4"" to the west of the XRT
position reported previously. Close to this position is a bright elliptical
galaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster of
galaxies. Based on positional coincidences, the GRB and the bright elliptical
are likely to be physically related. We thus have discovered evidence that at
least some short-duration, hard-spectra GRBs arise at cosmological distances.
However, while GRB 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration GRBs, we
demonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy is
consistent with that of long-duration GRBs. Based on this analysis, on the
location of the GRB (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type
(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there is
now observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts arise
during the merger of a compact binary. We limit the properties of a
Li-Paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' Other progenitor models are still viable, and
additional rapidly localized bursts from the Swift mission will undoubtedly
help to further clarify the progenitor picture. (abridged)

when a current-aligned magnetic field (the so-called ""guide field"") is

separates into two obliquely-propagating modes, which we call the relativistic
drift-kink-tearing instability (RDKTI). These two waves deform the current
sheet so that they trigger relativistic magnetic reconnection at a crossover
thinning point. Since relativistic reconnection produces a lot of non-thermal

waves (tensor perturbations) taking into account their coupling to relic

For the tensor modes that reenter the horizon in the radiation era after
neutrino decoupling we calculate the neutrino suppression factor as
1-5rho_nu/9rho+O[(rho_nu/rho)^2]. This result is consistent with the value
obtained for three neutrino flavors by Weinberg and is in agreement with
numerical Boltzmann evolution. A minimal formula with the correct asymptotic
form on small and large scales reproduces to about ten percent the evolution on
all scales probed by the CMB. A more accurate solution (in terms of elementary
functions) shows that the modes reentering the horizon in the radiation era are
slightly enhanced and the phase of their temporal oscillations is shifted by
subdominant nonrelativistic matter. The phase shift grows logarithmically on
subhorizon scales until radiation-matter equality; the accumulated shift scales
for k>>k_eq as (ln k)/k. The modes reentering the horizon after equality are,
in turn, affected by the residual radiation density. These modes follow the
naive matter-era evolution which is advanced by a redshift and scale
independent increment of conformal time. In an appendix, we introduce a general
relativistic measure of radiation intensity that in any gauge obeys a simple
transport equation and for decoupled particles is conserved on superhorizon

the photometric zero point (ZP) and the saturation magnitude (m_inf), and
derive tight constraints for both parameters [sigma(ZP) = 0.01 mag and

necessary for the UVOT B and V filters,but is necessary for the U filter for

the spatial variation in the pixel sensitivity of the UVOT detector.

introducing any acceleronlike scalar fields. Although a formal similarity of
the FNW scenario with the variable CC one can be easily established, one
nevertheless finds different laws for neutrino mass variation in each scenario.
We show that as long as the neutrino number density dilutes canonically, only a
very slow variation of the neutrino mass is possible. For neutrino masses to
vary significantly (as in the FNW scenario), a considerable deviation from the
canonical dilution of the neutrino number density is also needed. We note that

five years with FEROS at the 1.52-m ESO and later at the 2.2-m MPG/ESO
telescope in La Silla, Chile. Based on the collected data we calculated an
orbital solution with a period of P=711 days, a semi-amplitude of K1=105 m/s,
and an eccentricity of e=0.4. The period of the radial-velocity variation is
longer than that of the estimated stellar rotation, rendering it unlikely that
rotational modulation is the source of the variation in the radial velocity.
This hypothesis is supported by the absence of a correlation between stellar
activity indicators and radial-velocity variation. By determining a primary
stellar mass of Mstar=1.91 Msun, the best-fit minimum mass of the companion and
semi-major axis of the orbit are m2sini=6.54 Mjup and a2=1.93 AU, respectively.
An upper limit for the mass of the companion of m2 < 65.5 Mjup has been
calculated from Hipparcos astrometric measurements. Although the possibility of
a brown-dwarf companion cannot be excluded, HD 11977 B is one of the few planet
candidates detected around an intermediate-mass star. The progenitor
main-sequence star of HD 11977 is probably an A-type star. This discovery gives
an indirect evidence for planetary companions around early type main-sequence

taking into account the emission from the stars as well as from the cluster
wind. It is shown that the level and character of the soft (0.2-10 keV) X-ray
emission change drastically with cluster age and are tightly linked with
stellar evolution. Using the modern X-ray observations of massive stars we show
that the correlation between bolometric and X-ray luminosity known for single O
stars also holds for O+O and O+Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries. The diffuse emission
originates from the cluster wind heated by the kinetic energy of stellar winds
and supernova explosions. To model the evolution of the cluster wind, the mass
and energy yields from a population synthesis are used as input to a
hydrodynamic model. It is shown that in a very young clusters the emission from
the cluster wind is low. When the cluster evolves, WR stars are formed. Their
strong stellar winds power an increasing X-ray emission of the cluster wind.
Subsequent supernova explosions pump the level of diffuse emission even higher.
Clusters at this evolutionary stage may have no X-ray bright stellar point
sources, but a relatively high level of diffuse emission. A supernova remnant
may become a dominant X-ray source, but only for a short time interval of a few
thousand years. We retrieve and analyse Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of

reproduces the observed diffuse and point-source emission from these LMC

takes place at low density and high temperature where usually the ideal gas

exploiting the exact $\bar{C}_{4}$ symmetry of the 8-band $k\cdot p$
Hamiltonian with the strain taken into account via the continuum mechanical
model. The operators representing symmetry group elements were represented in
the plane wave basis and the group projectors were used to find the symmetry
adapted basis in which the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix is block diagonal
with four blocks of approximately equal size. The quantum number of total
quasi-angular momentum is introduced and the states are classified according to
its value. Selection rules for interaction with electromagnetic field in the
dipole approximation are derived. The method was applied to calculate electron
and hole quasibound states in a periodic array of vertically stacked pyramidal
self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots for different values of the distance
between the dots and external axial magnetic field. As the distance between the
dots in an array is varied, an interesting effect of simultaneous change of
ground hole state symmetry, type and the sign of miniband effective mass is
predicted. This effect is explained in terms of the change of biaxial strain.
It is also found that the magnetic field splitting of Kramer's double
degenerate states is most prominent for the first and second excited state in
the conduction band and that the magnetic field can both separate otherwise
overlapping minibands and concatenate otherwise nonoverlapping minibands.

cuprates correspond to the formation of spin singlet pairing under the bosonic
resonating-valence-bond (RVB) description. We present a series of evidence in
support of such a scenario based on the calculated magnetic properties
including uniform spin susceptibility, spin-lattice and spin-echo relaxation
rates, which consistently show that strong spin correlations start to develop
upon entering the UPP, being enhanced around the momentum (\pi, \pi) while
suppressed around (0, 0). The phase diagram in the parameter space of doping
concentration, temperature, and external magnetic field, is obtained based on
the the bosonic RVB theory. In particular, the competition between the Zeeman
splitting and singlet pairing determines a simple relation between the
""critical"" magnetic field, H_{PG}, and characteristic temperature scale, T0, of
the UPP. We also discuss the magnetic behavior in the lower pseudogap phase at
a temperature Tv lower than T0, which is characterized by the formation of
Cooper pair amplitude where the low-lying spin fluctuations get suppressed at
both (0, 0) and (\pi, \pi). Properties of the UPP involving charge channels
will be also briefly discussed.

theoretical interest in exotic baryons. The Theta^+ is a baryon that has
strangeness S=+1, meaning that it contains an anti-strange quark. Thus it
cannot be constructed from three quarks, unlike all other known baryons; it
needs at least an extra quark-antiquark pair. It is usually modeled as a
pentaquark state in the 10 bar representation of flavor SU(3), with flavor
content \bar{s}uudd.
  This thesis considers possible heavy pentaquarks, in which the antiquark is
charmed or bottom rather than strange. In the context of the diquark model of
Jaffe and Wilczek, it is argued that negative-parity pentaquarks of this type
may be lighter than their positive-parity counterparts, and hence are likely to
be stable against strong decay. Estimates are made for their masses, and their
weak decays are discussed. Isospin relations are found between the decay rates
for different possible decay channels.
  Negative-parity heavy pentaquarks are also considered in a less
model-dependent way, in the context of a 1/N_c expansion, where N_c is the
number of colors. Heavy quark effective theory is also employed. Mass relations
are found between the mass splittings of heavy pentaquarks and those of
nonexotic baryons, and SU(3)-breaking corrections to these relations are
computed. The results could be helpful in interpreting experimental data if
heavy pentaquarks are observed.

appearance based on neutrino decay. We introduce a heavy neutrino, which is
produced in pion and muon decays because of a small mixing with muon neutrinos,
and then decays into a scalar particle and a light neutrino, predominantly of
the electron type. We require values of $g m_4\sim$ few eV, $g$ being the
neutrino--scalar coupling and $m_4$ the heavy neutrino mass, e.g. $m_4$ in the
range from 1 keV to 1 MeV and $g \sim 10^{-6} - 10^{-3}$. Performing a fit to
the LSND data as well as all relevant null-result experiments, we show that all
data can be explained within this decay scenario. In the minimal version of the
decay model, we predict a signal in the upcoming MiniBooNE experiment
corresponding to a transition probability of the same order as seen in LSND. In
addition, we show that extending our model to two nearly degenerate heavy
neutrinos it is possible to introduce CP violation in the decay, which can lead
to a suppression of the signal in MiniBooNE running in the neutrino mode. We
briefly discuss signals in future neutrino oscillation experiments, we show
that our scenario is compatible with bounds from laboratory experiments, and we

the Casimir force, which appears to be dependent on film material and can be

classical electrodynamics the model predicts appearance of anomalous electric

application. The existence and number of solutions for various cases has been
studied from a theoretical standpoint. These results generally rely upon growth
conditions of the nonlinearity. However, in general, one cannot forecast how
many solutions a boundary value problem may possess or even determine the
existence of a solution. In recent years numerical continuation methods have
been developed which permit the numerical approximation of all complex
solutions of systems of polynomial equations. In this paper, numerical
continuation methods are adapted to numerically calculate the solutions of
finite difference discretizations of nonlinear two-point boundary value
problems. The approach taken here is to perform a homotopy deformation to
successively refine discretizations. In this way additional new solutions on
finer meshes are obtained from solutions on coarser meshes. The complicating
issue which the complex polynomial system setting introduces is that the number
of solutions grows with the number of mesh points of the discretization. To

mass M is much more than another masses mj, i=1..N, which revolve around M. The

  This is a collection of five papers on the foundation of triangulated
categories in the context of groupoid-enriched categories, termed track
categories, and characteristic cohomology classes. As a main result it is shown
that given an additive category A with a translation functor t: A --> A and a
class V in translation cohomology H^3(A,t) then two simple properties of V
imply that (A,t) is a triangulated category. The cohomology class V yields an
equivalence class (B,[s]) where B is a track category with homotopy category A
and [s] is the homotopy class of a pseudofunctor s: B --> B inducing t. The two
properties of V correspond to natural axioms on B and s which again imply that
(A,t) is a triangulated category.

interest to the historian of physics since it represents a turning inward to
examine the very nature of reasoning and the relationship between thought and
reality. In the West, Aristotle (384-322 BCE) is generally credited with the
formalization of the tradition of logic and also with the development of early
physics. In India, the Rigveda itself in the hymn 10.129 suggests the
beginnings of the representation of reality in terms of various logical
divisions that were later represented formally as the four circles of: ""A"",
""not A"", "":A and not A"", and ""not A and not not A''. According to Puranic
accounts, Medhatithi Gautama and Aksapada Gautama (or Gotama), which are
perhaps two variant names for the author of the early formal text on Indian
logic, belonged to about 550 BCE. The Greek and the Indian traditions seem to
provide the earliest formal representations of logic, and in this article we
ask if they influenced each other. We are also interested in the scope of early
logic, since this gives an idea to us of the way early thinkers thought about
nature and change. We will show that Greek and Indian logical traditions have
much that is distinctive and unique and that they must have emerged
independently.

both the individual and population level. The rules for this random walk are
based on complex biological processes and it may be difficult to develop a
tractable, quantitatively-accurate, individual-level model. However, important
problems in areas ranging from ecology to medicine involve large collections of
individuals, and a further intellectual challenge is to model population-level
behavior based on a detailed individual-level model. Because of the large
number of interacting individuals and because the individual-level model is
complex, classical direct Monte Carlo simulations can be very slow, and often
of little practical use. In this case, an equation-free approach may provide
effective methods for the analysis and simulation of individual-based models.
In this paper we analyze equation-free coarse projective integration. For
analytical purposes, we start with known partial differential equations
describing biological random walks and we study the projective integration of
these equations. In particular, we illustrate how to accelerate explicit
numerical methods for solving these equations. Then we present illustrative
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of these random walks and show a decrease in
computational time by as much as a factor of a thousand can be obtained by
exploiting the ideas developed by analysis of the closed form PDEs. The
illustrative biological example here is chemotaxis, but it could be any random
walker which biases its movement in response to environmental cues.

acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure. Amino
acids from a group have similar physicochemical properties, and the same
structural characteristics. The results suggest that amino acid preference for

Polyphaga Mimivirus. Here we present a systematic analysis of gene and genome
duplication events in the Mimivirus genome. We find that one third of the

  2004","Int.J.Quant.Inf. 4 (2006) 429",,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th",,"  In these proceedings we give a pedagogical and non-technical introduction to
the Quantum Field Theory approach to entanglement entropy. Particular attention
is devoted to the one space dimensional case, with a linear dispersion
relation, that, at a quantum critical point, can be effectively described by a
two-dimensional Conformal Field Theory.

degrees of freedom for each atom and discuss its realization with cold rubidium
atoms on atom chips. We investigate the performance of this collisional phase
gate and show that gate operations with high fidelity can be realized in
magnetic traps that are currently available on atom chips.
