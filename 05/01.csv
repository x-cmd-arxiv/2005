leading to the formation of a cluster of protostellar cores. The purpose of
these simulations is to address a specific numerical problem called artificial
fragmentation, that plagues SPH simulations of cloud fragmentation. We argue
that this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and that the only
reasonable and practical way to address it is to use a relatively new technique
called particle splitting. Our largest simulation has an effective resolution
of 256^3 particles (much higher than most previous SPH simulations of cloud
fragmentation) and results in the formation of a dense cluster containing ~3000
protostellar cores. It is the first simulation of this kind to properly resolve
the Jeans mass throughout the entire system, at all times, thus preventing
artificial fragmentation.

electronic structure associated with typical defects which substitute for Cu in
the CuO2 planes of high-Tc superconducting materials. The focus is primarily on
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, the material on which most STM measurements of impurity
resonances in the superconducting state have been performed. The magnitudes of
the effective potentials found for Zn, Ni and vacancies on the in-plane Cu
sites in this host material are remarkably consistent with phenomenological
fits of potential scattering models to STM resonance energies. The effective
potential ranges are quite short, of order 1 A with weak long range tails, in
contrast to some current models of extended potentials which attempt to fit STM
data. For the case of Zn and Cu vacancies, the effective potentials are
strongly repulsive, and states on the impurity site near the Fermi level are
simply removed. The local density of states (LDOS) just above the impurity is
nevertheless found to be a maximum in the case of Zn and a local minimum in
case of the vacancy, in agreement with experiment. The Zn and Cu vacancy
patterns are explained as due to the long-range tails of the effective impurity
potential at the sample surface. The case of Ni is richer due to the Ni atom's
strong hybridization with states near the Fermi level; in particular, the short
range part of the potential is attractive, and the LDOS is found to vary
rapidly with distance from the surface and from the impurity site. We propose
that the current controversy surrounding the observed STM patterns can be
resolved by properly accounting for the effective impurity potentials and
wave-functions near the cuprate surface. Other aspects of the impurity states
for all three species are discussed.

sum-over-states (SOS) expression for nonlinear susceptibilities. This new
dipole-free expression is more compact, converges to the same results as the
common SOS equation, and is more appropriate for analyzing certain systems such
as octupolar molecules. The dipole-free theory can be used as a tool for
analyzing the uncertainties in quantum calculations of susceptibilities, can be
applied to a broader set of quantum systems in the three-level model where the
standard SOS expression fails, and more naturally leads to fundamental limits
of the nonlinear susceptibilities.

  Proceedings of the Workshop on Kinetic Theory, The Fields Institute, Toronto,
  March 29 - April 2, 2004",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Traditional plasma physics has mainly focused on regimes characterized by
high temperatures and low densities, for which quantum-mechanical effects have
virtually no impact. However, recent technological advances (particularly on
miniaturized semiconductor devices and nanoscale objects) have made it possible
to envisage practical applications of plasma physics where the quantum nature
of the particles plays a crucial role. Here, I shall review different
approaches to the modeling of quantum effects in electrostatic collisionless
plasmas. The full kinetic model is provided by the Wigner equation, which is
the quantum analog of the Vlasov equation. The Wigner formalism is particularly
attractive, as it recasts quantum mechanics in the familiar classical phase
space, although this comes at the cost of dealing with negative distribution
functions. Equivalently, the Wigner model can be expressed in terms of $N$
one-particle Schr{\""o}dinger equations, coupled by Poisson's equation: this is
the Hartree formalism, which is related to the `multi-stream' approach of
classical plasma physics. In order to reduce the complexity of the above
approaches, it is possible to develop a quantum fluid model by taking
velocity-space moments of the Wigner equation. Finally, certain regimes at
large excitation energies can be described by semiclassical kinetic models
(Vlasov-Poisson), provided that the initial ground-state equilibrium is treated
quantum-mechanically. The above models are validated and compared both in the
linear and nonlinear regimes.
