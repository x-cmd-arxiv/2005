of a Faraday rotation measure gradient of ~ 500 rad/m^2/mas transverse to the

roughly six months apart. This stable transverse rotation measure gradient is
expected if a helical magnetic field wraps around the jet. The overall order to
the magnetic field in the inner projected 40 parsecs is consistent with a
helical field. However, we find an unexpected increase in fractional
polarization along the edges of the source, contrary to expectations. This high
fractional polarization rules out internal Faraday rotation, but is not readily
explained by a helical field. After correcting for the rotation measure, the
intrinsic magnetic field direction in the jet of 3C 273 changes from parallel
to nearly perpendicular to the projected jet motion at two locations. If a

is sourced by baryonic density fluctuations and the fluctuations in the
ionization fraction due to discrete \ion{H}{2} regions. Since Thomson
scattering produces only E-type polarization and is achromatic, its unique
fingerprint can in principle be separated from foregrounds associated with
polarized synchrotron emission which should not be correlated with the cosmic

  Precession","17 pages, 5 figures, accepted to ApJ","Astrophys.J. 632 (2005) 1048-1053","10.1086/432973",,"astro-ph",,"  There is some evidence, though yet unconfirmed, that Sagittarius A*--the
supermassive black hole at the Galactic center--emits its radio waves modulated
with a ~100-day period. What is intriguing about this apparent
quasi-periodicity is that, though the amplitude of the modulation increases
with decreasing wavelength (from 3.6 to 1.3 cm), the quasi-period itself does
not seem to depend on the frequency of the radiation. It is difficult to
imagine how a binary companion, were that the cause of this modulation, could
have escaped detection until now. Instead, it has been suggested that the
spin-induced precession of a disk surrounding a slowly rotating black hole
could have the right period to account for this behavior. In this paper, we
examine how Sagittarius A*'s light curve could be modulated by this mechanism.
We demonstrate that the partial occultation of a nonthermal halo by a compact,
radio-opaque disk does indeed produce the observed frequency-dependent
amplitude. This appears to be in line with other observational arguments
suggesting that Sagittarius A*'s mm/sub-mm spectrum is produced by a ~10
Schwarzschild-radius disk, whereas its cm-waves originate from a nonthermal
particle distribution in a halo extending out to over 20 Schwarzschild radii.
Interestingly, this model suggests that the observed period corresponds to half
the precession period and that a non-axisymmetric disk could produce a second
period roughly twice as long as the first.

First, the HRS spans at least the redshift range from 17,000 to 22,500 km s^-1.
Second, the overdensity of galaxies in the inter-cluster regions of the HRS in
this redshift range is estimated to be 2.4, or del rho/ rho ~ 1.4. Third, we
find a systematic trend of increasing redshift along a Southeast-Northwest
(SE-NW) spatial axis in the HRS, in that the mean redshift of HRS members
increases by more than 1500 km s^-1 from SE to NW over a 12 deg region. Fourth,
the HRS is bi-modal in redshift with a separation of ~ 2500 km s^-1 (35 Mpc)
between the higher and lower redshift peaks. This fact is particularly evident
if the above spatial-redshift trend is fitted and removed. In short, the HRS
appears to consist of two components in redshift space, each one exhibiting a
similar systematic spatial-redshift trend along a SE-NW axis. Lastly, we
compare these results from the HRS with the Shapley supercluster and find
similar properties and large-scale features.

chance of being perturbed by central caustics. In this paper, we investigate
the properties of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them. We
derive analytic expressions of the location, size, and shape of the central
caustic as a function of the star-planet separation, $s$, and the planet/star
mass ratio, $q$, under the planetary perturbative approximation and compare the
results with those based on numerical computations. While it has been known
that the size of the planetary caustic is \propto \sqrt{q}, we find from this
work that the dependence of the size of the central caustic on $q$ is linear,
i.e., \propto q, implying that the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly
with the decrease of $q$ compared to the planetary caustic. The central-caustic
size depends also on the star-planet separation. If the size of the caustic is
defined as the separation between the two cusps on the star-planet axis
(horizontal width), we find that the dependence of the central-caustic size on
the separation is \propto (s+1/s). While the size of the central caustic
depends both on $s$ and q, its shape defined as the vertical/horizontal width
ratio, R_c, is solely dependent on the planetary separation and we derive an
analytic relation between R_c and s. Due to the smaller size of the central
caustic combined with much more rapid decrease of its size with the decrease of
q, the effect of finite source size on the perturbation induced by the central
caustic is much more severe than the effect on the perturbation induced by the

broad HI absorption, earlier detected in low-resolution WSRT observations, is
occurring against the bright, eastern radio lobe, about 1.6 kpc from the
nucleus. We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed
comparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised
gas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas
phases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the
same outflow. Earlier studies of the ionised gas had already found evidence for
a strong interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar medium at the
location of the eastern radio lobe. Our results show that the fast outflow
produced by this interaction also contains a component of neutral atomic
hydrogen. The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM
and accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed. Our observations
demonstrate that, following this strong jet-cloud interaction, not all gas
clouds are destroyed and that part of the gas can cool and become neutral. The
mass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end
of the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies. This suggests
that AGN-driven outflows, and in particular jet-driven outflows, can have a
similar impact on the evolution of a galaxy as starburst-driven superwinds.

""Nuker-law"" profile, which were compared with those already known for the
optically selected objects. We find that radio active galaxies are always of
the ""core"" type (i.e. an inner Nuker law slope gamma < 0.3). However, there are
core-type galaxies which harbor no significant radio source and which are
indistinguishable from the radio active galaxies. We do not find any radio
detected galaxy with a power law profile (gamma > 0.5). This difference is not
due to any effect with absolute magnitude, since in a region of overlap in
magnitude the dichotomy between radio active and radio quiescent galaxies
remains. We speculate that core-type objects represent the galaxies that have
been, are, or may become, radio active at some stage in their lives; active and
non-active core-type galaxies are therefore identical in all respects except
their eventual radio-activity: on HST scales we do not find any relationship
between boxiness and radio-activity. There is a fundamental plane, defined by
the parameters of the core (break radius r_b and break brightness mu_b), which
is seen in the strong correlation between r_b and mu_b. The break radius is
also linearly proportional to the optical Luminosity in the $I$ band. Moreover,
for the few galaxies with an independently measured black hole mass, the break
radius turns out to be tightly correlated with M_{BH}. The black hole mass
correlates even better with the combination of fundamental plane parameters r_b
and mu_b, which represents the central velocity dispersion.

consistent with the extended core accretion formation models of Jupiter
described by Alibert et al. (2005b) and derived from Alibert et al.

subnebula, as well as the evolution of the surface density as given by an
$\alpha$-disk model and is used to calculate the thermodynamical conditions in
the subdisk, for different values of the viscosity parameter. We show that the
Jovian subnebula evolves in two different phases during its lifetime. In the
first phase, the subnebula is fed through its outer edge by the solar nebula as
long as it has not been dissipated. In the second phase, the solar nebula has
disappeared and the Jovian subdisk expands and gradually clears with time as
Jupiter accretes the remaining material. We also demonstrate that early
generations of satellites formed during the beginning of the first phase of the
subnebula cannot survive in this environment and fall onto the proto-Jupiter.
As a result, these bodies may contribute to the enrichment of Jupiter in heavy
elements. Moreover, migration calculations in the Jovian subnebula allow us to
follow the evolution of the ices/rocks ratios in the proto-satellites as a
function of their migration pathways. By a tempting to reproduce the distance
distribution of the Galilean satellites, as well as their ices/rocks ratios, we
obtain some constraints on the viscosity parameter of the Jovian subnebula.

proper account of the radiative feedback of the progenitor stars on the
surroundings. We carry out a series of one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
with radiative cooling, starting from initial configurations that are drawn
from the results of our earlier radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the first
HII regions. In low-mass (< 10^6 M_sun) halos, the stellar radiation
significantly reduces the ambient gas density prior to the SN explosion. The
blastwave quickly propagates over the halo's virial radius, leading to complete
evacuation of the gas even with the input energy of 10^50 erg. We find that a
large fraction of the remnant's thermal energy is lost in 0.1-10 Myr by line
cooling, whereas, for larger explosion energies, the remnant expands even more
rapidly with decreasing interior density, and cools predominantly via inverse
Compton process. In higher mass halos, the gas density near the explosion site
remains high and the SN shock is heavily confined; the thermal energy of the
remnant is quickly radiated away by free-free emission, even if the total input
energy exceeds the binding energy of halos by two orders of magnitude. We show
that the efficiency of halo destruction is determined not only by the explosion
energy but also by the gas density profile, and thus controlled by radiative
feedback prior to the explosion. Several implications of our results for the
formation of first quasars and second-generation stars in the universe are also
discussed.

with N1 being an AGN, and rather suggests that the compact nonthermal radio
emission is produced by an extremely high luminous individual radio supernova
(RSN), or a combination of unresolved emission from nested supernova remnants
(SNR), luminous RSNe, or both. Component N2 is partly resolved out into several
compact radio sources --none of which clearly dominates-- and a region of
extended emission about 30 pc in size. The integrated spectral index of this

emission peaks at different frequencies and is partially free-free absorbed.

at low (40, 90 GHz) and one at high (150, 350 GHz) frequencies and thus
dominated by the synchrotron and thermal dust emission, respectively. We use a
parallel version of the FASTICA code to explore a substantial parameter space
including Gaussian pixel noise level, observed sky area and the amplitude of
the foreground emission and employ large Monte Carlo simulations to quantify
errors and biases pertinent to the reconstruction for different choices of the

FASTICA performs extremely well even in the cases when the B mode CMB signal is

amplitude is comparable with the total CMB polarized emission. In addition we

noise from an additional (noise) junction on the Coulomb blockaded Josephson
junction in high-impedance environment. Asymmetry of shot noise characterized
by its odd moments results in asymmetry of the $IV$ curve of the Josephson
junction. At high currents through the noise junction the $IV$ curve is very
sensitive to electron counting statistics. The theory is generalized on another
type of noise (phase noise of a monochromatic AC input), on a normal Coulomb
blockaded tunnel junction. The effect of shot noise on the $IV$ curve of a
superconducting Josephson junction in low-impedance environment is also
analyzed. From this effect one can obtain information on the time necessary for
an electron to tunnel through the junction responsible for shot noise. In
summary, the analysis demonstrates, that the low-bias part of the $IV$ curves
of tunnel junctions can be a sensitive probe of various types of noise.

microcanonical ensemble. Classically this is the manifold of all points in the
$N-$body phase space with the given total energy. Due to Boltzmann's principle,
$e^S=tr(\delta(E-H))$, its geometrical size is related to the entropy
$S(E,N,...)$. This definition does not invoke any information theory, no
thermodynamic limit, no extensivity, and no homogeneity assumption, as are
needed in conventional (canonical) thermo-statistics. Therefore, it describes
the equilibrium statistics of extensive as well of non-extensive systems. Due
to this fact it is the {\em fundamental} definition of any classical
equilibrium statistics. It can address nuclei and astrophysical objects as
well. All kind of phase transitions can be distinguished sharply and uniquely
for even small systems. It is further shown that the second law is a natural
consequence of the statistical nature of thermodynamics which describes all
systems with the same -- redundant -- set of few control parameters
simultaneously. It has nothing to do with the thermodynamic limit. It even
works in systems which are by far {\em larger} than any thermodynamic ""limit"".

the existence of an energy (heat) flow from one system to another.
Consequently, in the case of a black hole evaporation in the empty space, the
Hawking field should be in a nonequilibrium state. Hence the total behaviour of
the evaporation, for example the time evolution of the total entropy, should be
analysed with a nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Hawking field. This
manuscript explains briefly the way of constructing a nonequilibrium

are introduced. The duality cascade is then constructed in field theory and in
its dual supergravity description. Among the newly published results: it is
shown why supergravity sees the cascade as smooth; how the two holomorphic
couplings (dilaton and integrated two-form in supergravity) are related to the
three physical couplings in the gauge theory; that there are actually twice as

space-times which interpolate from a collapsing phase to an expanding phase. We
begin by considering the classical propagation of strings on space-times with
isotropic and anisotropic cosmological singularities. We find that cosmological
singularities fall into two classes, in the first class the string evolution is
well behaved all the way up to the singularity, whilst in the second class it
becomes ill-defined. Then assuming the singularities are regulated by string
scale corrections, we consider the implications of the propagation through a
`bounce'. It is known that as we evolve through a bounce, quantum strings will
become excited giving rise to `particle transmutation'. We reconsider this
effect, giving qualitative arguments for the amount of excitation for each
class. We find that strings whose physical wavelength at the bounce is less
that $\sqrt{\alpha'}$ inevitably emerge in highly excited states, and that in
this regime there is an interesting correspondence between strings on
anisotropic cosmological space-times and plane waves. We argue that long
wavelength modes, such as those describing cosmological perturbations, will
also emerge in mildly excited string scale mass states. Finally we discuss the
relevance of this to the propagation of cosmological perturbations in models

  Statitistics. The paper in AoS has certain proofs abbreviated that are given
  here in detail",,,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  We attempt to recover an $n$-dimensional vector observed in white noise,
where $n$ is large and the vector is known to be sparse, but the degree of
sparsity is unknown. We consider three different ways of defining sparsity of a
vector: using the fraction of nonzero terms; imposing power-law decay bounds on
the ordered entries; and controlling the $\ell_p$ norm for $p$ small. We obtain
a procedure which is asymptotically minimax for $\ell^r$ loss, simultaneously
throughout a range of such sparsity classes.
  The optimal procedure is a data-adaptive thresholding scheme, driven by
control of the {\it False Discovery Rate} (FDR). FDR control is a relatively
recent innovation in simultaneous testing, ensuring that at most a certain
fraction of the rejected null hypotheses will correspond to false rejections.
  In our treatment, the FDR control parameter $q_n$ also plays a determining
role in asymptotic minimaxity. If $q = \lim q_n \in [0,1/2]$ and also $q_n >
\gamma/\log(n)$ we get sharp asymptotic minimaxity, simultaneously, over a wide
range of sparse parameter spaces and loss functions. On the other hand, $ q =
\lim q_n \in (1/2,1]$, forces the risk to exceed the minimax risk by a factor
growing with $q$.
  To our knowledge, this relation between ideas in simultaneous inference and
asymptotic decision theory is new.
  Our work provides a new perspective on a class of model selection rules which
has been introduced recently by several authors. These new rules impose
complexity penalization of the form $2 \cdot \log({potential model size} /
{actual model size})$. We exhibit a close connection with FDR-controlling
procedures under stringent control of the false discovery rate.

comparative approach is employed to review the role of electrification in the
atmospheres of other planets and their moons. This paper reviews planetary
atmospheric electricity including ionisation and ion-aerosol interactions. The
conditions necessary for a global electric circuit, and the likelihood of
meeting these conditions in other planetary atmospheres are briefly discussed.
Atmospheric electrification could be important throughout the Solar System,
particularly at the outer planets which receive little solar radiation,
increasing the significance of electrical forces. Nucleation onto atmospheric
ions has been predicted to affect the evolution and lifetime of haze layers on
Titan, Neptune, and Triton. Atmospheric electrical processes on Titan,
pre-Huygens, are summarised. Closer to Earth, heating from solar radiation
dominates planetary meteorology; however Mars may have a global circuit based
on electrical discharges from dust storms. There is a need for direct
measurements of planetary atmospheric electrification, in particular on Mars,
to assess the risk for future missions. Theoretical understanding could be
increased by cross-disciplinary work to modify and update models and
parameterisations initially developed for specific planetary atmospheres to
make them more broadly applicable.

including experimentally-observed adhesion-driven contact inhibition of
chemotaxis in the simulation causes randomly-distributed cells to organize into
networks and cell aggregates to sprout, reproducing aspects of both de novo and
sprouting blood-vessel growth. We discuss two branching instabilities
responsible for our results. Cells at the surfaces of cell clusters attempting
to migrate to the centers of the clusters produce a buckling instability. In a
model variant that eliminates the surface-normal force, a dissipative mechanism
drives sprouting, with the secreted chemical acting both as a chemoattractant
and as an inhibitor of pseudopod extension. The branching instabilities
responsible for our results, which result from contact inhibition of
chemotaxis, are both generic developmental mechanisms and interesting examples
of unusual patterning instabilities.

way. We study the process of chirality formation of nucleosome with Brownian
dynamics simulation. We model the histone octamer with a quantitatively
adjustable chirality: left-handed, right-handed or non-chiral, and simulate the
dynamical wrapping process of a DNA molecule on it. We find that the chirality
of a nucleosome formed is strongly dependent on that of the histone octamer,
and different chiralities of the histone octamer induce its different rotation
directions in the wrapping process of DNA. In addition, a very weak chirality
of the histone octamer is quite enough for sustaining the correct chirality of
the nucleosome formed. We also show that the chirality of a nucleosome may be
broken at elevated temperature.

with a single mode of the cavity, and the off-resonance case was considered
(namely the atomic transition frequency is detuned from the single mode cavity

finite temperature correction is considered, in view of the recent discussion

the difference between the Casimir pressures at two different temperatures,

experimentally attainable in the near future, and it will be a critical test of
