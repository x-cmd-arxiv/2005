of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stars
on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account
for radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000
km/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5
Msun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.
In contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following
circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to
produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps
immersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for
the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs
with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive
to the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an
almost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The
cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give
rise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales
of 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and
1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never
forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.
Our work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,
the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher
than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion
modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the
wind properties and stellar orbits.

galaxies below the CO brightness limit used by Sakamoto et al. Even in these
CO-faint galaxies we show that high central gas concentrations are more common
in barred galaxies, consistent with radial inflow driven by the bar. However,
there is a significant population of early-type (Sa--Sbc) barred spirals (6 of
19) that have little or no molecular gas detected in the nuclear region and out
to the bar co-rotation radius. In these galaxies, the bar has already driven
most of the gas within the bar to the nuclear region, where it has been
consumed by star formation. The median nuclear gas mass is over four times
higher in early type bars; since the gas consumption rate is an order of
magnitude higher in early type bars, early types must have significantly higher
bar-driven inflows. The lower inflow rates in late type bars can be attributed
to differences in bar structure between early and late types. Despite
bar-driven inflows, the data indicate that it is highly unlikely for a late
type galaxy to evolve into an early type via bar-induced gas inflow.
Nonetheless, secular evolutionary processes are undoubtedly present, and
pseudo-bulges are inevitable; evidence for pseudo-bulges is likely to be
clearest in early-type galaxies because of their high gas inflow rates and
higher star formation activity (abridged).

lensing magnification due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight, and
potential source peculiar velocities. We find that weak lensing errors exceed
other sources of uncertainties by nearly an order of magnitude. Under the
plausible assumption that BH mergers are accompanied by gas accretion leading
to Eddington-limited quasar activity, we then compute the number of quasars
that would be found in a typical LISA error volume, as a function of BH mass
and redshift. We find that low redshifts offer the best opportunities to
identify quasar counterparts to cosmological standard sirens, and that the LISA
error volume will typically contain a single near-Eddington quasar at z=1. This
will allow a straightforward test of the hypothesis that BH mergers are
accompanied by bright quasar activity and, if the hypothesis proves correct,
will guarantee the identification of a unique quasar counterpart. This would
yield unprecedented tests of the physics of SMBH accretion, and offer an

SagDIG has been able to maintain a very low mean metallicity (-2.2<[Fe/H]<-1.9)

galaxies share an ancient (~10 Gyr) initial episode of star formation. Thus, at

source experienced in 1999 and in 2001, and successively decreased. Although
the excellent XMM-Newton spectral resolution should in principle allow us to
detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum with BeppoSAX
and interpreted as a cyclotron feature, we found no absorption features,
neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra. We
discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in the BeppoSAX data
may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and
intrinsically variable. We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches
and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease,
in the framework of the magnetar model.

recently published catalogue by Nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accurate
spatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearby
stars. To optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterize
the properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. We find that stars with
a common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbital
parameters; in particular, between the apocentre A and pericentre P, as well as
their z-angular momentum (L_z). In the APL-space, such stars are expected to
cluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity.
  The APL space for the Nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure,
much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral arms
and the Galactic bar. However, our analysis also reveals a statistically
significant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity,
analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. Besides being dynamically
peculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicity
and age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-Galactic
provenance. It is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent Groups
with characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspond
to the remains of disrupted satellites. [abridged]

a systematic way the variation of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower
and upper kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in the low-mass X-ray binary
4U1636-536, over a frequency range from ~550 Hz to ~1200 Hz. When represented
in a quality factor versus frequency diagram, the upper and lower QPOs follow
two different tracks, suggesting that they are distinct phenomena, although not
completely independent because the frequency difference of the two QPOs, when
detected simultaneously, remains within ~60 Hz of half the neutron star spin
frequency (at 581 Hz). The quality factor of the lower kHz QPO increases with
frequency up to a maximum of ~200 at ~850 Hz, then drops precipitously to Q~50
at the highest detected frequencies ~920 Hz. A ceiling of the lower QPO
frequencies at 920 Hz is also clearly seen in a frequency versus count rate
diagram.
  The quality factor provides a measure of the coherence of the underlying
oscillator. For exponentially damped sinusoidal shots, the highest Q observed
corresponds to an oscillator coherence time of ~ 0.1 seconds. All existing QPO
models face challenges in explaining such a long coherence time and the
significantly different behaviours of the quality factors of the upper and
lower QPOs reported here. It is therefore difficult to be certain of the
implications of the abrupt change in the lower QPO at ~850 Hz. We discuss
various possible causes, including that the drop in coherence is ultimately
caused by effects related to the innermost stable circular orbit (abridged).

the peak of 8.3 micron extinction as measured by the Midcourse Space Experiment
satellite. Detailed radiative transfer codes are applied to constrain the
cores' physical conditions to address the key question: Do these IRDC-cores
harbour luminous sources? The results of the continuum model, expressed in the
$\chi^2$ quality-of-fit parameter, are also constrained by the absence of 100
micron emission from IRAS. For the sub-mm emission peaks this shows that
sources of 300 solar luminosities are embedded within the cores. For the
extinction peak, the combination of continuum and HCO+ line modelling indicates
that a heating source is present as well. Furthermore, the line model provides
constraints on the clumpiness of the medium. All three cores have similar
masses of about 70-150 solar masses and similar density structures. The
extinction peak differs from the other two cores by hosting a much weaker

half of which are likely to be background AGN. One source is coincident with
the optical nucleus and may be a low-luminosity AGN. Only two sources with an
X-ray luminosity greater than 10$^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-5.0 keV band

expected to detect 6 such luminous sources if the XRB population scales
linearly with optical magnitude of the host galaxy. NGC 5102 has an unusually
low number of XRBs. NGC 5102 is unusually blue for its morphological type, and
has undergone at least two recent bursts of star formation. We present the
results of optical/UV spectral synthesis analysis and demonstrate that a
significant fraction ($>$50%) of the stars in this galaxy are comparatively
young ($<3\times10^9$ years old). If the lack of X-ray binaries is related to
the relative youth of most of the stars, this would support models of LMXB
formation and evolution that require wide binaries to shed angular momentum on
a timescale of Gyrs. We find that NGC 5102 has an unusually low specific
frequency of globular clusters ($S_N\sim$0.4), which could also explain the
lack of LMXBs. We also detect diffuse X-ray emission in the central $\sim$1 kpc

part, the source followed a continuous spectral softening, with the peak of the
spectral energy distribution shifting from 100 keV down to a few keV. However
the thermal disk and the hard X-ray components had a similar intensity,
indicating that the source was in an intermediate state throughout our
observations and evolving toward the soft state. In the second part of our
observations, the ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL light curve showed a strong flaring
activity. Two flare events lasting about 1 day each have been detected with SPI
and are probably due to instabilities in the accretion disk associated with the
state transition. During these flares, the low (1.5-12 keV) and high (20-200
keV) energy fluxes monitored with ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL, are correlated and
the spectral shape (above 20 keV) remains unchanged while the luminosity

of quasiparticles. The systematics of the sign of $q$ is shown to reflect the
sign of the logarithmic derivative of the density of states and the inverse
mass tensor of the quasiparticles, explaining the systematics of experiments.

are explained. The case of non-Fermi liquid near the quantum critical point

network on the distribution of the resistance fluctuations. Precisely, we
consider quasi-one-dimensional networks elongated along the direction of the
applied current or trasversal to it. A significant anisotropy is found for the

on unidirectional lateral superlattices with periods ranging from a=92 to 184
nm. Fourier analysis reveals the second (and the third) harmonics along with
the fundamental oscillation for a>=138 nm (184 nm) at low-enough temperature,
evincing the presence of corresponding harmonics in the profile of the
potential modulation. The harmonics manifest themselves in CO with demagnified
amplitude due to the low-pass filtering action of the thermal damping factor;
with a suitable consideration of the damping effect, the harmonics of the
modulation potential are found to have the amplitudes V_2 and V_3 up to roughly
30% of that of the fundamental component V_1, despite the small ratio of the
period a to the depth d = 99 nm of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) from
the surface. The dependence of V_n on a indicates that the fundamental
component originates at the surface, while the higher harmonics arise from the
effect of the strain that penetrates down into subsurface. The manipulation of
high harmonics thus provides a useful technique to introduce small length-scale
modulation into high-mobility 2DEGs located deep inside the wafer.

to investigating random maps and finding analytical results for attractors in
random Boolean networks with the corresponding topology. Approximating some
other non-chaotic networks to be of this class, we apply the analytic results
to them. For this approximation, we observe a strikingly good agreement on the
numbers of attractors of various lengths. We also investigate observables
related to the average number of attractors in relation to the typical number
of attractors. Here, we find strong differences that highlight the difficulties
in making direct comparisons between random Boolean networks and real systems.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving some results
for random maps. These results include the distribution of the number of
components in random maps, along with asymptotic expansions for cumulants up to
the 4th order.

densitized lapse function instead of the lapse function in the variational
principle approach to the Einstein equations. The spatial metric variational
equations then become the Ricci evolution equations, which are then
supplemented by the Einstein constraints which result from the variation with
respect to the densitized lapse and the usual shift vector field. In those
spatially homogeneous cases where the least disconnect occurs between the
general theory and the restricted symmetry scenario, the recent adjustment of
the conformal approach to solving the initial value problem resulting from
densitized lapse considerations is seen to be inherent in the use of
symmetry-adapted metric variables. The minimal distortion shift vector field is
a natural vector potential for the new York thin sandwich initial data approach
to the constraints, which in this case corresponds to the diagonal spatial
metric gauge. For generic spacetimes, the new approach suggests defining a new
minimal distortion shift gauge which agrees with the old gauge in the Taub time
gauge, but which also makes its defining differential equation agree with the
vector potential equation for solving the supermomentum constraint in any time
gauge.

of the electromagnetic current between nucleon states, with vacuum expectation
values of nucleons and/or the current. In the expansion of $\theta$, the
parity-odd part of the nucleon-current-nucleon three-point function contains
contributions not only from the parity-odd form factors but also from the
parity-even form factors multiplied by the parity-odd part of the nucleon
two-point function, and therefore the latter contribution must be subtracted to
extract $F_3$. We then perform an explicit lattice calculation employing the
domain-wall quark action with the RG improved gauge action in quenched QCD at
$a^{-1}\simeq 2$ GeV on a $16^3\times 32\times 16$ lattice. At the quark mass
$m_f a =0.03$, corresponding to $m_\pi/m_\rho \simeq 0.63$, we accumulate 730
configurations, which allow us to extract the parity-odd part in both two- and
three-point functions. Employing two different Dirac $\gamma$ matrix
projections, we show that a consistent value for $F_3$ cannot be obtained
without the subtraction described above. We obtain $F_3(q^2\simeq 0.58

turn out to be equal or closely related in several classes of processes
differing by the replacement of certain final or initial states with their

computing the Sudakov corrections in the framework of superfield perturbation
theory. As a simple application, we derive in full details an extended complete

generalized GFT models that can be used to describe 3D quantum gravity coupled

group leading to pure quantum gravity by the twisted product of the group with
its dual --the so-called Drinfeld double of the group. The Drinfeld double is a
quantum group in that it is an algebra that is both non-commutative and
non-cocommutative, and special care is needed to define group field theory for

interest is a new topological model that is the ``Ponzano-Regge'' model for the
Drinfeld double. However, as we show, this model does not describe point
particles. Motivated by the GFT considerations, we consider a more general
class of models that are defined using not GFT, but the so-called chain mail

  Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 50, 3500-3530 (2006)",,,"math.ST math.NA math.PR stat.TH",,"  Advances in computing power enable more widespread use of the mode, which is
a natural measure of central tendency since, as the most probable value, it is
not influenced by the tails in the distribution. The properties of the
half-sample mode, which is a simple and fast estimator of the mode of a
continuous distribution, are studied. The half-sample mode is less sensitive to
outliers than most other estimators of location, including many other low-bias
estimators of the mode. Its breakdown point is one half, equal to that of the
median. However, because of its finite rejection point, the half-sample mode is
much less sensitive to outliers that are all either greater or less than the
other values of the sample. This is confirmed by applying the mode estimator
and the median to samples drawn from normal, lognormal, and Pareto
distributions contaminated by outliers. It is also shown that the half-sample
mode, in combination with a robust scale estimator, is a highly robust starting
point for iterative robust location estimators such as Huber's M-estimator. The
half-sample mode can easily be generalized to modal intervals containing more
or less than half of the sample. An application of such an estimator to the
finding of collision points in high-energy proton-proton interactions is
presented.

recently reported [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 94}, 134102 (2005)] that if

steady state. Here we study this behavior by comparing the dynamics of a map of
an array of $N$ delayed-coupled maps with the dynamics of a map with $N$
self-feedback delayed loops. If $N$ is sufficiently large, the dynamics of a
map of the array is similar to the dynamics of a map with self-feedback loops
with the same delay times. Several delayed loops stabilize the fixed point,
when the delays are not the same; however, the distribution of delays plays a
key role: if the delays are all odd a periodic orbit (and not the fixed point)
is stabilized. We present a linear stability analysis and apply some
mathematical theorems that explain the numerical results.

neglect interaction of the quarks with the medium. At the other extreme we
generate momenta of charm quarks in thermal equilibrium with the expanding

are made for J/Psi formation in Au-Au interactions at RHIC. We find that for
the case in which charm quark momenta are unchanged from the pQCD production

the result of the reorganisation of the internal U-shaped mesentery of the

Under this scenario, loops of the mesentery developed between five hydraulic
bulges by three different mechanisms: (1) by the early formation of two
additional loops resulting directly in five hydraulic bulges, (2) by the
subsequent formation of two additional loops resulting in the formation of
initially three and then five hydraulic bulges or (3) by the inflation of the
body without formation of loops. Accordingly there are at least three main
evolutionary pathways within the echinoderms. The anatomical structures, such
as the ambulacral system or the skeletal capsule, which characterize the

pathways various body structures can be derived matching those found in fossil

echinoderms most likely evolved from the direct-pentaradial pathway whereas
triradiate echinoderms and those which show a pentaradial organisation

structural similarities, but with different substrate specificity. Previous
experiments have demonstrated the critical role of the two loops outside the
binding pocket in controlling the specificity of the two enzymes. To understand
the mechanism of such a control of specificity by distant loops, we have used
the Gaussian Network Model to study the dynamic properties of trypsin and
chymotrypsin and the roles played by the two loops. A clustering method was
introduced to analyze the correlated motions of residues. We have found that
trypsin and chymotrypsin have distinct dynamic signatures in the two loop
regions which are in turn highly correlated with motions of certain residues in
the binding pockets. Interestingly, replacing the two loops of trypsin with
those of chymotrypsin changes the motion style of trypsin to chymotrypsin-like,
whereas the same experimental replacement was shown necessary to make trypsin
have chymotrypsin's enzyme specificity and activity. These results suggest that
the cooperative motions of the two loops and the substrate-binding sites
contribute to the activity and substrate specificity of trypsin and

evolution of this group can be presented in a scenario which describes how a
bilateral ancestor (an enteropneust-like organism) gradually evolved into a
pentaradial echinoderm. According to this scenario, the arms are outgrowths
from the anterior/posterior body axis of the bilateral pterobranchia-like
intermediate. These outgrowths developed when the originally U-shaped mesentery
of the intestinal tract formed loops, and correspondingly, the tensile chords
of the mesentery were attached to the body wall in five loops. The wall faces
between these regions of tensile chords could bulge out under the hydraulic
pressure of the body coelom. The originally more or less round body cavity was
deformed into a pneu with five bulges. The loops of the gut forced a roughly
symmetric arrangement, which was enhanced by a physical fact: five pneus as
well as one pneu with five internal tethers, naturally adopt a pentaradial
pattern of ""minimum contact surfaces"", as the most economic arrangement. These
evolutionary transformations were accompanied by certain histological
modifications, such as the development of mutable connective tissues and
skeletal elements that fused to ossicles and provided shape stabilization in
the form of a calcareous skeleton in the tissues of the body wall. The
resultant organism was an ancestral eleutherozoan echinoderm (Ur-Echinoderm).

both of the above examples. The dual protocols responsible for this
decomposition are the ``feedback father'' (FF) protocol and the ``fully quantum

A 72, 052332 (2005)","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.052332",,"quant-ph",,"  Photonic quantum information processing schemes, such as linear optics
quantum computing, and other experiments relying on single-photon interference,
inherently require complete photon indistinguishability to enable the desired
photonic interactions to take place. Mode-mismatch is the dominant cause of
photon distinguishability in optical circuits. Here we study the effects of
photon wave-packet shape on tolerance against the effects of mode-mismatch in
linear optical circuits, and show that Gaussian distributed photons with large
bandwidth are optimal. The result is general and holds for arbitrary linear
optical circuits, including ones which allow for post-selection and classical
feed-forward.

is presented. Existing models are then improved by considering more general
working conditions. Especially, the mazer physics is investigated in the
situation where a detuning between the cavity mode and the atomic transition
frequency is present. Interesting new effects are pointed out. Especially, it
is shown that the cavity may slow down or speed up the atoms according to the
sign of the detuning and that the induced emission process may be completely
blocked by use of a positive detuning. The transmission probability of
ultracold atoms through a micromaser is also studied and we generalize previous
results established in the resonant case. In particular, it is shown that the
velocity selection of cold atoms passing through the micromaser can be very
easily tuned and enhanced using a nonresonant field inside the cavity. This
manuscript is a summary of Martin's master thesis and articles [Phys. Rev. A
67, 053804 (2003)] and [Eur. Phys. J. D 29, 133 (2004)].

  version","Concepts Phys. 2 (2005) 49",,,"quant-ph",,"  The paper contains a proposal for an energy and time representation. We
construct modes that correspond to fuzzy distributions around discrete values
of energy or time. The modes form an orthogonal and complete set in the space
of square integrable functions. Energy and time are self adjoint in the space
spanned by the modes. The widths of the modes are analyzed as well as their
energy-time uncertainty relations. The lower uncertainty attainable for the
modes is shown. We also show times of arrival for massless particles.

linear equation is positive, which is the main source of the fundamental
difference between classical and quantum mechanics.

(for example, the Levi-Civita connection) and a closed 2-form (magnetic field)
we define a Hilbert algebra structure in the space $L^2(T^*\cal M)$ and
construct an irreducible representation of this algebra in $L^2(\cal M)$. This
algebra is automatically extended to polynomial in momenta functions and
distributions. Under some natural conditions this algebra is unique. The
non-commutative product over $T^*\cal M$ is given by an explicit integral
formula. This product is exact (not formal) and is expressed in invariant
geometrical terms. Our analysis reveals this product has a front, which is
described in terms of geodesic triangles in $\cal M$. The quantization of
$\delta$-functions induces a family of symplectic reflections in $T^*\cal M$
and generates a magneto-geodesic connection $\Gamma$ on $T^*\cal M$. This
symplectic connection entangles, on the phase space level, the original affine
structure on $\cal M$ and the magnetic field. In the classical approximation,
the $\hbar^2$-part of the quantum product contains the Ricci curvature of
$\Gamma$ and a magneto-geodesic coupling tensor.

noiseless passive operations. Both single and repeated uses of the device are
optimized analytically and it is proven that in the latter case the squeezing
converges exponentially fast to its asymptotic optimum, which we determine
explicitly. For the case of multiple iterations we show that the optimum can be
achieved with fixed intermediate passive operations. Finally, we relate the
results to the generation of entanglement and derive the maximal two-mode
entanglement achievable within the considered scenario.
