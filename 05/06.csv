(P3M) algorithm for distributed memory clusters. The GRACOS (GRAvitational
COSmology) code uses a hybrid method for both computation and domain
decomposition. Long-range forces are computed using a Fourier transform gravity
solver on a regular mesh; the mesh is distributed across parallel processes
using a static one-dimensional slab domain decomposition. Short-range forces
are computed by direct summation of close pairs; particles are distributed
using a dynamic domain decomposition based on a space-filling Hilbert curve. A
nearly-optimal method was devised to dynamically repartition the particle
distribution so as to maintain load balance even for extremely inhomogeneous
mass distributions. Tests using $800^3$ simulations on a 40-processor beowulf
cluster showed good load balance and scalability up to 80 processes. We discuss
the limits on scalability imposed by communication and extreme clustering and
suggest how they may be removed by extending our algorithm to include adaptive
mesh refinement.

radio core, a doubly-imaged lobe and a second lobe that is probably
quadruply-imaged. The maximum image separation is 1.16 arcseconds. The VLBA
resolves the most magnified image of the flat-spectrum radio core into a number
of sub-components spread across approximately 20 milli-arcseconds. Optical and
near-infrared imaging with the ACS and NICMOS cameras on the HST show that
there are two galaxies along the line of sight to the lensed source, as was
previously discovered by optical spectroscopy. The nearer galaxy at z=0.0896 is
a small blue irregular, while the more distant galaxy at z=0.6196 is an
elliptical type and appears to contribute most of the lensing effect. The host
galaxy of the lensed source is visible in NICMOS imaging as a set of arcs that
form an almost complete Einstein ring. Mass modelling using non-parametric
techniques can reproduce the ring and indicates that the irregular galaxy has a
(localised) effect on the flux density distribution in the Einstein ring at the
5-10% level.

position angle of 58 degrees, with spatial resolution 0.2 arcseconds across and
0.1 arcseconds along each slit. A spectral resolving power of ~ 9,000 with the
G430M grating gave velocity measurements accurate to ~ 34 km/s. A kinematic

kinematic models of biconical radial outflow developed for low-dispersion
spectra at two slit positions. The new high-resolution spectra permit the
measurement of accurate velocity dispersions for each radial-velocity

near the nucleus, and generally decreases with increasing distance to about 100
km/s in the extended narrow-line region (ENLR), starting at about 6 arcseconds
from the nucleus. In addition to the bright emission knots, which generally fit
our model, there are faint high velocity clouds which do not fit the biconical
outflow pattern of our kinematic model. These faint clouds occur at the
turnover points of the outflowing bright clouds. We suggest possible scenarios
that could explain these rogue clouds: (1) backflow resulting from shocks and
(2) outflow outside of the bicones, although the latter does not explain how
the knots are ionized and accelerated. A comparison of our observations with a
high-resolution radio map shows that there is no evidence that the kinematics
of the NLR clouds are affected by the radio lobes that comprise the inner jet.

large number of young/intermediate age clusters (~2 Gyr) within the selected

still not been well quantified. In this paper the success of two
template-fitting photometric redshift codes (IMPZ and HYPERZ) at reliably
returning Av in addition to redshift is explored. New data on the CNOC2
spectroscopic sample of 0.2<z<0.7 galaxies are presented. These data allow us
to estimate Av values from the observed Balmer decrements. We also investigate
whether the empirical value of gamma=0.44, the ratio between gas- and star-
derived extinction, as determined by Calzetti (2001), is necessarily the best
value for this sample.
  When comparing the two codes to the Balmer-derived Av, a correlation between
the photometrically derived Av, Phot-Av, and the Balmer-Av is found. The
correlation is improved when the empirical value of gamma=0.44 is allowed to
vary. From least-squares-fitting the minimum in the reduced chi^2 distribution
is found for gamma~0.25 +/- 0.2. For the sample of galaxies here, the factor of
two difference in covering factor implied by the Calzetti ratio is found to be
plausible. The CNOC2 galaxies with detected Balmer lines have some preference
for an increased covering factor difference, which would perhaps imply they are
undergoing more rapid, `bursty' star formation than the galaxies Calzetti used
in her derivation.

most probably more accurate. We have made an extensive comparison with other

  Among the results we note the following: We find [O/Fe] from the O I IR-
triplet lines to possibly increase beyond [Fe/H]=-1.0, though considerably less
than obtained by others from abundances based on OH lines. We find correlations
among the deviations for individual stars from the trends of individual alpha
elements relative to Fe. This may support the idea that the formation of the
Halo stars occurred in smaller systems with different star formation rates. We
verify the finding by Gratton et al. (2003b) that stars that do not participate
in the rotation of the galactic disk show a lower mean and larger spread in
[alpha/Fe] than stars participating in the general rotation. The latter stars
also seem to show some correlation between [alpha/Fe] and rotation speed. We
finally advocate that a spectroscopic study of a larger sample of halo stars
with well-defined selection criteria is very important, in addition to the very
considerable efforts that various groups have already made. (Abridged)

only two are contaminating low mass stars. When allowance is made for
incompleteness, the spectroscopic redshift distribution closely matches that
predicted earlier on the basis of photometric data. Our spectra are of
sufficient quality that we can address the important question of the nature and
homogeneity of the z>0.8 ERO population. A dominant old stellar population is
inferred for 75% of our spectroscopic sample; a higher fraction than that seen
in smaller, less-complete samples with broader photometric selection criteria
(e.g. R-K). However, only 28% have spectra with no evidence of recent star
formation activity, such as would be expected for a strictly passively-evolving
population. More than ~30% of our absorption line spectra are of the `E+A' type
with prominent Balmer absorption consistent, on average, with mass growth of
5-15% in the past Gyr. We use our spectroscopic redshifts to improve earlier
estimates of the spatial clustering of this population as well as to understand
the significant field-to-field variation. Our spectroscopy enables us to
pinpoint a filamentary structure at z=1.22 in the Chandra Deep Field South.
Overall, our study suggests that the bulk of the ERO population is an
established population of clustered massive galaxies undergoing intermittent
activity consistent with continued growth over the redshift interval 0.8<z<1.6.

53407.57, respectively. The count rate for the 3rd observation is 2.0+-0.4
times as high as that of the average of the first two observations. The
unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV source flux for the best-fit power-law model to the
source spectrum was (7.9+-2.5)x10^-14, (7.3+-2.0)x10^-14, and
(1.17+-0.22)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Chandra
observation, respectively. We find that this source flux is consistent with
that found by ROSAT [~(5.4+-2.4)x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1]. Under the assumption
that the interstellar extinction, N_H, does not vary between the observations,
we find that the blackbody temperature during the 2nd Chandra observation is
significantly higher than that during the 1st and 3rd observation. Furthermore,
the effective temperature of the neutron star derived from fitting an absorbed
blackbody or neutron star atmosphere model to the data is rather high in
comparison with many other neutron star soft X-ray transients in quiescence,
even during the 1st and 3rd observation. If we assume that the source quiescent
luminosity is similar to that measured for two other accretion powered
millisecond pulsars in quiescence, the distance to IGR J00291+5934 is 2.6-3.6

the galaxy-galaxy length (r_0 ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc) for N_CIV > 10^12.5 cm^-2.
Distortions in the redshift-space galaxy-CIV correlation function on small

Four of the five detected OVI absorption systems in our sample lie within 400

intergalactic gas within 1 h^-1 comoving Mpc of most galaxies, but for a
significant minority (~1/3) the absorption is weak or absent. We were unable to
identify any statistically significant differences between galaxies with weak
nearby HI absorption and the rest, although galaxies with weak absorption may
have higher star-formation rates. Galaxies near intergalactic CIV systems
appear to reside in relatively dense environments and to have distinctive

well-established member of a non-magnetic subclass of the chemically peculiar
stars of the upper main sequence. In this study we present first results of the
high-resolution survey of the HgII 3984 resonance line in the spectra of
rapidly rotating HgMn stars with atmospheric parameters similar to those of
alpha And. We use spectrum synthesis modelling and take advantage of the
Doppler resolution of the stellar surfaces to probe horizontal structure of
mercury distribution. Clear signatures of spots are found in the HgII 3984 line
profiles of HR 1185 and HR 8723. Two observations of the latter star separated
by two days give evidence for the line profile variability. We conclude that
inhomogeneous distribution of Hg is a common phenomenon for the rapidly

independently of the stellar evolutionary stage. These results establish
existence of a new class of spectrum variable spotted B-type stars. It is
suggested that the observed Hg inhomogeneities arise from dynamical

similar to the blue-shifted emission line gas seen in [OIII]\lambda5007

to explain the observed column densities of all the species except NeVIII,

time for the gas is ~10^5 yr, the consistency with the photoionization models
suggests that any possible interaction of absorbing material with the jet must
have taken place before ~10^5 yr. The abundance ratio of nitrogen to carbon is
close to Solar values, unlike in the case of most quasars, especially at
high-redshifts, which have super-Solar values. We observed 3C48 with the Giant

unable to reproduce the power-law variation observed at high energies in many

spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that includes an explicit
treatment of the energization occurring in the shock. Using a rigorous
eigenfunction expansion method based on the exact dynamical solution for the
velocity profile in the column, we obtain a closed-form expression for the
Green's function describing the upscattering of radiation injected into the
column from a monochromatic source located at the top of the thermal mound,
near the base of the flow. The Green's function is convolved with a Planck
distribution to calculate the radiation spectrum resulting from the
reprocessing of blackbody photons emitted by the thermal mound. We demonstrate
that the energization of the photons in the shock naturally produces an X-ray
spectrum with a power-law shape at high energies and a blackbody shape at low
energies, in agreement with many observations of accreting X-ray pulsars.

to the superfluid state in the paramagnetic limit, the order parameter
describing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase has an increasingly
complex structure with contributions from an increasing number of wavevectors.
This cascade of phase transitions is directly linked to the fact that, due to
the rotational invariance, all the wavevectors directions which can enter the
order parameter are degenerate. We study how this cascade of phase transitions
is modified when one takes into account the anisotropy arising in a real solid
state compound. For a simple model of anisotropy with elliptical dispersion
relation, we find surprisingly that the cascade of phase transitions is not
modified and the degeneracy with respect to the wavevector direction is still
present. When we take into account a deviation with respect to this elliptical
model, which is treated to first order in perturbation, we find that the
degeneracy is lifted and that, basically, a single wavevector is favored right
at the transition. However when one enters the superfluid phase, additional
wavevectors come in the order parameter and the cascade of transitions is still
present, though in a modified form.

neutrosophic set are proved. Chapter 2 defines the interval neutrosophic logic

order interval neutrosophic propositional logic and first order interval
neutrosophic predicate logic. The interval neutrosophic logic can reason and
model fuzzy, incomplete and inconsistent information. In this chapter, we also
design an interval neutrosophic inference system based on first order interval
neutrosophic predicate logic. The interval neutrosophic inference system can be
applied to decision making. Chapter 3 gives one application of interval
neutrosophic sets and logic in the field of relational databases. Neutrosophic
data model is the generalization of fuzzy data model and paraconsistent data
model. Here, we generalize various set-theoretic and relation-theoretic
operations of fuzzy data model to neutrosophic data model. Chapter 4 gives
another application of interval neutrosophic logic. A soft semantic Web

over the small components of quark fields with $|{\bf p}| < E + m_Q$, an
alternative quantization procedure is adopted to establish a basic theoretical
framework of heavy quark effective field theory (HQEFT) in the sense of
effective quantum field theory. The procedure concerns quantum generators of
Poincare group, Hilbert and Fock space, anticommutations and velocity
super-selection rule, propagator and Feynman rules, finite mass corrections,
trivialization of gluon couplings and renormalization of Wilson loop. The
Lorentz invariance and discrete symmetries in HQEFT are explicitly illustrated.
Some new symmetries in the infinite mass limit are discussed. Weak transition
matrix elements and masses of hadrons in HQEFT are well defined to display a
manifest spin-flavor symmetry and $1/m_Q$ corrections. A simple trace
formulation approach is explicitly demonstrated by using LSZ reduction formula
in HQEFT, and shown to be very useful for parameterizing the transition form
factors via $1/m_Q$ expansion. As the heavy quark and antiquark fields in HQEFT
are treated on the same footing in a fully symmetric way, the quark-antiquark
coupling terms naturally appear and play important roles for simplifying the
structure of transition matrix elements, and for understanding the concept of
`dressed heavy quark' - hadron duality. In the case that the `longitudinal' and
`transverse' residual momenta of heavy quark are at the same order of power
counting, HQEFT provides a consistent approach for systematically analyzing
heavy quark expansion in terms of $1/m_Q$. Some interesting features in
applications of HQEFT to heavy hadron systems are briefly outlined.

examples of these manifolds. To find an independent evidence of the

nonlinear sigma models on the target spaces $CP^{N-1}=SU(N)/[SU(N-1)\times

which is obtained by replacing the Cartesian components of $\bm{r}$ by the
Cartesian components of $\nabla$ in the regular solid harmonic
${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\bm{r})$, is an irreducible spherical tensor of rank
$\ell$. Accordingly, its application to a scalar function produces an
irreducible spherical tensor of rank $\ell$. Thus, it is in principle
sufficient to consider only multicenter integrals of scalar functions: Higher
angular momentum states can be generated by differentiation with respect to the
nuclear coordinates. Many of the properties of ${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m}
(\nabla)$ can be understood easily with the help of an old theorem on
differentiation by Hobson [Proc. London Math. Soc. {\bf 24}, 54 - 67 (1892)].
It follows from Hobson's theorem that some scalar functions of considerable
relevance as for example the Coulomb potential, Gaussian functions, or reduced
Bessel functions produce particularly compact results if
${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla)$ is applied to them. Fourier transformation
is very helpful to understand the properties of ${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m}
(\nabla)$ since it produces ${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (-\mathrm{i} \bm{p})$. It
is also possible to apply ${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla)$ to generalized
functions, yielding for instance the spherical delta function
$\delta_{\ell}^{m} (\bm{r})$. The differential operator
${\mathcal{Y}}_{\ell}^{m} (\nabla)$ can also be used for the derivation of
pointwise convergent addition theorems. The feasibility of this approach is
demonstrated by deriving the addition theorem of $r^{\nu}

positive planar measure and with dimension 2 such that each point in $E$ can be
joined to $\infty$ by one or several curves in $\C$ such that all curves are
disjoint from each other and from $E$, and so that their union has Hausdorff
dimension 1. We can even arrange things so that every point in $\C$ which is
not on one of these curves is in $E$. These examples have been discovered very
recently; they arise quite naturally in the context of complex dynamics, more
precisely in the iteration theory of simple maps such as $z\mapsto \pi\sin(z)$.

hence the need for a stabilization technique, which we choose of the
Brezzi-Pitk\""aranta type. The scheme features two essential properties: the
discrete gradient is the transposed of the divergence terms and the discrete
trilinear form associated to nonlinear advective terms vanishes on discrete
divergence free velocity fields. As a consequence, the scheme is proved to be
unconditionally stable and convergent for the Stokes problem, the steady and
the transient Navier-Stokes equations. In this latter case, for a given
sequence of approximate solutions computed on meshes the size of which tends to
zero, we prove, up to a subsequence, the $L^2$-convergence of the components of
the velocity, and, in the steady case, the weak $L^2$-convergence of the
pressure. The proof relies on the study of space and time translates of
approximate solutions, which allows the application of Kolmogorov's theorem.
The limit of this subsequence is then shown to be a weak solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical examples are performed to obtain numerical
convergence rates in both the linear and the nonlinear case.

dynamics models to study the dispersal of the Neolithic in Europe from a
localized area in the Near East, solving the two-dimensional reaction-diffusion
equation on a spherical surface. We focus on the role of major river paths and
coastlines in the advance of farming to model the rapid advances of the Linear
Pottery (LBK) and the Impressed Ware traditions along the Danube-Rhine corridor
and the Mediterranean coastline respectively. We argue that the random walk of
individuals, which results in diffusion of the population, can be anisotropic
in those areas. The standard reaction-diffusion equation is thus supplemented
with advection-like terms confined to the proximity of major rivers and
coastlines. The model allows for the spatial variation in both the human
mobility (diffusivity) and the carrying capacity of landscapes, reflecting the
local altitude and latitude. This approach can easily be generalised to include
other environmental factors, such as the bioproductivity of landscapes. Our
model successfully accounts for the regional variations in the spread of the
Neolithic, consistent with the radiocarbon dated data, and reproduces a time
delay in the spread of farming to the Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.

quantum channels carrying a finite average number of massive bosons and
fermions. The maximum capacity is attained by transferring the Fock states
generated from the grand-canonical ensemble. Interestingly, the channel
capacity for a Bose gas indicates the onset of a Bose-Einstein condensation, by
changing its qualitative behavior at the criticality, while for a channel
carrying weakly attractive fermions, it exhibits the signatures of
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer transition. We also show that for noninteracting
particles, fermions are better carriers of information than bosons.

Then, moving on to realistic devices that can only detect the position of the

  Article",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This pedagogical review presents the proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in
the form of an efficient classical algorithm for compiling an arbitrary
single-qubit gate into a sequence of gates from a fixed and finite set. The
algorithm can be used, for example, to compile Shor's algorithm, which uses
rotations of $\pi / 2^k$, into an efficient fault-tolerant form using only
Hadamard, controlled-{\sc not}, and $\pi / 8$ gates. The algorithm runs in
$O(\log^{2.71}(1/\epsilon))$ time, and produces as output a sequence of
$O(\log^{3.97}(1/\epsilon))$ quantum gates which is guaranteed to approximate
the desired quantum gate to an accuracy within $\epsilon > 0$. We also explain
how the algorithm can be generalized to apply to multi-qubit gates and to gates
from $SU(d)$.

storage in decoherence processes. Redundancy has been proposed as a
prerequisite for objectivity, the defining property of classical objects. We
consider two ensembles of states for a model universe consisting of one system
and many environments: the first consisting of arbitrary states, and the second
consisting of ``singly-branching'' states consistent with a simple decoherence
model. Typical states from the random ensemble do not store information about
the system redundantly, but information stored in branching states has a
redundancy proportional to the environment's size. We compute the specific
redundancy for a wide range of model universes, and fit the results to a simple
first-principles theory. Our results show that the presence of redundancy
divides information about the system into three parts: classical (redundant);
purely quantum; and the borderline, undifferentiated or ``nonredundant,''
information.

functions is achieved by the transition from the original elementary

emerges during the perturbative construction of the metric $\Theta$ and, hence,
of the correct scalar product and of the physical norm. One finds that at the
higher energy levels the influence of all the non-Hermiticities of our model
becomes very strongly and progressively suppressed.

1984 (BB84), has been widely studied in the last years. This protocol uses four
states (more precisely, two complementary bases) for the encoding of the
classical bit. Recently, it has been noticed that by using the same four
states, but a different encoding of information, one can define a new protocol
which is more robust in practical implementations, specifically when attenuated
laser pulses are used instead of single-photon sources [V. Scarani et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 057901 (2004); referred to as SARG04]. We present a
detailed study of SARG04 in two different regimes. In the first part, we
consider an implementation with a single-photon source: we derive bounds on the
error rate $Q$ for security against all possible attacks by the eavesdropper.
The lower and the upper bound obtained for SARG04 ($Q\lesssim 10.95%$ and
$Q\gtrsim 14.9%$ respectively) are close to those obtained for BB84 ($Q\lesssim
12.4%$ and $Q\gtrsim 14.6%$ respectively). In the second part, we consider the
realistic source consisting of an attenuated laser and improve on previous
analysis by allowing Alice to optimize the mean number of photons as a function
of the distance. SARG04 is found to perform better than BB84, both in secret
key rate and in maximal achievable distance, for a wide class of Eve's attacks.

of pure as well as mixed quantum states of N-qubit systems. That same formalism
has important applications in the field of quantum error correcting codes,
where mixed stabiliser states correspond to projectors on subspaces associated
with stabiliser codes. Here, we derive efficient reduction procedures to obtain
various useful normal forms for stabiliser states. We explicitly prove that
these procedures will always converge to the correct result and that these
procedures are efficient in that they only require a polynomial number of
operations on the generators of the stabilisers.
  We obtain two single-party normal forms. The simplest, the row-reduced
echelon form, is useful to calculate partial traces of stabiliser states. The
second is the fully reduced form and allows for the efficient calculation of
the overlap between two stabiliser states, as well as of the Uhlmann fidelity
between them, and their Bures distance.
  We also find a reduction procedure of bipartite stabiliser states, where the
operations involved are restricted to be local ones. Using this two-party
normal form, we prove that every bipartite mixed stabiliser state is locally
equivalent to a direct product of a number of maximally entangled states and a
separable state. Using this normal form we can efficiently calculate every
reasonable bipartite entanglement measure of mixed stabiliser states.

mixed state is equal to the smaller of its two local entropies. Our protocol
gives rise to the asymptotically optimal EPR pair distillation procedure for a
given tripartite pure state, and we show that it actually yields EPR and GHZ
states; in fact, under a restricted class of protocols, which we call ""one-way
broadcasting"", the GHZ-rate is shown to be optimal.
  This result implies a capacity theorem for quantum channels where the
environment helps transmission by broadcasting the outcome of an optimally
chosen measurement. We discuss generalisations to m parties, and show (for m=4)
that the maximal amount of entanglement that can be localised between two
parties is given by the smallest entropy of a group of parties of which the one
party is a member, but not the other. This gives an explicit expression for the
asymptotic localisable entanglement, and shows that any nontrivial ground state
of a spin system can be used as a perfect quantum repeater if many copies are
available in parallel.
  Finally, we provide evidence that any unital channel is asymptotically
equivalent to a mixture of unitaries, and any general channel to a mixture of
partial isometries.
