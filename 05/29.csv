We found steep rise of
radiative torque efficiency as grain size increases. This allows larger grains
that are known to exist within molecular clouds to be aligned by the attenuated
and reddened interstellar radiation field. In particular, we found that, even
deep inside giant molecular clouds, e.g. at optical depths corresponding to
less than Av of 10 large grains can still be aligned by radiative torque. This
means that, contrary to earlier claims, far-infrared/submillimeter polarimetry
provides a reliable tool to study magnetic fields of pre-stellar cores. Our
results show that the grain size distribution is important for determining the
relation between the degree of polarization and intensity.

Channel Analysis for optically thin lines and its extension to the lines with

recover the scaling of the stochastic velocities from turbulent cascade, in
particular, Kolmogorov velocities give $K^{-2.7}$ contribution to the intensity
power spectrum. Synthetically increasing the channel thickness separates out
the underlying density inhomogeneities of the gas. Effects of self absorption,
on the other hand, retain the velocity signature even for integrated lines. As
a result, intensity fluctuations tend to show universal but featureless scaling
of the power $\propto K^{-3}$ over the range of scales.

ways to approach long standing problems. I briefly discuss a model of turbulent
reconnection within which the stochasticity of 3D magnetic field enables rapid
reconnection through both allowing multiple reconnection events to take place
simultaneously and by restricting the extension of current sheets. In fully
ionized gas the model in Lazarian and Vishniac 99 predicts reconnection rates
that depend only on the intensity of turbulence. In partially ionized gas a
modification of the original model in Lazarian, Vishniac and Cho 04 predicts
the reconnection rates that, apart from the turbulence intensity depend on the
degree of ionization. In both cases the reconnection may be slow and fast
depending on the level of turbulence in the system. As the result, the
reconnection gets bursty, which provides a possible explanation to Solar flares
and possibly to gamma ray busts. The implications of the turbulent reconnection
model have not been yet studied in sufficient detail. I discuss first order
Fermi acceleration of cosmic ray that takes place as the oppositely directed
magnetic fluxes move together. This acceleration would work in conjunction with
the second order Fermi acceleration that is caused by turbulence in the
reconnection region. In partially ionized gas the stochastic reconnection
enables fast removal of magnetic flux from star forming molecular clouds.

significance of not using the local Maxwellian approximation is further
demonstrated by exploring the dynamical evolution of compact super star

will result in underestimating the dynamical friction and overestimating
sinking time scale. Accordingly, it will lead to lower probability of forming
massive bulges and young nuclear star clusters in bulgeless galaxies.

isolated HI clouds like the VIRGOHI21, we numerically investigate physical
properties of tidal HI debris that were formed by galaxy-galaxy interaction in
clusters of galaxies. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal
debris with total HI masses of $10^8-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ can have (1) wide HI
velocity widths ($>200$ km s$^{-1}$), (2) a small mass fraction of stars

that the comparison between the simulated and the observed velocity fields of

(NDC) can be reached. The superconductor should be supercooled to T<T_c in the
normal phase under DC voltage. In such a nonequilibrium situation the NDC of
the superconductor is created by the excess conductivity of the fluctuation
Cooper pairs. We propose NDC of supercooled superconductors to be used as an
active medium for generation of electric oscillations. Such generators can be
used in the superconducting electronics as a new type THz source of radiation.
Oscillations can be modulated by the change of the bias voltage, electrostatic
doping by a gate electrode when the superconductor is the channel of a field
effect transistor, or by light. When small amplitude oscillations are
stabilized near the critical temperature T_c the generator can be used as a
bolometer. The essential for the applications NDC is predicted by the solution
of the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the metastable in the normal phase Cooper
pairs. Boltzmann equation for fluctuation Cooper pairs is a result of
state-of-the-art application of the microscopic theory of superconductivity.
Our theoretical conclusions are based on some approximations like time
dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, but nevertheless can reliably predict
appearance of NDC. The maximal frequency at which superconductors can operate
as generators is determined by the critical temperature \hbar omega_max ~ k_B
T_c. For high-T_c superconductors this maximal frequency falls well inside the
terahertz range. Technical conditions to avoid nucleation of the
superconducting phase are briefly discussed. We suggest that nanostructured
high-T_c superconductors patterned in a single chip can give the best technical

significantly the local symmetry. To evaluate the atomic scattering in this
case, we generalized the Hannon-Trammel formula and implemented it inside the
framework of atomic multiplet calculations in a crystal field. For an
illustration, we calculate the magnetic and orbital scattering in the CE phase
of \lsmo in the cases when the spins are aligned with the crystal lattice
vector ${\vec a}$ (or equivalently ${\vec b}$) and when they are rotated in the
$ab$-plane by 45$^{\circ}$ with respect to this axis. Magnetic spectra differ
for the two cases. For the orbital scattering, we show that for the former
configuration there is a non negligible $\sigma \to \sigma'$ ($\pi \to \pi'$)
scattering component, which vanishes in the 45$^\circ$ case, while the $\sigma
\to \pi'$ ($\pi \to \sigma'$) components are similar in the two cases. From the
consideration of two 90$^\circ$ spin canted structures, we conclude there is a
significant dependence of the orbital scattering spectra on the spin
arrangement. Recent experiments detected a sudden decrease of the orbital
scattering intensity upon increasing the temperature above the N\' eel
temperature in \lsmo. We discuss this behavior considering the effect of
different types of misorientations of the spins on the orbital scattering

constant curvature manifolds forms a novel deformation of the sl(2,R)
[semidirect product] R^2 Lie algebra. We present a simple calculus for
calculations in its universal enveloping algebra. As an application, we derive
generating functions for the actions and gauge invariances of massive,
partially massless and massless (for both bose and fermi statistics) higher
spins on constant curvature backgrounds. These are formulated in terms of a
minimal set of covariant, unconstrained, fields rather than towers of auxiliary
fields. Partially massless gauge transformations are shown to arise as
degeneracies of the flat, massless gauge transformation in one dimension
higher. Moreover, our results and calculus offer a considerable simplification
over existing techniques for handling higher spins. In particular, we show how
theories of arbitrary spin in dimension d can be rewritten in terms of a single
scalar field in dimension 2d where the d additional dimensions correspond to
coordinate differentials. We also develop an analogous framework for
spinor-tensor fields in terms of the corresponding superalgebra.

are essential to get de Sitter solutions in the type IIB string warped
compactification, by taking account of gravitational backreactions of anti-D
branes. In order to see the effects of the self-gravity of anti-D branes, a
simplified model is studied where a 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter ({\it AdS})
spacetime is realized by the bulk cosmological constant and the 5-form flux,
and anti-D branes are coupled to the 5-form field by Chern-Simon terms. The
{\it AdS} spacetime is truncated by introducing UV and IR cut-off branes like
the Randall-Sundrum model. We derive an effective theory for gravity on the UV
brane and reproduce the familiar result that the tensions of the anti-D branes
give potentials suppressed by the forth-power of the warp factor at the
location of the anti-D branes. However, in this simplified model, the potential
energy never inflates the UV brane, although the anti-D-branes are inflating.
The UV brane is dominated by dark radiation coming from the projection of the
5-dimensional Weyl tensor, unless the moduli fields for the anti-D branes are
stabilized. We comment on the possibility of avoiding this problem in a
realistic string theory compactification.

then CH(T) defines a polygon with N sides. The N-gon CH(T) is called a
\emph{wandering N-gon} if for every two non-negative integers i \neq j,
CH(f^i(T)) and CH(f^j(T)) are disjoint N-gons.
  A non-degenerate chord of S^1 is said to be \emph{critical} if its two
endpoints have the same image under f. Then for a critical chord, it is natural
to define its (forward) orbit by the forward iterates of the endpoints.
Similarly, call a critical chord \emph{recurrent} if one of its endpoints is
recurrent under f. The main result of our study is that a wandering N-gon has
at least N-1 recurrent critical chords in its limit set (defined in a natural
way) having pairwise disjoint, infinite orbits.
  Using this result, we are able to strengthen results of Blokh, Kiwi and Levin
about wandering polygons of laminations. We also discuss some applications to
the dynamics of polynomials. In particular, our study implies that if v is a
wandering non-precritical vertex of a locally connected polynomial Julia set,
then there exists at least ord(v)-1 recurrent critical points with pairwise
disjoint orbits, all having the same omega-limit set as v. Thus, we likewise
strengthen results about wandering vertices of polynomial Julia sets.

  This paper is about finding A,B,C,D such that $A^4+B^4=C^4+D^4$. In sect. 1,
Euler states his ""quartic conjecture"" that there do not exist any nontrivial
integer solutions to $A^4+B^4+C^4=D^4$. I do not know whether he stated this
conjecture previously.
  In sect. 3, Euler sets A=p+q, B=p-q, C=r+s,D=r-s. Taking r=p and s=q gives
the trivial solution of C=A and B=D, but this gives Euler the idea of making p
and r multiples of each other and q and s multiples of each other. If k=ab this
again gives the obvious solution, so in sect. 5: Perturb k to be $k=ab(1+z)$.
  Euler works out two solutions. One is A=2219449, B=-555617, C=1584749,
D=2061283.
  Hardy and Wright, fifth ed., p. 201 give a simpler parametric solution of
$A^4+B^4=C^4+D^4$. Thomas Heath in his Diophantus, second ed., pp. 377-380
gives a faithful explanation of Euler's solution.

basic, most powerful subset of directions of tangents having a sharp corner

necessary to point out that the form of the curves of quartzes frequencies
