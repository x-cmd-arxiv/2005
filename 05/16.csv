constraints about the cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and the delay time
of type Ia supernovae from star formation (tau_{Ia}), based only on supernova
data. Here we parameterize the CSFH by two parameters, alpha and beta that are
the evolutionary indices (proportional to (1+z)^{alpha, beta}) at z <~ 1 and >~
1, respectively, and quantitatively examined how well the three parameters
(alpha, beta, and tau_{Ia}) can be constrained in ongoing and future supernova
surveys. We found that the type classification of detected supernovae down to
the magnitude of I_{AB} ~ 27 is essential, to get useful constraint on beta.
The parameter tau_{Ia} can also be constrained within an accuracy of ~ 1--2
Gyr, without knowing alpha that is somewhat degenerate with tau_{Ia}. This
might be potentially achieved by ground-based surveys but depending on the
still highly uncertain type-classification by imaging data. More reliable
classification will be achieved by the SNAP mission. The supernova counts at a
magnitude level of I_{AB} or K_{AB} ~ 30 will allow us to break degeneracies
between alpha and tau_{Ia} and independently constrain all the three
parameters, even without knowing supernova types. This can be achieved by the
SNAP and JWST missions, having different strength of larger statistics and
reach to higher redshifts, respectively. The dependence of observable
quantities on survey time intervals is also quantitatively calculated and
discussed.

timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed,
while a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind

considerable amount of structural defects due to their low temperature

should lengthen the EMFP. This is based on the previous experiments in which
annealing eliminated structural defects in various carbon materials including

^{s}$ and the anisotropy of the orbital susceptibility $\chi ^{orb}$ allow us
to conclude that charge disproportionation occurs, in a non magnetic Co$^{3+}$
and two magnetic sites with about 0.3 and 0.7 holes in the $t_{2g}$ multiplet.
The data are consistent with those for the single Co site in the anhydrous and
HSC phase assuming the expected Co$^{3.65+}$ charge.

gravitational waveforms for these sources can be computed using for the
radiation reaction force the gradient of one half the difference between the
retarded and advanced metric perturbations. Using post-Newtonian expansions, we
argue that the resulting waveforms should be sufficiently accurate for signal
detection with LISA. Data-analysis templates will require higher accuracy,
going beyond adiabaticity; this remains a significant challenge. We describe an
explicit computational procedure for obtaining waveforms based on Mino's
result, for the case of a point particle coupled to a scalar field. We derive
an expression for the time-averaged time derivative of the Carter constant, and
verify that the expression correctly predicts that circular orbits remain
circular while evolving via radiation reaction. The derivation uses detailed
properties of mode expansions, Green's functions and bound geodesic orbits in
the Kerr spacetime, which we review in detail. This paper is about three
quarters review and one quarter new material. The intent is to give a complete

appears to only exist for bodies whose mass is less than that of: planets,
moons, comets, and heavy asteroids of known mass. Assuming the observational
evidence is reliable, and not the result of an unknown systematic effect, a
violation of the Weak Principle of Equivalence is implied. To propose an
additional force fails to satisfy this constraint. This paper presents a new
hypothesis involving additional field energy in the form of: a finite number of
lunar sourced constant amplitude (Lorentz invariant) wave-like undulations upon
the gravitational field. Although apparently a futile suggestion, the author's
model overcomes concerns regarding wave dissipation, wave generation, and the
apparent constancy of the anomaly. A shortfall in motion arises because a tiny
proportion of spacecraft kinetic energy is directed into a superposition of
non-translational longitudinal oscillatory components. The restriction of this
effect to low mass bodies is also addressed. Additionally, the annual residual
of the Pioneer anomaly may be attributed to a real 356 day Callisto-Titan wave
resonance. This hypothesis may also be readily applied to other solar system
anomalies including: the Earth flyby anomaly, an apparent absence of small
comets, an apparent paucity of smaller bodies in the Main Belt of asteroids,
and residual doubts concerning the migrating planets hypothesis that addresses
the too rapid formation of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

computing the entropy of these black holes in a theory where we modify the

computed this way is finite and has the right dependence on the charges in
accordance with the general scaling argument, but the overall numerical factor
does not agree with that computed from the statistical entropy except for D=4

higher derivative corrections are capable of stretching the horizon of a small

sigma model of a toric variety in the infinite volume limit (the A-model). The
second theory is an intermediate model, which we call the I-model. The
equivalence between the A-model and the I-model is achieved by realizing the
former as a deformation of a linear sigma model with a complex torus as the
target and then applying to it a version of the T-duality. On the other hand,
the I-model is closely related to the twisted Landau-Ginzburg model (the
B-model) that is mirror dual to the A-model. Thus, the mirror symmetry is
realized in two steps, via the I-model. In particular, we obtain a natural
interpretation of the superpotential of the Landau-Ginzburg model as the sum of
terms corresponding to the components of a divisor in the toric variety. We
also relate the cohomology of the supercharges of the I-model to the chiral de
Rham complex and the quantum cohomology of the underlying toric variety.

solution is CP^(N_f-1) for the gauge theory at finite gauge couplings.
Therefore the moduli space at finite gauge couplings is topologically the same
manifold as that at infinite gauge coupling, where the gauged linear sigma
model reduces to a nonlinear sigma model. The proof is extended to the U(Nc)
gauge theory with Nf hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation,
provided the moduli matrix of the domain wall solution is U(1)-factorizable.
Thus the dimension of the moduli space of U(Nc) gauge theory is bounded from
below by the dimension of the U(1)-factorizable part of the moduli space. We
also obtain sharp estimates of the asymptotic exponential decay which depend on

different from this micro-factory. In this article, I begin with Alice's guided
tour of this micro-factory in her dream during which the guide shows her wide
varieties of the nano-machines in this factory. The style of presentation of
the first half of this article is inspired by Lewis Carrol's {\it Alice in
Wonderland}. In the second half, I introduce the methods of studying the
materials and mechanisms of the molecular machines through dialogues; the three
participants in this discussion are Alice, her elder brother Alex and her
father Albert. The style of presentation of the second half of this article, in
terms of a dialogue, is adapted from Galileo's {\it Dialogue Concerning the Two
Chief World Systems}. Albert, a professor of biophysics, emphasizes the crucial
differences between the mechanisms of the natural nano-machines and those of
their macroscopic counterparts. He also points out some practical applications
of this interdisciplinary research in biomedical science and nano-technology.

computer science, statistics, and their applications to biological data
analysis. We present a new method for the discretization of real-valued data
into a finite number of discrete values. Novel aspects of the method are the
incorporation of an information-theoretic criterion and a criterion to
determine the optimal number of values. While the method can be used for data
clustering, the motivation for its development is the need for a discretization
algorithm for several multivariate time series of heterogeneous data, such as
transcript, protein, and metabolite concentration measurements. As several
modeling methods for biochemical networks employ discrete variable states, the
method needs to preserve correlations between variables as well as the dynamic
features of the time series. A C++ implementation of the algorithm is available
from the authors at http://polymath.vbi.vt.edu/discretization .

sequence--independent threshold energy.

  Here we show that this entanglement is physical demonstrating the principles
of its extraction from a typical solid state system by scattering two particles
off the system. Moreover we show how to simulate this process using present-day
optical lattices technology. This demonstrates not only that entanglement
exists in solids but also that it can be used for quantum information
processing or for test of Bell's inequalities.

contrasts with the case of pure light-matter states in which the rate of change
of the two entropies are positively correlated and in fact identical. We give
an analytical derivation of the anti-correlation phenomenon and discuss the
