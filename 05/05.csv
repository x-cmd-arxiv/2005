to determine the surface brightness profile of M31 along the south-east minor
axis. We combine surface photometry and faint red giant branch star counts to
trace the profile from the innermost regions out to a projected radius of 4
degrees (~55 kpc) where the V-band surface brightness is 32 mag per square
arcsec; this is the first time the M31 minor axis profile has been mapped over
such a large radial distance using a single dataset. We confirm the finding by
Pritchet & van den Bergh (1994) that the minor axis profile can be described by
a single de Vaucouleurs law out to a projected radius of 1.4 degrees or ~20
kpc. Beyond this, the surface brightness profile flattens considerably and is
consistent with either a power-law of index -2.3 or an exponential of
scalelength 14 kpc. The fraction of the total M31 luminosity contained in this
component is ~2.5%. While it is tempting to associate this outer component with
a true Population II halo in M31, we find that the mean colour of the stellar
population remains approximately constant at V-i~1.6 from 0.5-3.5 degrees along
the minor axis. This result suggests that the same metal-rich stellar
population dominates both structural components.

is fairly smooth in the range 0.0 <= Q_b < 0.8. Our analysis also provides a

the disk is very twisted (highly warped) at radii greater than 200 AU where the

disk initially misaligned with a planetary system, becomes warped due to
precession induced by planetesimal bodies and planets. However, the twistedness
of HD100546's disk cannot be explained by precession during the lifetime of the
system induced by a single Jovian mass planet within the clearing at ~13 AU.
One possible explanation for the corrugated disk is that precession was induced
by massive of bodies embedded in the disk at larger radius. This would require
approximately a Jupiter mass of bodies well outside the central clearing at 13

for short gamma-ray bursts. They have also been studied for their potential as

that, consistent with recent numerical simulations, it is expected that mergers
between neutron stars and black holes will be prompt, with no accretion disk
and no stable mass transfer, if the black hole has a mass greater than that of
the neutron star and is spinning slowly. The reason is that for comparable
masses, angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation starts a plunge orbit
well outside the innermost stable circular orbit, causing direct merging rather
than extended mass transfer. Even when the black hole is spinning rapidly and
exactly prograde with respect to the orbit, we show that it is possible within

spherically symmetric perturbations in the framework of Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND). The code evolves spherical gaseous shells in an expanding
Universe by employing a MOND-type relationship between the fluctuations in the
density field and the gravitational force, $g$. We focus on the evolution of
initial density perturbations of the form $\delta_{i}\sim r_{i}^{-s}$ for
$0<s<3$. A shell is initially cold and remains so until it encounters the shock
formed by the earlier collapse of shells nearer to the centre. During the early
epochs $g$ is sufficiently large and shells move according to Newtonian
gravity. As the physical size of the perturbation increases with time, $g$ gets
smaller and the evolution eventually becomes MOND dominated. However, the
density in the inner collapsed regions is large enough that they re-enter the
Newtonian regime. The evolved gas temperature and density profiles tend to a
universal form that is independent of the the slope, $s$, and of the initial
amplitude. An analytic explanation of this intriguing result is offered. Over a
wide range of scales, the temperature, density and entropy profiles in the
simulations, depend on radius roughly like $r^{0.5}$, $r^{-1.5}$ and $r^{1.5}$,
respectively. We compare our results with XMM-{\it Newton} and {\it Chandra}
observations of clusters. The temperature profiles of 16 observed clusters are
either flat or show a mild decrease at $R\gtsim 200\rm kpc$. MOND profiles show
a significant increase that cannot reconciled with the data. Our simulated MOND
clusters are substantially denser than the observed clusters. It remains to be

stars, which enables them to interact strongly with their surrounding ISM, thus
creating bow shocks. These offer us an ideal opportunity to learn more about
the ISM. They were first detected and analysed around runaway OB-stars using
the IRAS allsky survey by van Buren et al. (1995). Using the geometry of such
bow shocks information concerning the ISM density and its fluctuations can be
gained from such infrared observations. As to help to improve the bow shock
models, additional observations at other wavelengths, e.g. H-Alpha, are most
welcome. However due to their low velocity these bow shocks have a size of ~1
degrees, and could only be observed as a whole with great difficulties. In the
light of the new H-Alpha allsky surveys (SHASSA/VTSS) this is no problem any
more. We developed different methods to detect bow shocks, e.g. the improved
determination of their symmetry axis with radial distance profiles. Using two
H-Alpha-allsky surveys (SHASSA/VTSS), we searched for bow shocks and compared
the different methods. From our sample we conclude, that the correlation
between the direction of both proper motion and the symmetry axis determined
with radial distance profile is the most promising detection method. We found
eight bow shocks around HD 17505, HD 24430, HD 48099, HD 57061, HD 92206, HD
135240, HD 149757, and HD 158186 from 37 candidates taken from van Buren et al.
(1995). Additionally to the traditional determination of ISM parameters using
the standoff distance of the bow shock, another approach was chosen, using the
thickness of the bow-shock layer. Both methods lead to the same results,
yielding densities (~1 cm^{-3}) and the maximal temperatures (~10^4 K), that
fit well to the up-to-date picture of the Warm Ionised Medium.

high closure fields with high values of the differential susceptibility. Low
magnetisation as compared to bulk, shifted loops after field-cooling, highfield
irreversibilities between zero-field and field cooling processes and ageing
phenomena in the time-dependence of the magnetisation, are also observed. This
phenomenology indicates the existence of some kind of freezing phenomenon
arising from a complex hierarchy of the energy levels, whose origin is
currently under discussion. Two models have been proposed to account for it: i)
the existence of a spin-glass state at the surface of the particle which is
coupled to the particle core through an exchange field; and ii) the collective
behaviour induced by interparticle interactions. In real systems, both
contributions simultaneously occur, being difficult to distinguish their
effects. In contrast, numerical simulations allow us to build a model just

  Kolesnichenko",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  The coherent mixing of the current states in the superconducting weak link
subject to a Josephson phase difference $\phi$ and subject to an external
transport current in the banks is one of the aims of this work. At $\phi=\pi $
the nonlocal mixing of current states produces two vortices close to the
point-contact between superconducting bulks. The effect of point-contact
reflection in an impenetrable interface and effect of temperature on the
vortices have been studied. It is obtained that increasing the reflection of
the point-contact destroys the vortices while increasing the temperature
restore these vortices. The vortex state is a new version of the interference
between the macroscopic states and quantum tunnelling. Also, the weak link
between unitary triplet superconductors which have $f-$wave and $p+h-$wave
pairing symmetry has been studied from the spin and charge current-phase
relation point of view. The main result in the second part of this thesis, is
the polarization of the spin transport when a junction between triplet
superconductors is used. It is observed that the spin current is the result of
the misorientation between the gap vectors of two supercondcutors. In addition,
the weak link between two bipolar non-unitary triplet superconductors is
studied mathematically. The current-phase relations obtained in third part of
this thesis are totally different from the junctions between the unitary
spin-triplet superconductors and between the spin-singlet superconductors. The
current phase diagrams which have been obtained in this work can be used to
distinguish the symmetry of the order parameter in the crystals.

differ, to a certain extent, from the encryption key, we show, nevertheless,
that the best strategy is to strive for perfect match between the two keys, by
applying reliable channel coding to the key bits, and to control the distortion
solely via rate-distortion coding of the plaintext source before the
encryption. In this sense, our result has a flavor similar to that of the

the quark mass in B -> X_s gamma. We present strange quark mass corrections to

existing subleading contributions from the B meson shape functions to obtain
complete subleading corrections.

finite-temperature properties of the (2+1)d Georgi-Glashow model is explored.
At zero temperature, these fields are W-bosons, which play the role of heavy
nodes, through which the quark-antiquark string passes. This fact is shown to
increase by a factor $4\sqrt{2}$ the absolute value of the coefficient at the
1/R-term in the large-distance potential with respect to that of the Nambu-Goto
string in 3d. The string tension also acquires a positive correction, which is,
however, exponentially small. At finite temperature, the matter fields of
interest are massless fundamental quarks, which diminish the deconfinement
critical temperature by way of an additional attraction of a monopole and an
antimonopole inside their molecules through the quark zero modes. It is
demonstrated that, outside the BPS-limit, when the number of massless flavors
is 4 or larger, the deconfinement phase transition occurs already at the
temperatures of the order of the temperature of dimensional reduction. In the
BPS limit, this critical number of flavors is 3. Since the temperature of
dimensional reduction is exponenetially small and since monopoles are
instantons in (2+1)d, these numbers can be compared with the one in the
instanton-liquid model of 4d QCD, at which the chiral phase transition occurs
at a vanishingly small temperature. The latter number is known to be of the
order of 5, so that the results of the two models are quite close to each
other.

the localized soliton smears over all of noncommutative space. In addition, we
evaluate distributions of D-brane charge, F-string charge, and energy density

`toughie' in ""Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection,"" by Peter
Winkler. To paraphrase Winkler's book, there is a banquet dinner to be served
at a mathematics conference. At a particular table, $n$ men are to be seated
around a circular table. There are $n$ napkins, exactly one between each of the
place settings. Being doubly cursed as both men and mathematicians, they are
all assumed to be ignorant of table etiquette. The men come to sit at the table
one at a time and in random order. When a guest sits down, he will prefer the
left napkin with probability $p$ and the right napkin with probability $q=1-p$.
If there are napkins on both sides of the place setting, he will choose the
napkin he prefers. If he finds only one napkin available, he will take that
napkin (though it may not be the napkin he wants). The third possibility is
that no napkin is available, and the unfortunate guest is faced with the
prospect of going through dinner without any napkin!
  We think of the question of how many people don't get napkins as a statistic
for signed permutations, where the permutation gives the order in which people
sit and the sign tells us whether they initially reach left or right. We also
keep track of the number of guests who get a napkin, but not the napkin they
prefer. We build a generating function for the joint distribution of these
statistics, and use it to answer questions like: What is the probability that
every guest receives a napkin? How many guests do we expect to be without a
napkin? How many guests are happy with the napkin they receive?

Zeno in this paper. Instead we review some unexpected encounters of Zeno with
modern science. The paper begins with a brief biography of Zeno of Elea
followed by his famous paradoxes of motion. Reflections on continuity of space
and time lead us to Banach and Tarski and to their celebrated paradox, which is
in fact not a paradox at all but a strict mathematical theorem, although very
counterintuitive. Quantum mechanics brings another flavour in Zeno paradoxes.
Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are really paradoxical but now experimental
facts. Then we discuss supertasks and bifurcated supertasks. The concept of
localization leads us to Newton and Wigner and to interesting phenomenon of
quantum revivals. At last we note that the paradoxical idea of timeless
universe, defended by Zeno and Parmenides at ancient times, is still alive in
quantum gravity. The list of references that follows is necessarily incomplete
but we hope it will assist interested reader to fill in details.

network of the nematode \textit{Caenorhapditis elegans} (\textit{C. elegans}),
we build the neuronal map of \textit{C. elegans} based on geometrical positions
of neurons and define the cost as inter-neuronal Euclidean distance \textit{d}.
We show that the wiring probability decays exponentially as a function of
\textit{d}. Using the edge exchanging method and the component placement
optimization scheme, we show that positions of neurons are not randomly
distributed but organized to reduce the total wiring cost. Furthermore, we
numerically study the trade-off between the wiring cost and the performance of
the Hopfield model on the neural network.

  reinforcements","10 pages, 6 figures, to be published in Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.72.011907",,"q-bio.NC",,"  In this work we analyze the solutions of a simple system of coupled phase
oscillators in which the connectivity is learned dynamically. The model is
inspired in the process of learning of birdsong by oscine birds. An oscillator
acts as the generator of a basic rhythm, and drives slave oscillators which are
responsible for different motor actions. The driving signal arrives to each
driven oscillator through two different pathways. One of them is a ""direct""
pathway. The other one is a ""reinforcement"" pathway, through which the signal
arrives delayed. The coupling coefficients between the driving oscillator and
the slave ones evolve in time following a Hebbian-like rule. We discuss the
conditions under which a driven oscillator is capable of learning to lock to
the driver. The resulting phase difference and connectivity is a function of
the delay of the reinforcement. Around some specific delays, the system is
capable to generate dramatic changes in the phase difference between the driver
and the driven systems. We discuss the dynamical mechanism responsible for this
effect, and possible applications of this learning scheme.

inhomogeneous systems of ODEs. In contrast to the usual Hamiltonian mechanics,
our approach is based on the use of non-stationary Poisson brackets, i.e.
corresponding Poisson tensor is allowed to explicitly depend on time. Starting
from this pseudo-Hamiltonian formulation we develop a consistent deformation
quantization procedure involving a non-stationary star-product $*_t$ and an
``extended'' operator of time derivative $D_t=\partial_t+...$, differentiating
the $\ast_t$-product. As in the usual case, the $\ast_t$-algebra of physical
observables is shown to admit an essentially unique (time dependent) trace
functional $\mathrm{Tr}_t$. Using these ingredients we construct a complete and
fully consistent quantum-mechanical description for any linear dynamical system
with or without dissipation. The general quantization method is exemplified by
the models of damped oscillator and radiating point charge.

each graph. From this orthogonal matrix, we derive two further matrices. The
spectrum of each of these three matrices is considered as a graph invariant.
For the first two cases, we compute the spectrum explicitly and show that it is
determined by the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the original graph. We
then show by computation that the isomorphism classes of many known families of
strongly regular graphs (up to 64 vertices) are characterized by the spectrum
of this matrix. We conjecture that this is always the case for strongly regular
graphs and we show that the conjecture is not valid for general graphs. We
verify that the smallest regular graphs which are not distinguished with our
method are on 14 vertices.
