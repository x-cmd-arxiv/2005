1.9 Gyr, based on HST ACS observations carried out as part of the GEMS survey.
This study is amongst the first to probe the evolution of dwarfs over such a
large timescale. The comparison of structural properties, particularly size and
scale length, indicates that the dwarfs in the redshift range z ~ 0.01 to 0.15
(look-back times up to 1.9 Gyr) are more extended than local dwarfs. We argue
that this difference is due to the star formation activity becoming more
centrally concentrated in late-type dwarfs over the last ~ 1.9 Gyr. We discuss
several possible causes for this evolution. We also find a lack of blue compact
dwarfs in the GEMS sample and interpret this as indicative of the fact that
strong, centrally concentrated star formation is a feature of evolved dwarfs
that are entering their final stages of evolution.

data in the literature, this database provides a valuable resource for
searching for short timescale variability - both periodic and aperiodic - as
well as for studying the secular evolution of these systems. In the case of
V1057 Cyg (which is the system exhibiting the largest changes in brightness
since it went into outburst) we compare the photometric data with time
dependent models. We show that prior to the end of the `plateau' stage in 1996,
the evolution of V1057 Cyg in the $V-(B-V)$ colour-magnitude diagram is well
represented by disc instability models in which the outburst is triggered by
some agent - such as an orbiting planet - in the inner disc. Following the end
of the plateau phase in 1996, the dimming and irregular variations are
consistent with occultation of the source by a variable dust screen, which has
previously been interpreted in terms of dust condensation events in the
observed disc wind. Here we instead suggest that this effect results from the
interaction between the wind and an infalling dusty envelope, the existence of
this envelope having been previously invoked in order to explain the mid
infrared emissio of FU Orionis systems. We discuss how this model may explain
some of the photometric and spectroscopic characteristics of FU Orionis systems

spectrum in the cool core of the Hydra A galaxy cluster can be understood by
kinetic energy injection by active galaxies that drives a turbulent non-helical
magnetic dynamo into its saturated state. Although dramatic differences exist
between small-scale dynamo scenarios, their saturated state is expected to be
similar, as we show for three scenarios: the flux rope dynamo, the fluctuation
dynamo, and the explosive dynamo. Based on those scenarios, we develop an
analytical model of the hydrodynamic and magnetic turbulence in cool cores. The
model implies magnetic field strengths that fit well with Faraday rotation
measurements and minimum energy estimates for the sample of cool core clusters
having such data available. Predictions for magnetic fields in clusters for
which the appropriate observational information is still missing, and for yet
unobserved quantities like the hydrodynamical turbulence velocity and
characteristic length-scale are provided. The underlying dynamo models suggest
magnetic intermittency and possibly a large-scale hydrodynamic viscosity. We
conclude that the success of the model to explain the field strength in cool
core clusters indicates that in general cluster magnetic fields directly
reflect hydrodynamical turbulence, also in clusters without cool cores.

relativistic jets from H 1743-322 with the interstellar medium causing in-situ

present either in visible stars or the hot gas. We discuss here the possibility
that some of the iron expelled into the hot gas by Type Ia supernovae may have
radiatively cooled, avoiding detection by X-ray and optical observers.
Hydrodynamic models of Type Ia explosions in the hot gas inside elliptical
galaxies result in a gas of nearly pure iron that is several times hotter than
the local interstellar gas. We describe the subsequent thermal evolution of the
iron-rich gas as it radiates and thermally mixes with the surrounding gas.
There is a critical time by which the iron ions must mix into the ambient gas
to avoid rapid radiative cooling. We find that successful mixing is possible if
the iron ions diffuse with large mean free paths, as in an unmagnetized plasma.
However, in microgauss fields the Larmor radii of the iron ions are
exceptionally small, so the field geometry must be highly tangled or radial to
allow the iron to mix by diffusion faster than it cools by radiative losses.
The possibility that some of the supernova iron cools cannot be easily
discounted.

We examined stellar populations of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
through comparisons of their optical and near-IR photometry data with template
spectra generated by a population synthesis code. The ages from the onset of
star formation for these star-forming galaxies with I<=25.0 are typically
50-200 Myr, and their stellar masses are between (0.5-5) x 10^10 M_sun,
consistent with previous studies. We also compared these SED fitting results
with those for distant red galaxies (DRGs) at z>2 discovered by FIRES. DRGs
have larger stellar masses, larger dust attenuation than our UV-luminous LBG
sample, and their star formation rates are often comparable to LBGs. These
trends suggest that majority of DRGs are indeed the most massive systems at the
redshift and are still in the active star-forming phase. Unless the number
density of DRGs is much smaller than LBGs, estimates based on UV selected

period evolution during the recent outburst. We measured a very rapid spin-up
episode, lasting 130days, which decreased the pulse period by 1.8s. The spin-up
rate, pdot=-1.5e-7 s/s, is the largest ever measured for SAXJ2103.5+4545, and
it is among the fastest for an accreting pulsar. The pulse profile shows
evidence for temporal variability, apparently not related to the source flux or
to the orbital phase. The X-ray spectrum is hard and there is significant
emission up to 150keV. A new derivation of the orbital period, based on RXTE
data, is also reported.

energetically important. We show that these may provide sufficient cooling to
tap most of the explosion energy. However, at the extreme energies usually
invoked for gamma-ray bursts, the neutrino opacity suffices to prevent dramatic
losses, provided that the heating process is sufficiently fast. In a generic
case, a few tens of percent of the initial fireball energy will escape as an
isotropic millisecond burst of thermal neutrinos with a temperature of about 60
MeV, which is detectable for nearby gamma-ray bursts and hypernovae. For
parameters we find most likely for gamma-ray burst fireballs, the dominant
processes are purely leptonic, and thus the baryon loading of the fireball does

with the ""first break"" ($t\sim 0.5$ day after the GRB) of the OT light curve.
The beginning of spectral changes are seen as early as $\sim 10-12$ hours after
the GRB. So, the onset of the spectral changes for $t<1$ day indicates that the
contribution from Type Ic supernova (SN) into the OT optical flux can be
detected earlier. The properties of early spectra of GRB 030329/SN 2003dh can
be consistent with a shock moving into a stellar wind formed from the pre-SN.
Such a behavior (similar to that near the UV shock breakout in SNe) can be
explained by the existence of a dense matter in the immediate surroundings of
massive stellar GRB/SN progenitor). The urgency is emphasized of observation of
early GRB/SN spectra for solving a question that is essential for understanding
GRB physical mechanism: {\it Do all} long-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused
by (or physically connected to) {\it ordinary} core-collapse supernovae? If
clear association of normal/ordinary core-collapse SNe (SN Ib/c, and others SN

which the core component appears unresolved (generally smaller than 0.05 mas)
in one direction, usually transverse to the direction into which the jet

galaxies are on average less compact. Also, in an active galaxy the
sub-milliarcsecond core component tends to be less dominant. IDV sources
typically have a more compact, more core-dominated structure on
sub-milliarcsecond scales than non-IDV sources, and sources with a greater

density. The objects known to be GeV gamma-ray loud appear to have a more

combined ROSAT, Chandra, XMM-Newton data (6 epochs) give, contrary to earlier
findings, no clear indication of a spin evolution of the neutron star. The
X-ray light curves are double-humped with pronounced hardness ratio variations
suggesting an inhomogeneous surface temperature with two spots separated by
about ~160 degr. The sharpness of the two humps suggests a mildly relativistic
star with a ratio between R_ns, the neutron star radius at source, and r_S, the
Schwarzschild-radius, of R_ns/r_S > 3.5. Assuming Planckian energy
distributions as local radiation sources, light curves were synthesized which
were found to be in overall qualitative agreement with observed light curves in
two different energy bands. The temperature distribution used was based on the
crustal field models by Geppert et al. (2004) for a central temperature of T_c
= 10^8 K and an external dipolar field of B ~ 10^{13} G. This gives a mean
atmospheric temperature of 55 eV. A much simpler model with two homogeneous
spots with T_\infty = 92 eV, and 84 eV, and a cold rest star, T_star,\infty <
45 eV, invisible at X-ray wavelengths, was found to be similarly successful.
The new temperature determination and the new dot(P)_{spin} suggest that the

complicate the implementation of a Hamiltonian framework: (i) The action

space variable and the introduction of its conjugate momentum. The canonical
Hamiltonian is constructed on this phase space. (ii) The action possesses a
local symmetry -- reparametrization invariance. The two labels we use to
parametrize points on the surface are themselves physically irrelevant. This
symmetry implies primary constraints, one for each label, that need to be

tangential to the surface. The conservation of the primary constraints imply
two secondary constraints, fixing the tangential components of the momentum

law distribution of magnitudes m' of daughters of first-generation of a mother
of magnitude m has two branches m'<m with exponent beta-d and m'>m with
exponent beta+d, where beta and d are two positive parameters. We predict that

h by the hierarchy of successive generations of triggered events. The empirical
absence of such two-branched distributions implies, if this model is seriously
considered, that the earth is close to criticality (s close to 1) so that beta
- h \approx \beta + h \approx \beta. We also find that, for a significant part

relation between crystal-crystal transformations and pressure-induced
amorphization. On increasing pressure at very low temperature, our model
undergoes a martensitic crystal-crystal transformation. The characteristics of
the resulting polycrystalline structure depend on defect density, compression
rate, and nucleation and growth barriers. We find two different limiting cases.
In one of them the martensite crystals, once nucleated, grow easily
perpendicularly to the invariant interface, and the final structure contains
large crystals of the different martensite variants. Upon decompression almost
every atom returns to its original position, and the original crystal is fully
recovered. In the second limiting case, after nucleation the growth of
martensite crystals is inhibited by energetic barriers. The final morphology in
this case is that of a polycrystal with a very small crystal size. This may be
taken to be amorphous if we have only access (as experimentally may be the
case) to the angularly averaged structure factor. However, this `X-ray
amorphous' material is anisotropic, and this shows up upon decompression, when
it recovers the original crystalline structure with an orientation correlated
with the one it had prior to compression. The memory effect of this X-ray
amorphous material is a natural consequence of the memory effect associated to
the underlying martensitic transformation. We suggest that this kind of
mechanism is present in many of the experimental observations of the memory
glass effect, in which a crystal with the original orientation is recovered
from an apparently amorphous sample when pressure is released.

gravitational action is written in arbitrary dimensions and allowed to depend
nonlinearly on the curvature scalar and its couplings with a scalar field. Also
the case of a function of the curvature scalar multiplying a matter Lagrangian
is considered. The proof is given both in the metric and in the first-order
formalism, i.e. under the Palatini variational principle. It is found that the
covariant conservation of energy-momentum is built-in to the field equations.
This crucial result, called the generalized Bianchi identity, can also be
deduced directly from the covariance of the extended gravitational action.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that in all of these cases, the freely falling
world lines are determined by the field equations alone and turn out to be the
geodesics associated with the metric compatible connection. The independent
connection in the Palatini formulation of these generalized theories does not
have a similar direct physical interpretation. However, in the conformal
Einstein frame a certain bi-metricity emerges into the structure of these
theories. In the light of our interpretation of the independent connection as

There are similarities and differences between plasma instabilities in abelian

whether non-abelian self-interactions are the limiting factor in the growth of
non-abelian plasma instabilities. We study this problem with 3+1 dimensional
numerical simulations. We find that non-abelian plasma instabilities behave
very differently from abelian ones once they grow to be non-perturbatively
large, in contrast with earlier results of 1+1 dimensional simulations. In

in the \chiCQM with configuration mixing. Using \Delta u, \Delta_3, \bar u-\bar

following sets of parameters: a=0.1, \alpha=0.4, \beta=0.7, |\zeta|=0.65 (Case
I); a=0.1, \alpha=0.4, \beta=0.6, |\zeta|=0.70 (Case II); a=0.14, \alpha=0.4,

accordance with earlier calculations, whereas other parameters are treated free
and the Case IV represents our best fit. The fits clearly establish that a
small non-zero value of the coupling of \eta' is preferred over the higher
values of \eta' as well as when \zeta=0, the latter implying the absence of
\eta' from the dynamics of \chiCQM. Our best fit achieves an overall excellent

exponentially rising density of states, or equivalently with the existence of a
thermal string winding mode which becomes tachyonic above a specific
temperature. However, the details of the Hagedorn transition turn out to depend
critically on the precise manner in which a zero-temperature string theory is
extrapolated to finite temperature. In this paper, we argue that for broad
classes of closed string theories, the traditional Hagedorn transition is
completely absent when the correct extrapolation is used. However, we also
argue that there is an alternative ``re-identified'' Hagedorn transition which
is triggered by the thermal winding excitations of a different, ``effective''
tachyonic string ground state. These arguments allow us to re-identify the
Hagedorn temperature for heterotic strings. Moreover, we find that all
tachyon-free closed string models in ten dimensions share the same (revised)
Hagedorn temperature, resulting in a universal Hagedorn temperature for both
Type II and heterotic strings. We also comment on the possibility of thermal

a space of constant dimension. We also show many structural results as a

long optical fibers, taking into account the Kerr and nonlocal nonlinearities
on an equal footing. We use the Wigner approach on the modified nonlinear
Schroedinger equation to obtain a wave kinetic equation and a nonlinear
dispersion relation. The latter exhibit that the optical pulse decoherence
reduces the growth rate of the modulational instability, and thereby contribute
to the nonlinear stability of the pulses in long optical fibers. It is also
found that the interaction between spectral broadening and nonlocality tends to
extend the instability region.

Schatz (ZJS). The first statement is about the use of quasistatic approximation

the possibility of exact cancellation of radiative relaxation in periodical
chains of nanoparticles. The relationship between the quasistatic
approximation, the dipole approximation, and the approximation due to Doyle

that the exact cancellation of radiative relaxation cannot take place in the

to model them we assume that each membrane-associated MinD protein can form up

induced hydrolysis strongly depends on the number of bonds MinD has
established.

measuring absolute rotation is enhanced via use of the anomalous dispersion

the inverse of the group index, saturating to a bound determined by the group
velocity dispersion. We also show how the offsetting effect of the concomitant
broadening of the resonator linewidth may be circumvented by using an active
cavity. For realistic conditions, the enhancement factor is as high as 106. We
also show how normal dispersion used for slow light can enhance relative
rotation sensing in a specially designed Sagnac interferometer, with the
enhancement given by the slowing factor

of coherent states. Using simulations of quantum trajectories and
visualizations of corresponding measurement operators, I show that the proposed
measurement scheme adapts itself to the features of each ensemble. For all
considered ensembles of coherent states, it consistently outperforms heterodyne
