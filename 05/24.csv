effects of current helicity fluxes and boundaries are included within the
framework of the dynamical quenching model. In contrast to the case with
periodic boundary conditions, the final saturation energy of the mean field
decreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. If a
nondimensional scaling factor in the current helicity flux exceeds a certain
critical value, the dynamo can operate even without kinetic helicity, i.e. it
is based only on shear and current helicity fluxes, as first suggested by
Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752). Only above this threshold is the current
helicity flux also able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. The fact that
certain turbulence simulations have now shown apparently non-resistively
limited mean field saturation amplitudes may be suggestive of the current
helicity flux having exceeded this critical value. Even below this critical
value the field still reaches appreciable strength at the end of the kinematic
phase, which is in qualitative agreement with dynamos in periodic domains.
However, for large magnetic Reynolds numbers the field undergoes subsequent
variations on a resistive time scale when, for long periods, the field can be
extremely weak.

observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 021211 made between 143 seconds

filtered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre-Swift
era. We find that the afterglow is best described by (1) propagation through a
wind-swept medium, (2) a cooling break that is blueward of the observed optical
frequencies, and (3) a hard electron energy distribution. However, superimposed
on this ""standard model"" behavior we find significant chromatic variations
within the first few hours after the burst. We consider possible reasons for
these variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.
Finally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and
surrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that GRB 021211's
afterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction of
energy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,
implying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for the
progenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)
moderate source frame extinction. The jet appears to be significantly far from
equipartition and magnetically dominated. More extreme versions of this might
explain the darkness of many afterglows in the Swift era.

We generate catalogues of dark matter (DM) halos and identify emitters with
halos of the same co-moving space density (M(Ly-alpha emitters) ~ 3x10^11
M_sun). We decompose the peculiar velocity field of halos into streaming,
gradient and random components, and compute and analyse these as a function of
scale. Streaming velocities are determined by fluctuations on very large
scales, strongly affected by sample variance, but have a modest impact on the
interpretation of observations. Gradient velocities are the most important as
they distort structures in redshift space, changing the thickness and
orientation of sheets and filaments. Random velocities are typically below or
of the same order as the typical observational uncertainty on the redshift. We
discuss the importance of these effects for the interpretation of data on the
large-scale structure as traced by Ly-alpha emitters (or similar kinds of
astrophysical high-redshift objects), focusing on the induced errors in the
viewing angles of filaments. We compare our predictions of velocity patterns
for Ly-alpha emitters to observations and find that redshift clumping of
Ly-alpha emitters, as reported for instance in the fields of high-redshift
radio galaxies, does not allow to infer whether an observed field is sampling
an early galaxy overdensity.

uncertainties; the z=0 value of the neutral gas mass density, Omega_{g}, is a
factor of ~2 less than Omega_{DLA}. The DLA incidence, n(z), undergoes rapid
evolution between redshifts 5 and 2, but is consistent with the no-evolution
curve in the current concordance cosmology for z ~< 2. We also show that if the
local Schmidt law relating surface density of gas and star formation rate (SFR)
is valid at the DLA redshifts, then the DLA SFR density is too low for them to
provide a significant contribution to the cosmic star formation history (SFH)
at z >~ 1. This implies that the DLAs are unlikely to be the same population as
the star forming galaxies (i.e., the Lyman break and sub-millimeter galaxies)

missing very high column density gas due to its very small absorption cross

Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. We have demonstrated
fifth-order accuracy for WENO in one and two dimensions and performed detailed

of ten of the most luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) known at z>4 (up to
z~6.28). This study includes five new XMM observations and five archived X-ray
observations (four by XMM and one by Chandra). We find that the X-ray power-law
photon indices of our sample, composed of eight radio-quiet sources and two
that are moderately radio loud, are not significantly different from those of
lower redshift AGNs. The upper limits obtained on intrinsic neutral hydrogen
column densities, N_H<~10^{22}-10^{23} cm^{-2}, indicate that these AGNs are
not significantly absorbed. A joint fit performed on our eight radio-quiet
sources, with a total of ~7000 photons, constrains the mean photon index of z>4
radio-quiet AGNs to Gamma=1.97^{+0.06}_{-0.04}, with no detectable intrinsic
dispersion from source to source. We also obtain a strong constraint on the
mean intrinsic column density, N_H<~3x10^{21} cm^{-2}, showing that optically
selected radio-quiet AGNs at z>4 are, on average, not more absorbed than their
lower-redshift counterparts. All this suggests that the X-ray production
mechanism and the central environment in radio-quiet AGNs have not
significantly evolved over cosmic time. The mean equivalent width of a putative
neutral narrow Fe Ka line is constrained to be <~190 eV, and similarly we place
constraints on the mean Compton reflection component (R<~1.2). None of the AGNs
varied on short (~1 hr) timescales, but on longer timescales (months-to-years)
strong variability is observed in four of the sources. In particular, the X-ray
flux of the z=5.41 radio-quiet AGN SDSS 0231-0728 dropped by a factor of ~4
over a rest-frame period of 73 d. This is the most extreme X-ray variation

1806-20. If the initial outflow is relativistic with a bulk Lorentz factor
\Gamma_0\sim {\rm tens}, the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission from
electrons in the forward shock region gives rise to a prominent sub-GeV
emission, if the electron spectrum is hard enough and if the intial Lorentz
factor is high enough. This signal could serve as a diagnosis of the initial
Lorentz factor of the giant flare outflow. This component is potentially
detectable by GLAST if a similar giant flare occurs in the GLAST era. With the
available 10 MeV data, we constrain that \Gamma_0 < 50 if the electron
distribution is a single power law. For a broken power law distribution of
electrons, a higher \Gamma_0 is allowed. At energies higher than 1 GeV, the
flux is lower because of a high energy cut off of the synchrotron emission
component. The synchrotron self-Compton emission component and the inverse
Compton scattering component off the photons in the giant flare oscillation
tail are also considered, but they are found not significant given a moderate
\Gamma_0 (e.g. \leq 10). The forward shock also accelerates cosmic rays to the
maximum energy 10^{17}eV, and generate neutrinos with a typical energy
10^{14}eV through photomeson interaction with the X-ray tail photons. However,
they are too weak to be detectable.

Hbeta emission as a function of velocity suggests that dust along these lines
of sight produces a total visual extinction of A_v ~ 3 at D ~ 6 kpc. This makes
it possible to use optical emission lines to explore the physical conditions of
ionized gas in the inner Galaxy. At a Galactocentric distance R_G ~ 4 kpc, for
example, we find that the H^+ has an rms midplane density of ~ 1 cm^-3 with a

flux of Lyman continuum photons and an increase in the ratio of ionized to
neutral hydrogen toward the inner Galaxy. We have extended the measurements of

limiting magnitude of V=26.1 mag and B=26.3 mag, XMM-Newton observations
finally confirmed it to be the pulsar's X-ray counterpart by detecting X-ray
pulses with the radio pulsar's spin-period. The X-ray pulse profile is
characterized by a single broad peak with a second smaller peak leading the
main pulse component by ~144 degree. The fraction of pulsed photons is (38 +-
7)% with no strong energy dependence in the XMM-Newton bandpass. The pulsar's
X-ray spectrum is well described by a single component power law with photon
index 2.63^{+0.23}_{-0.15}, indicating that the pulsar's X radiation is
dominated by non-thermal emission processes. A low level contribution of
thermal emission from residual cooling or from heated polar caps, cannot be
excluded. The pulsar's spin-down to X-ray energy conversion efficiency is
obtained to be ~16% for the radio dispersion measure inferred pulsar distance.

influence of external force fields is put forward. Starting out from a set of
relativistically covariant, but multiplicative Langevin equations we describe
the relativistic stochastic dynamics of a forced Brownian particle. The
corresponding Fokker-Planck equations are studied in the laboratory frame
coordinates. In particular, the stochastic integration prescription, i.e. the
discretization rule dilemma, is elucidated (pre-point discretization rule {\it
vs.} mid-point discretization rule {\it vs.} post-point discretization rule).
Remarkably, within our relativistic scheme we find that the post-point rule (or
the transport form) yields the only Fokker-Planck dynamics from which the
relativistic Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is recovered as the stationary
solution. The relativistic velocity effects become distinctly more pronounced
by going from one to three spatial dimensions. Moreover, we present numerical
results for the asymptotic mean square displacement of a free relativistic
Brownian particle moving in (1+3) dimensions.

exchange and interaction (CEI) model while the single-particle properties are
described by random matrix theory. We find analytic expressions for both the

function of J_s, the average correction to the peak spacing for an even valley
decreases monotonically, nonetheless staying positive. The rms fluctuation is
of the same order as the average and weakly depends on J_s. For a small
fraction of quantum dots in the ensemble, therefore, the correction to the peak
spacing for the even valley is negative. The correction to the spacing in the
odd valleys is opposite in sign to that in the even valleys and equal in

theory based on the ranking patterns of the strategies and the number of agents

applied to calculate the distribution or probability density function in the

standard deviation in the number of agents making a particular choice (e.g.,
the bar attendance) can be calculated in the efficient phase as a function of

superconductor-ferromagnet systems is the damped oscillatory behavior of the
Cooper pair wave function in a ferromagnet. In some sense, this is analogous to
the inhomogeneous superconductivity, predicted long time ago by Larkin and
Ovchinnikov (1964), and Fulde and Ferrell (1964), and constantly searched since
that. After the qualitative analysis of the peculiarities of the proximity
effect in the presence of the exchange field, the author provides a unified
description of the properties of the superconductor-ferromagnet
heterostructures. Special attention is paid to the striking non-monotonous
dependance of the critical temperature of the multilayers and bilayers on the
ferromagnetic layer thickness and conditions of the realization of the ""Pi""-
Josephson junctions. The recent progress in the preparation of the high quality
hybrid systems permitted to observe on experiments many interesting effects,
which are also discussed in the article. Finally, the author analyzes the
phenomenon of the domain-wall superconductivity and the influence of
superconductivity on the magnetic structure in superconductor-ferromagnet
bilayers.

transverse optic phonons are strongly coupled and we have obtained a model for
this coupling. We observe that the lowest optic branch is always underdamped. A
resolution-limited central peak and quasi-elastic scattering appear in the
vicinity of the Burns temperature. It is shown that it is unlikely that the
quasi-elastic scattering originates from the combined effects of coupling
between TA and TO phonons with an increase of the damping of the TO phonon
below T$_d$. The quasi-elastic scattering has a peak as a function of
temperature close to the peak in the dielectric constant while the intensity of
the central peak scattering increases strongly below this temperature. These
results are discussed in terms of a random field model for relaxors.

calculated with an effective transition operator acting between model $4f^N$

semi-empirical crystal Hamiltonian. The difference of the effective transition
operator from the original transition operator is the corrections due to mixing
in transition initial and final states of excited configurations from both the
center ion and the ligand ions. These corrections are calculated using
many-body perturbation theory. For free ions, there are important one-body and
two-body corrections. The one-body correction is proportional to the original
electric dipole operator with magnitude of approximately 40% of the uncorrected
electric dipole moment. Its effect is equivalent to scaling down the radial
integral $\ME {5d} r {4f}$, to about 60% of the uncorrected HF value. The
two-body correction has magnitude of approximately 25% relative to the
uncorrected electric dipole moment. For ions in crystals, there is an
additional one-body correction due to ligand polarization, whose magnitude is
shown to be about 10% of the uncorrected electric dipole moment.

  High Dimensional Spaces","17 pages",,,"TR-04-08","cs.DB cs.AI",,"  The task of outlier detection is to find small groups of data objects that
are exceptional when compared with rest large amount of data. Detection of such
outliers is important for many applications such as fraud detection and
customer migration. Most such applications are high dimensional domains in
which the data may contain hundreds of dimensions. However, the outlier
detection problem itself is not well defined and none of the existing
definitions are widely accepted, especially in high dimensional space. In this
paper, our first contribution is to propose a unified framework for outlier
detection in high dimensional spaces from an ensemble-learning viewpoint. In
our new framework, the outlying-ness of each data object is measured by fusing
outlier factors in different subspaces using a combination function.
Accordingly, we show that all existing researches on outlier detection can be
regarded as special cases in the unified framework with respect to the set of
subspaces considered and the type of combination function used. In addition, to
demonstrate the usefulness of the ensemble-learning based outlier detection
framework, we developed a very simple and fast algorithm, namely SOE1 (Subspace
Outlier Ensemble using 1-dimensional Subspaces) in which only subspaces with
one dimension is used for mining outliers from large categorical datasets. The
SOE1 algorithm needs only two scans over the dataset and hence is very
appealing in real data mining applications. Experimental results on real
datasets and large synthetic datasets show that: (1) SOE1 has comparable
performance with respect to those state-of-art outlier detection algorithms on
identifying true outliers and (2) SOE1 can be an order of magnitude faster than
one of the fastest outlier detection algorithms known so far.

reasoning about distances. We demonstrate that our approach is insensitive to
potentially ad hoc articulations of distance by showing that it is intrinsic to
an underlying uniformity. We provide a logical characterization of this

instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation, we obtain the mass $2658\pm 15$ MeV for
the first excited state, which is about 26 MeV heavier than the experimental
value $2632\pm 1.7$ MeV. By means of PCAC and low-energy theorem we calculate
the transition matrix elements and obtain the decay widths:
$\Gamma(D^{+}_{sJ}\to D^{+}_s\eta)=4.07\pm 0.34$ MeV, $\Gamma(D^{+}_{sJ}\to
D^{0}K^{+}) \simeq \Gamma(\Gamma(D^{+}_{sJ}\to D^{+}K^{0})=8.9\pm 1.2$ MeV, and
the ratio $\Gamma(D^{+}_{sJ}\to D^{0}K^{+})/\Gamma(D^{+}_{sJ}\to

SELEX data $0.14\pm 0.06$. The summed decay width of those three channels is
approximately 21.7 MeV, already larger than the observed bound for the full
width ($\leq 17$ MeV). Furthermore, assuming $D_{sJ}^+(2632)$ is $1^{-}$ state,
we also explore the possibility of $S-D$ wave mixing to explain the SELEX
observation. Based on our analysis, we suspect that it is too early to conclude
that $D^{+}_{sJ}(2632)$ is the first radial excitation of the $1^{-}$ ground

the total decay width are urgently required especially for $S-D$ wave mixing.

the Nambu-Goto partition function. In our approach, the world-sheet duality

Liouville field theory. This result is based on a seminal work by Stoyanovsky.
Here, we discuss the implications of this correspondence focusing on its
application to string theory on curved backgrounds. For instance, we analyze
how the divergences corresponding to worldsheet instantons in AdS_3 can be
understood as arising from the insertion of the dual screening operator in the
Liouville theory side. We also study the pole structure of N-point functions in
the 2D Euclidean black hole and its holographic meaning in terms of the Little
String Theory. This enables us to interpret the correspondence between CFTs as
encoding a LSZ-type reduction procedure. Furthermore, we discuss the scattering
amplitudes violating the winding number conservation in those backgrounds and
provide a formula connecting such amplitudes with observables in Liouville
field theory. Finally, we study the WZNW correlation functions in the limit k
-> 0 and show that, at the point k=0, the Stoyanovsky-Ribault-Teschner
dictionary turns out to be in agreement with the FZZ conjecture at a particular
point of the space of parameters where the Liouville central charge becomes

in the four-point amplitude determines the soft, or cusp, anomalous dimension

by a 2+1-dimensional U(k) gauge theory. This theory has been identified by
Acharya and Vafa as the U(k) gauge theory with 4 supercharges broken by a
Chern-Simons term of level N in such a way that 2 supercharges are preserved.
We argue further that the gauge coupling of the domain wall gauge theory goes
like g^2 ~ Lambda/N, for large N. In the case of two domain walls, we show that
the U(2) world-volume theory generates a quadratic potential on the Coulomb
branch at two loops in perturbation theory which is consistent with there being
a supersymmetric bound state of the two wall system. A mass gap of order
Lambda/N is generated around the supersymmetric minimum and we estimate the
size of the bound-state to be order Lambda/ \sqrt N. At large distance the
potential reaches a constant that can qualitatively account for the binding
energy of the two walls even though stringy effects are not, strictly speaking,

during the spring semester of 2005. They cover the basic ideas of a new,
geometric approach to geometric measure theory. They begin with a new theory of
exterior calculus at a single point. This infinitesimal theory extends, by
linearity, to a discrete exterior theory, based at finitely many points. A
general theory of calculus culminates by taking limits in Banach spaces, and is
valid for domains called ``chainlets'' which are defined to be elements of the
Banach spaces. Chainlets include manifolds, rough domains (e.g., fractals),
soap films, foliations, and Euclidean space. Most of the work is at the level
of the infinitesimal calculus, at a single point. The number of limits needed
to get to the full theory is minimal. Tangent spaces are not used in these
notes, although they can be defined within the theory. This new approach is
made possible by giving the Grassmann algebra more geometric structure. As a
result, much of geometric measure theory is simplified. Geometry is restored
and significant results from the classical theory are expanded. Applications
include existence of solutions to a problem of Plateau, an optimal Gauss-Green
theorem and new models for Maxwell's equations.

When S is actually associative, Assoc(S) = F; that is the trivial case. In

server station contains $N_i$ units, $i=1,2,...,r$, where all the values $N_i$
are large numbers of the same order. The total number of client stations is
equal to $k$. The expected times between departures in the client stations are
small values of the order $O(N^{-1})$ ~ $(N=N_1+N_2+...+N_r)$. After service

the Vlasov equation, and its applications to the study of isoscalar vibrations
in heavy nuclei are reviewed. It is argued that the Vlasov equation can be used
to study the response of small quantum systems like (heavy) nuclei in regimes
for which the finite size of the system is more important than the collisions
between constituents. This requires solving the linearized Vlasov equation for
finite systems, however, in this case the problem of choosing appropriate
boundary conditions for the fluctuations of the phase-space-density is
non-trivial. Calculations of the isoscalar response functions performed by
using different boundary conditions, corresponding to fixed and moving nuclear
surface, are compared for different multipoles and it is found that, in a
sharp-surface model, the moving-surface boundary conditions give better
agreement with experiment. The semiclassical strength functions given by this
theory are strikingly similar to the results of analogous quantum calculations,
in spite of the fact that shell effects are not included in the theory, this
happens because of a well known close relation between classical trajectories
and shell structure.

work is to demonstrate an improvement in image spatial resolution in realistic

the signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer. Images of the TORMAM
mammographic image quality phantom were recorded using the standard
magnification settings of 1.8 magnification/fine focus and also at 1.8
magnification/broad focus and 3.0 magnification/fine focus; the latter two
arrangements would normally give rise to unacceptable geometric blurring.
Measured point-spread functions were used in conjunction with the MEM image
processing to de-blur these images. The results are presented as comparative
images of phantom test features and as observer scores for the raw and
processed images. Visualization of high resolution features and the total image
scores for the test phantom were improved by the application of the MEM
processing. It is argued that this successful demonstration of image
de-blurring in noisy radiological images offers the possibility of weakening
the link between focal spot size and geometric blurring in radiology, thus
opening up new approaches to system optimization.
