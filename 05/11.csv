provided UVES spectra of seven stars near the red giant branch bump (R=40000,

$\rho=\Lambda+\rho_{01}a^{-3(1+w)}+\rho_{02}a^{\beta}+\rho_{03}a^{-3}$, which
is commonly used in cosmology. The FRW model filled with scaling fluid (called
homological) is confronted with the observations of distant type Ia supernovae.
We found the class of model parameters admissible by the statistical analysis
of SNIa data. We showed that the model with scaling fluid fits well to
supernovae data. We found that $\Omega_{\text{m},0} \simeq 0.4$ and $n \simeq
-1$ ($\beta = -3n$), which can correspond to (hyper) phantom fluid, and to a
high density universe. However if we assume prior that
$\Omega_{\text{m},0}=0.3$ then the favoured model is close to concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our results predict that in the considered model with
scaling fluids distant type Ia supernovae should be brighter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model, while intermediate distant SNIa should be fainter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate whether the model with scaling fluid is
actually preferred by data over $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result we find from
the Akaike model selection criterion prefers the model with noninteracting

ionization states of the elements and the velocities derived from the line
profiles: the highly ionized atoms have the highest outflow velocity while the
neutral lines have the lowest outflow velocity. The recent HST image of Hen
2-90 reveals a bipolar, highly ionized region, a neutral disk-like structure
and an intermediate region of moderate ionization. It seems that a
non-spherical stellar wind model is a good option to explain the ionization and
spatial distribution of the circumstellar material. We modelled the forbidden
lines under the assumption of a non-spherically symmetric wind based on the HST
image. We find that in order to fit the observed line luminosities, the mass
flux, surface temperature, and terminal wind velocities need to be latitude
dependent, which might be explained in terms of a rapidly rotating central
star. A rotation speed of 75-80 % of the critical velocity has been derived.
The total mass loss rate of the star was determined to be of order 3 10^{-5}

the manifestation of the effect. Redshifted cosmological objects, such as
high-z galaxies and supernovae in high-z galaxies, are also subjected to
luminosity dimming due to relativistic aberration, although the correcting
terms encompassing spectral redshift and time dilation are used to scale the
observed magnitudes in the restframe template. The Universe's expansion results
in elongation of distances to the objects from the moment of emission to the
present time related to the z = 0 local space; this elongation is equal to the
apparent increase of the distance from the apparent size to the restframe
distance in the theory of special relativity due to the effect of relativistic
aberration. Contrary to the standard Big Bang model with stationary space, the
effect of relativistic aberration zeroes in the expending space model; if local

issue of PSF variation with time and field position near the guide star. In
fact, because a natural guide star is still necessary for correction of the

discuss six methods for characterizing LGS AO PSF variation that can
potentially improve the determination of the PSF away from the laser spot, that
is, off-axis. Calibration images of dense star fields are used to determine the

  We performed a systematic simulation campaign and found that, when the time
elapsed between two bursts of star formation is larger than 0.8 dex, the
properties of each episode can be constrained with a precision of 0.04 dex in

novel form of ray tracing that can neither be classified as long, nor as short
characteristics, but which applies the underlying principles, i.e. efficient
execution through interpolation and parallelizability, of both. Primary
applications of the hybrid characteristics method are radiation hydrodynamics
problems that take into account the effects of photoionization and heating due
to point sources of radiation. The method is implemented in the hydrodynamics
package FLASH. The ionization, heating, and cooling processes are modelled
using the DORIC ionization package. Upon comparison with the long
characteristics method, we find that our method calculates the column density
with a similarly high accuracy and produces sharp and well defined shadows. We
show the quality of the new algorithm in an application to the photoevaporation
of multiple over-dense clumps. We present several test problems demonstrating
the feasibility of our method for performing high resolution three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamics calculations that span a large range of scales. Initial
performance tests show that the ray tracing part of our method takes less time
to execute than other parts of the calculation (e.g. hydrodynamics and adaptive
mesh refinement), and that a high degree of efficiency is obtained in parallel
execution. Although the hybrid characteristics method is developed for problems
involving photoionization due to point sources, the algorithm can be easily
adapted to the case of more general radiation fields.

conducted at four wavelengths - 20, 11, 6, and 3 cm, over a 4-year period, and
achieves an rms sensitivity of about 10 microJy at each wavelength. We describe
the observations and data reduction processes, and present data on radio
sources close to the centre of the HDF-S. We discuss in detail the properties
of a subset of these sources. The sources include both starburst galaxies and
galaxies powered by an active galactic nucleus, and range in redshift from 0.1
to 2.2. Some of them are characterised by unusually high radio-to-optical
luminosities, presumably caused by dust extinction.

the massive primary star Eta Carinae on the winds blown by the primary and the
secondary. The two winds collide with each other after passing through two
respective shock waves, and escape the system while strongly emitting in the
X-ray band. While during most of the 5.5 years orbital period, the companion's
gravity has a negligible effect on the winds, we find that near periastron, the
companion's gravity may significantly influence the flow and the companion
might accrete from the primary's wind under certain circumstances. Near
periastron passage, the collision region of the two winds may collapse onto the
secondary star, a process that could substantially reduce the X-ray luminosity.
We suggest that such an accretion process produces the long, almost flat, X-ray
minimum in Eta Carinae.

focus on the role of the nuclear reactions rates and mass loss. We consider
masses 3<M/Msun<6.5 for a metallicity typical for Globular Cluster, Z=0.001,
and compare the results obtained by computing the full nucleosynthesis with hot
bottom burning (HBB), for a network of 30 elements, using either the NACRE or
the Cameron & Fowler (1988) cross-sections. The results differ in particular
with respect to the Na23 nucleosynthesis (which is more efficient in the NACRE
case) and the magnesium isotopes ratios. For both choices, however, the CNO
nucleosynthesis shows that the C+N+O is constant within a factor of two, in our
models employing a very efficient convection treatment. Different mass loss
rates alter the physical conditions for HBB and the length of the AGB phase,
changing indirectly the chemical yields. These computations show that the
predictive power of our AGB models is undermined by these uncertainties. In
particular, it appears at the moment very difficult to strongly accept or
dismiss that these sources play a key-role in the pollution of Globular

unprecedented measurements of physical parameters (i.e. structure and

feasible is blind-pointing on (faint) science targets? Are VLTI observations
still efficiently feasible if these faint science targets exceed the usual
angular distance (<=1arcmin) to a GuideStar [...]? How is the fringe-tracking

contribution of internal gravity waves to the transport of angular momentum and
chemicals over long time-scales in stars. We show that the development of a

this filter produces momentum extraction from the core when it is rotating
faster than the surface. Using only this filtered flux, it is possible to
follow the contribution of internal waves over long (evolutionary) time-scales.
  We then present the evolution of the internal rotation profile using this
formalism for stars which are spun down via magnetic torquing. We show that
waves tend to slow down the core, creating a ""slow"" front that may then
propagate from the core to the surface. Further spin down of the surface leads
to the formation of a new front. Finally we show how this momentum transport
reduces rotational mixing in a 1.2Msun, Z=0.02 model, leading to a surface
lithium abundance in agreement with observations in the Hyades.

Asakura and F. Oosawa, J. Chem. Phys. 22, 1255 (1954)]. The effective model is
defined by a single dimensionless parameter -- the ratio of the polymer
diameter to the effective colloid diameter. For high salt-to-counterion

to compute the fluid phase diagram, which describes demixing into colloid-rich

interactions shifts the demixing binodal toward higher polymer concentration,
stabilizing the mixture. The enhanced stability is attributed to a weakening of

corresponding increase in the liquid-vapor interfacial tension. The predicted

method is used as a model for the solvent in order to take into account the
hydrodynamic mass and momentum transport through the solvent. The colloidal
particles are propagated via MD and they are coupled to the LB fluid by viscous
forces. With respect to the LB fluid, the colloids are represented by uniformly
distributed points on a sphere. Each such point (with a velocity V(r) at any
off-lattice position r is interacting with the neighboring eight LB nodes by a
frictional force F=\xi_0(V(r)-u(r)) with \xi_0 being a friction force and u(r)
being the velocity of the fluid at the position r. Thermal fluctuations are
introduced in the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics. This coupling scheme
has been proposed recently for polymer systems by Ahlrichs and D""unweg [J.
Chem. Phys. 111, 8225 (1999)]. We investigate several properties of a single
colloidal particle in a LB fluid, namely the effective Stokes friction and long
time tails in the autocorrelation functions for the translational and
rotational velocity. Moreover, a charged colloidal system is considered
consisting of a macroion, counterions and coions that are coupled to a LB
fluid. We study the behavior of the ions in a constant electric field. In
particular, an estimate of the effective charge of the macroion is yielded from
the number of counterions that move with the macroion in the direction of the
electric field.

chains in good solvents. The simplest bounded potential is that of penetrable
spheres, which takes a positive finite value if the two spheres are overlapped,
being 0 otherwise. Even in the one-dimensional case, the penetrable-rod model
is far from trivial, since interactions are not restricted to nearest neighbors
and so its exact solution is not known. In this paper we first derive the exact
correlation functions of penetrable-rod fluids to second order in density at
any temperature, as well as in the high-temperature and zero-temperature limits
at any density. Next, two simple analytic theories are constructed: a
high-temperature approximation based on the exact asymptotic behavior in the
limit $T\to\infty$ and a low-temperature approximation inspired by the exact
result in the opposite limit $T\to 0$. Finally, we perform Monte Carlo
simulations for a wide range of temperatures and densities to assess the
validity of both theories. It is found that they complement each other quite
well, exhibiting a good agreement with the simulation data within their
respective domains of applicability and becoming practically equivalent on the
borderline of those domains. A perspective on the extension of both approaches

conductivity coefficient which diverges logarithmically with the lattice size.
Conversely, conductivity is found to be finite in the high--temperature
disordered phase. Simulations close to the transition temperature are insted
limited by slow convergence that is presumably due to the slow kinetics of
vortex pairs.

deviate from the vertical direction defined by the flat mean interface
position. This leads to a nonzero mean value of the corresponding polar tilt
angle which renders a characterization of the thermal state of an interface.
Based on the concept of an effective interface Hamiltonian we determine the
variances of the local interface position and of its lateral derivatives. This
leads to the probability distribution functions for the metric of the interface
and for the tilt angle which allows us to calculate its mean value and its mean
square deviation. We compare the temperature dependences of these quantities as
predicted by the simple capillary wave model, by an improved phenomenological
model, and by the microscopic effective interface Hamiltonian derived from
density functional theory. The mean tilt angle discriminates clearly between
these theoretical approaches and emphasizes the importance of the variation of
the surface tension at small wave lengths. Also the tilt angle two-point
correlation function is determined which renders an additional structural
characterization of interfacial fluctuations. Various experimental accesses to

all of which are closely associated to two-surfaces of zero outward null
expansion. In this paper we show that three-surfaces which can be foliated with
such two-surfaces are suitable boundaries in both a quasilocal action and a
phase space formulation of general relativity. The resulting formalism provides
expressions for the quasilocal energy and angular momentum associated with the
horizon. The values of the energy and angular momentum are in agreement with
those derived from the isolated and dynamical horizon frameworks.

founded and formulated in a very general manner. From this starting point we
analyse in which way these results may give us the opportunity to gain a better
understanding in the thermodynamics of ordinary systems for which a
pre-relativistic description is sufficient. First, we investigated the
possibility to introduce an alternative definition of the entropy basically
related to a local definition of the order in a spacetime model rather than a
counting of microstates. We show that such an alternative approach exists and
leads to the traditional results provided an equilibrium condition is assumed.
This condition introduces a relation between a time interval and the reverse of
the temperature. We show that such a relation extensively used in the black
hole theory, mainly as a mathematical trick, has a very general and physical
meaning here; in particular its derivation is not related to the existence of a
canonical density matrix. Our dynamical approach of thermodynamic equilibrium
allows us to establish a relation between action and entropy and we show that
an identical relation exists in the case of black holes. The derivation of such
a relation seems impossible in the Gibbs ensemble approach of statistical
thermodynamics. From these results we suggest that the definition of entropy in
terms of order in spacetime should be more general that the Boltzmann one based
on a counting of microstates. Finally we point out that these results are
obtained by reversing the traditional route going from the Schr\""{o}dinger
equation to statistical thermodynamics.

$\delta \mathcal{L}_{H}$ which is generally singular in the continuum limit.
There exists one parameterization of the pion fields only, for which the weight
factor is equal to unity and $\delta \mathcal{L}_{H}=0$, respectively. This
unique parameterization ensures selfconsistency of the MF approximation. We use
it to calculate thermal Green functions of the pion gas in the MF approximation

the familiar diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the second quantized
formulation. A hidden local gauge symmetry, which is associated with the
arbitrariness of the phase choice of a complete orthonormal basis set, becomes
explicit in this formulation (in particular, in the adiabatic approximation)
and specifies physical observables. The choice of a basis set which specifies
the coordinate in the functional space is arbitrary in the second quantization,
and a sub-class of coordinate transformations, which keeps the form of the
action invariant, is recognized as the gauge symmetry. We discuss the
implications of this hidden local gauge symmetry in detail by analyzing
geometric phases for cyclic and noncyclic evolutions. It is shown that the
hidden local symmetry provides a basic concept alternative to the notion of
holonomy to analyze geometric phases and that the analysis based on the hidden
local gauge symmetry leads to results consistent with the general prescription
of Pancharatnam. We however note an important difference between the geometric
phases for cyclic and noncyclic evolutions. We also explain a basic difference
between our hidden local gauge symmetry and a gauge symmetry (or equivalence
class) used by Aharonov and Anandan in their definition of generalized
geometric phases.

microsystem, S, coupled to a finite macroscopic measuring instrument, I, which
itself is an N-particle quantum system. The pointer positions of I correspond
to the macrostates of this instrument, as represented by orthogonal subspaces
of the Hilbert space of its pure states. These subspaces, or 'phase cells', are
the simultaneous eigenspaces of a set of coarse grained intercommuting
macroscopic observables, M, and, crucially, are of astronomically large
dimensionalities, which incease exponentially with N. We formulate conditions
on the conservative dynamics of the composite (S+I) under which it yields both
a reduction of the wave packet describing the state of S and a one-to-one
correspondence, following a measurement, between the pointer position of I and
the resultant state of S; and we show that these conditions are fulfilled by

Hopf algebra H, we define a braided functor J from B to the category Mod_H of
left H-modules. The functor J, together with the set of generators of B,
provides an algebraic method to study the range of quantum invariants of links.
The braided Hopf algebra action on bottom tangles is mapped by J to the
standard braided Hopf algebra structure for H in Mod_H.
  Several notions in knot theory, such as genus, unknotting number, ribbon
knots, boundary links, local moves, etc are given algebraic interpretations in

rate, interest spread, historical volatility, implied volatility and exchange

2002, the interest rate dominated. In the first six months of 2003, the foreign

perhaps nature has already done so and tubulin and MTs already play such a role

must describe relations between systems. Using a simple model, we investigate
how such a relational quantum theory naturally arises by promoting reference
systems to the status of dynamical entities. Our goal is to demonstrate using
elementary quantum theory how any quantum mechanical experiment admits a purely
relational description at a fundamental level, from which the original
""non-relational"" theory emerges in a semi-classical limit. According to this
thesis, the non-relational theory is therefore an approximation of the
fundamental relational theory. We propose four simple rules that can be used to
translate an ""orthodox"" quantum mechanical description into a relational
description, independent of an external spacial reference frame or clock. The
techniques used to construct these relational theories are motivated by a
Bayesian approach to quantum mechanics, and rely on the noiseless subsystem
method of quantum information science used to protect quantum states against
undesired noise. The relational theory naturally predicts a fundamental
decoherence mechanism, so an arrow of time emerges from a time-symmetric
theory. Moreover, there is no need for a ""collapse of the wave packet"" in our
model: the probability interpretation is only applied to diagonal density
operators. Finally, the physical states of the relational theory can be
described in terms of ""spin networks"" introduced by Penrose as a combinatorial
description of geometry, and widely studied in the loop formulation of quantum
gravity. Thus, our simple bottom-up approach (starting from the semi-classical
limit to derive the fully relational quantum theory) may offer interesting
insights on the low energy limit of quantum gravity.

fidelity that can be attained using joint-measurement protocols for estimating
its purity. We prove that in the asymptotic $N\to\infty$ limit,
separable-measurement protocols can be as efficient as the optimal
joint-measurement one if classical communication is used. This in turn shows
that the optimal estimation of the entanglement of a two-qubit state can also
be achieved asymptotically with fully separable measurements. The relationship
between our global Bayesian approach and the quantum Cramer-Rao bound is also
discussed.
