remaining gas out of the cluster. Especially winds of massive stars and
definitely the on-set of the first supernovae can remove the residual gas from
a cluster. This leads to a very violent mass-loss and leaves the cluster out of
dynamical equilibrium. Standard models predict that within the cluster volume
the star formation efficiency (SFE) has to be about 33 per cent for sudden
(within one crossing-time of the cluster) gas expulsion to retain some of the
stars in a bound cluster. If the efficiency is lower the stars of the cluster
disperse mostly. Recent observations reveal that in strong star bursts star
clusters do not form in isolation but in complexes containing dozens and up to
several hundred star clusters, i.e. in super-clusters. By carrying out
numerical experiments for such objects placed at distances >= 10 kpc from the
centre of the galaxy we demonstrate that under these conditions (i.e. the
deeper potential of the star cluster complex and the merging process of the
star clusters within these super-clusters) the SFEs can be as low as 20 per
cent and still leave a gravitationally bound stellar population. Such an object
resembles the outer Milky Way globular clusters and the faint fuzzy star

Navarro-Frenk-White profile with concentration parameter, c = 6.1 +/- 1.2, and
virial radius, R_vir = 2.9 +/- 0.4 Mpc. However, inside the core the

forming galaxies at redshifts below z~0.6, at higher redshifts their SFR
density is too low for them to provide a significant contribution to the cosmic
star formation history (SFH). This suggests that the majority of DLAs may be a
distinct population from the Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) or submillimeter
star-forming galaxies that together dominate the SFR density at high redshift.
It is also possible that the DLAs do not trace the bulk of the neutral gas at
high redshift. The metallicity properties of DLAs are consistent with this
interpretation. The DLAs show a metal mass density lower by two orders of
magnitude at all redshifts than that inferred from the SFH of the universe.
These results are consistent with DLAs being dominated by low mass systems
having low SFRs or a late onset of star formation, similar to the star
formation histories of dwarf galaxies in the local universe.

statistics of early-type, or red, and late-type, or blue, galaxies, with the
fraction of early type galaxies at halo centers, relative to the total sample,
determined only by the halo mass and the same fraction in the case of
satellites is taken to be dependent on both the halo mass and the satellite
galaxy luminosity. This simple model describes the conditional luminosity
functions, LF of galaxies as a function of the halo mass, measured with the 2dF
galaxy group catalog from cluster to group mass scales. Using 2dF measurements,
we extract information related to conditional mass function for halos from
extreme voids to dense regions in terms of the galaxy overdensity. We also
calculate the probability distribution function of halo mass, as a function of
the galaxy overdensity, and use these probabilities to address preferred
environments of red and blue galaxies. Our model also allow us to make
predictions, for example, galaxy bias as a function of the galaxy type and
luminosity, the void mass function, and the average galaxy luminosity as a
function of the density environment.

flat spacetime of general relativity. We concentrate our investigation to the

of the star is started from a differentially rotating equilibrium star of T/W ~
0.16 (T is the rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational binding
energy of the equilibrium star), depleting the pressure to initiate the
collapse and to exceed the threshold of dynamical bar instability. Our finding
is that the collapsing star potentially forms a bar when the star has a
toroidal structure due to the redistribution of the angular momentum at the
core bounce. On the other hand, the collapsing star weakly forms a bar when the
star has a spheroidal structure. We also find that the bar structure of the
star is destroyed when the torus is destroyed in the rotational core collapse.
Since the collapse of a toroidal star potentially forms a bar, it can be a
promising source of gravitational waves which will be detected in advanced
LIGO.

dominate the longest modes that are typically much larger than the present

inflationary perturbation calculation predicted by the BEFT formalism is likely
to be associated with a feature in the perturbation spectrum, and we discuss
the observational signatures of this feature in both CMB and large scale

TV to perform high statistics studies of cosmic rays in space and search for
antimatter and dark matter. This will be possible because of the large
geometrical acceptance, a very accurate energy determination and a very precise
particle identification through redundant measurements of its energy, velocity
and electric charge. AMS is scheduled to be placed on the ISS at the beginning
of 2008 for a 3 year exposure.

clarifying reliability issues that have surfaced since the publication of the

such as scan-phase discontinuities and effects of external hits. These defects
can be repaired when re-reducing the raw data. Instabilities in the
great-circle reduction process are recognised and identified in a number of
data sets. These resulted mainly from the difficult observing conditions
imposed by the anomalous orbit of the satellite. The stability of the basic
angle over the mission is confirmed, but the connectivity between the two
fields of view has been less than optimal for some parts of the sky. Both are
fundamental conditions for producing absolute parallaxes. Although there is
clear room for improvement of the Hipparcos data, the catalogue as published
remains generally reliable within the quoted accuracies. Some of the findings
presented here are also relevant for the forthcoming Gaia mission.

the justifications of which are described in the accompanying paper. The
emphasis is on those aspects of the data analysis that are fundamentally
different from the ones used for the catalogue published in 1997. The new
reduction uses a dynamical modelling of the satellite's attitude. It
incorporates provisions for scan-phase discontinuities and hits, most of which
have now been identified. Solutions for the final along-scan attitude (the
reconstruction of the satellite's scan phase), the abscissa corrections and the
instrument model, originally solved simultaneously in the great-circle
solution, are now de-coupled. This is made possible by starting the solution
iterations with the astrometric data from the published catalogue. The
de-coupling removes instabilities that affected great-circle solutions for
short data sets in the published data. The modelling-noise reduction implies
smaller systematic errors, which is reflected in a reduction of the
abscissa-error correlations by about a factor 40. Special care is taken to
ensure that measurements from both fields of view contribute significantly to
the along-scan attitude solution. This improves the overall connectivity of the
data and rigidity of the reconstructed sky, which is of critical importance to
the reliability of the astrometric data. The changes in the reduction process
and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the satellite result in
considerable formal-error reductions for stars brighter than 8th magnitude.

explosions in simulations of cosmological structure formation. Our model
includes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in dense
collapsed gas clumps. Metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar medium
by star particles using a local SPH smoothing kernel. A variety of chemical
abundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to the
different yields and lifetimes of SNII and SNIa progenitor stars. In the case
of SNII chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. Because of the
sensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactic
haloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infall
and the build up of the stellar components. Indeed, in simulations of isolated
galaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent cooling
produces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with a
primordial cooling function. In the highly-enriched central regions, the
evolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here the
gas is always dense enough to cool. A similar situation is found in
cosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes which
could spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffuse
gas. We demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adopt
super-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar mass
and in the metal distributions. We also find that the impact of metallicity on
the star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particular
evolutionary history. Our results hence emphasise the importance of feedback
processes for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment.

by an r^1/4 surface brightness law. The host galaxies of high redshift BL Lacs
are large (<R(e)> ~7 kpc) and very luminous (<M(K)> = -27.9+-0.7), ~3 mag
brighter than L*, and ~1 mag brighter than brightest cluster galaxies. They are
also ~1 mag brighter than low redshift radio galaxies and appear to deviate
from their K-z relationship. On the other hand, the high luminosities agree
with the few optical studies of high redshift BL Lac hosts. The nuclear
luminosity and the nucleus-galaxy luminosity ratio of the high redshift BL Lacs
are much larger than those in low redshift BL Lacs. This may be due to either a
higher intrinsic nuclear luminosity, or enhanced luminosity because of strong
beaming. Contrary to what is observed in low redshift BL Lacs, the luminosities
of the host galaxy and of the nucleus are fairly well correlated, as expected
from the black hole mass - bulge luminosity relationship. High redshift BL Lacs
radiate with a wide range of power with respect to their Eddington luminosity,
and this power is intermediate between those in nearby BL Lacs and in luminous
radio-loud quasars. The high redshift BL Lac host galaxies appear to be ~2 mag
brighter than those at low redshift. This is likely due to a strong selection
effect in the surveys of BL Lacs that makes observable only the most luminous
sources at z > 0.5 and produces a correlation between the nuclear and the host
luminosity. However, this may also suggest strong luminosity evolution which is
inconsistent with a simple passive evolution of the host galaxies, and requires
a contribution from relatively recent star formation episodes.

0.4 msun (5 sigma detection in a 14'' beam), we detect a total of 91 protostars
and prestellar cores. Of these, 80% lie in clusters, representative of star
formation across the Galaxy. Two of the groups of cores are associated with the
young stellar clusters IC348 and NGC1333, and are consistent with a steady or
reduced star formation rate in the last 0.5 Myr, but not an increasing one. In
Perseus, 40--60% of cores are in small clusters (< 50 msun) and isolated
objects, much more than the 10% suggested from infrared studies. Complementing
the dust continuum, we present a C^18O map of the whole cloud at 1' resolution.
The gas and dust show filamentary structure of the dense gas on large and small
scales, with the high column density filaments breaking up into clusters of
cores. The filament mass per unit length is 5--11 msun per 0.1 pc. Given these
filament masses, there is no requirement for substantial large scale flows
along or onto the filaments in order to gather sufficient material for star
formation. We find that the probability of finding a submillimetre core is a
strongly increasing function of column density, as measured by C^18O integrated
intensity, prob(core) proportional to I^3.0. This power law relation holds down
to low column density, suggesting that there is no A_v threshold for star
formation in Perseus, unless all the low-A_v submm cores can be demonstrated to
be older protostars which have begun to lose their natal molecular cloud.

an hole transfer process from [AlO4]0 centers to diamagnetic precursors of E'

Josephson relation gives room to the next harmonics. Within quasiclassical
approach we calculate the Josephson relation taking into account magnetic
scattering. We find that the observed minimum is compatible with the value of
the second harmonics expected from the theory.

Surprisingly, a persistent spin current is found to flow along the confined

This provides an interesting example of constant spin flowing without inducing
a spin accumulation, contrary to common intuition.

simulations of black hole systems is through fixed or adaptive mesh refinement
techniques. We describe a manifestation of numerical interface truncation error
which appears as slowly converging, artificial reflections from refinement
boundaries in a broad class of mesh refinement implementations, potentially
compromising the effectiveness of mesh refinement techniques for some numerical
relativity applications if left untreated. We elucidate this numerical effect
by presenting a model problem which exhibits the phenomenon, but which is
simple enough that its numerical error can be understood analytically. Our
analysis shows that the effect is caused by variations in finite differencing
error generated across low and high resolution regions, and that its slow
convergence is caused by the presence of dramatic speed differences among
propagation modes typical of 3+1 relativity. Lastly, we resolve the problem,
presenting a class of finite differencing stencil modifications, termed
mesh-adapted differencing (MAD), which eliminate this pathology in both our
model problem and in numerical relativity examples.

semiamplitude of the star's radial velocity K. Indeed, it affects the
determination of the mass m of the planet which, in turn, induces a systematic
error in the Keplerian period P^(0) of \sim 8 s. It is of crucial importance
because P^(0) should be subtracted from the measured period in order to extract
the relativistic correction. The present-day uncertainty in $m$ does not yet
make necessary the inclusion of relativistic corrections in the data-reduction
process of the determination of the system's parameters. The present situation
could change only if improvements of one-two orders of magnitude in the
ground-based Doppler spectroscopy technique occurred.

electron antineutrinos from the Sun constrains the electromagnetic properties

production in the solar magnetic fields, assuming the neutrinos are Majorana
particles with a relatively large transition moment. We consider fields both in
the radiative and convective zones of the Sun, with physically plausible
strengths, and take into account the recently established values of the
oscillation parameters. Our analysis shows that the production rate in question
is presently unobservable. In the radiative zone, it is suppressed by the large
measured value of the flavor mixing angle which eliminates the resonant level
crossing. A corresponding general resonance condition, valid for large as well
as small values of the mixing angle, is derived. Likewise, in the convective
zone, the strength of the small-scale magnetic field is likely insufficient.
Thus, no useful bound on the neutrino transition moment can be derived from the
published KamLAND bound. KamLAND may be, however, on the edge of probing an
``optimistic'' scenario, making further improvements of its sensitivity
desirable.

isotropization and thermal equilibration rates agree. For a weak-coupling
$\phi^4$-model the relaxation-time approximation underestimates the thermal
equilibration time by orders of magnitude, in contrast to the isotropization
time. The characteristic nonequilibrium isotropization rate can be enhanced as
compared to the close-to-equilibrium value. Our results are obtained from the

statistics of oceanic internal gravity waves based on wave turbulence theory

the collision integral in the kinetic equation diverges for almost all spectral
power-law exponents. These divergences come from resonant interactions with the
smallest horizontal wavenumbers and/or the largest horizontal wavenumbers with
extreme scale-separations. We identify a small domain in which the
scale-invariant collision integral converges and numerically find a convergent
power-law solution. This numerical solution is close to the Garrett--Munk
spectrum. Power-law exponents which potentially permit a balance between the
infra-red and ultra-violet divergences are investigated. The balanced exponents
are generalizations of an exact solution of the scale-invariant kinetic
equation, the Pelinovsky--Raevsky spectrum. A balance between oppositely signed
divergences states that infinity minus infinity may be approximately equal to
zero. A small but finite Coriolis parameter representing the effects of
rotation is introduced into the kinetic equation to determine solutions over
the divergent part of the domain using rigorous asymptotic arguments. This
gives rise to the induced diffusion regime. The derivation of the kinetic
equation is based on an assumption of weak nonlinearity. Dominance of the
nonlocal interactions puts the self-consistency of the kinetic equation at
risk. Yet these weakly nonlinear stationary states are consistent with much of
the observational evidence.

transition point. The theorem applies to smooth, finite-range and confining
potentials V bounded below, describing systems confined in finite regions of
space with continuously varying coordinates. The relevant configuration space
submanifolds are both the level sets {\Sigma_v := V_N^{-1} (v)}_{v \in R} of
the potential function V_N and the configuration space submanifolds enclosed by
the \Sigma_{v} defined by {M_v := V_N^{-1} ((-\infty,v])}_{v \in R}, which are
labeled by the potential energy value v, and where N is the number of degrees

assumption of diffeomorphicity of the equipotential hypersurfaces {\Sigma_v}_{v

for \vb=v/N, the Helmoltz free energy is uniformly convergent in N to its

microscopic interaction potentials V_N(q), among N degrees of freedom, and the
associated family of configuration space submanifolds {M_v}_{v \in R}, with
M_v={q \in R^N | V_N(q) \leq v}. On the basis of an analytic relationship
between a suitably weighed sum of the Morse indexes of the manifolds {M_ v}_{v
\in R} and thermodynamic entropy, the Theorem states that any possible unbound
growth with N of one of the following derivatives of the configurational
entropy S^{(-)}(v)=(1/N) \log \int_{M_v} d^Nq, that is of |\partial^k
S^{(-)}(v)/\partial v^k|, for k=3,4, can be entailed only by the weighed sum of
Morse indexes.
  Since the unbound growth with N of one of these derivatives corresponds to
the occurrence of a first or of a second order phase transition, and since the
variation of the Morse indexes of a manifold is in one-to-one correspondence
with a change of its topology, the Main Theorem of the present paper states
that a phase transition necessarily stems from a topological transition in

$0<\delta<1$, these processes are even not semimartingales. The last time
before 1 when a Bessel process hits 0, called $g_{\mu}$, plays a key role in
our study: we characterize its conditional distribution and extend Paul
L\'{e}vy's arc sine law and a related result of Jeulin about the standard
Brownian Motion. We also introduce some remarkable families of martingales
related to the Bessel process, thus obtaining in some cases a one parameter
extension of some results of Az\'{e}ma and Yor in the Brownian setting:
martingales which have the same set of zeros as the Bessel process and which
satisfy the stopping theorem for $g_{\mu}$, a one parameter extension of
Az\'{e}ma's second martingale, etc. Throughout our study, the local time of the
Bessel process also plays a central role and we shall establish some of its
elementary properties.

light of this result it is natural, given a Kaehler surface, to investigate the
relation between area minimizers and complex curves. When the Kaehler surface
is a K3 surface this problem takes on a new character. A Ricci flat
(Calabi-Yau) metric on a K3 surface X is hyperkaehler in the sense that there
is a two-sphere of complex structures, called the hyperkaehler line, each of
which is compatible with the metric. A minimizer of area among surfaces
representing a homology class \alpha consists of a sum of branched immersed
surfaces and it is then reasonable to ask whether each surface in this
collection is holomorphic for some complex structure on the hyperkaehler line.
Though this is true for many homology classes and there is other evidence that
makes this pausible, in this paper we show that there is an integral homology
class \alpha and a hyperkaehler metric g such that no area minimizer of \alpha

polarized laser pulses to drive a source of fusion neutrons with sub-optical
cycle duration is discussed. A two-side irradiation of a thin foil deuterated
target produces two countermoving ion bunches, whose collision leads to an
ultrashort neutron burst. Using particle-in-cell simulations and analytical
modeling, it is evaluated that, for intensities of a few $10^{19} W cm^{-2}$,
more than $10^3$ neutrons per Joule may be produced within a time shorter than
one femtosecond. Another scheme based on a layered deuterium-tritium target is
outlined.

rotating cylinders are presented. The full, time dependent Navier-Stokes
equations are solved with a combination of a finite difference and a Galerkin
method. Annular gaps of radius ratio $\eta=0.5$ and of several heights are
simulated. They are closed by nonrotating lids that produce localized Ekman
vortices in their vicinity and that prevent axial phase propagation of spiral
vortices. Existence and spatio temporal properties of rotating defects, of
modulated Ekman vortices, and of the spiral vortex structures in the bulk are
elucidated in quantitative detail.

are kicked by a pulsed optical lattice, the periodicity of which implies that
quasi-momentum is conserved in the transport problem. We study and compare
experimentally and theoretically two resonant limits of the kicked rotor: in
the vicinity of the quantum resonances and in the semiclassical limit of
vanishing kicking period. It is found that for the same experimental
distribution of quasi-momenta, significant deviations from the kicked rotor
model are induced close to quantum resonance, while close to the classical
resonance (i.e. for small kicking period) the effect of the quasi-momentum
vanishes.

phenomena very unlike at a first look. The usual experimental fingerprint of
threshold system grounded phenomena is the presence of power laws. Experimental
evidence has been found, for example, in superconductor vortex avalanches, sand
piles, the brain, 4He superfluidity and earthquakes. Double power-laws have
been found in social networks, in the luminosity of some galactic nuclei and,
very recently, in solar flares, among others. Here we show evidences that point
to a threshold system as the source for magnetic storms detected on the Earth.
We based our analysis on series of data acquired during many years in the
network of magnetic observatories of the National Observatory (Brazil). In
particular we focused our attention on October 2000 month of the Vassouras
Observatory (RJ, Brazil), which have been active since 1915. We have found both
power laws and double power laws for some relevant distributions.

treats the ordinary phase space coordinates on the same footing and thereby
permits the definite the canonical momenta conjugate to these coordinates . The
extended lagrangian and extended hamiltonian are defined in EPS by the same
procedure as one does for ordinary lagrangian and hamiltonian. The combination
of ordinary phase space and their conjugate momenta exhibits the evolution of
particles and their mirror images together. The resultant evolution equation in
EPS for a damped harmonic oscillator, is such that the energy dissipated by the
actual oscillator is absorbed in the same rate by the image oscillator leaving
the whole system as a conservative system. We use the EPS formalism to obtain
the dual hamiltonian of a damped harmonic oscillator, first proposed by
Batemann, by a simple extended canonical transformations in the extended phase
space. The extended canonical transformations are capable of converting the
damped system of actual and image oscillators to an undamped one, and transform
the evolution equation into a simple form. The resultant equation is solved and
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for damped oscillator and its mirror image
are obtained. The results are in agreement with those obtained by Bateman. At
last, the uncertainty relation are examined for above system.

hydrinos, is investigated. We discuss both, the novel deterministic model of
the hydrogen atom, in which the existence of hydrinos was predicted, and
standard quantum mechanics. Severe inconsistencies in the deterministic model
are pointed out and the incompatibility of hydrino states with quantum
