of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane

implications of the variability of AGN mechanical luminosity L_m on

assume that l=ln(L_m/L_x) is a Gaussian process. Then L_m will be log-normally
distributed at fixed cooling luminosity L_x, and the variance in a measure of
L_m will increase with the time-resolution of the measure. We test the
consistency of these predictions with existing data. These tests hinge on the
power spectrum of l(t). Monitoring of Seyfert galaxies combined with estimates
of the duty cycle of quasars imply flicker noise spectra, similar to those of
microquasars. We combine a sample of sources in cooling flows that have
cavities with the assumption that the average mechanical luminosity of the AGN
equals L_x. Given that the mechanical luminosities are characterized by flicker
noise, we find that their spectral amplitudes lie between the estimated
amplitudes of quasars and the measured values for the radio luminosities of
microquasars. The model together with the observation that powerful radio
galaxies lie within a narrow range in optical luminosity, predicts the
luminosity function of radio galaxies, in agreement with observations.
Forthcoming radio surveys will test the prediction that the luminosity function
turns over at about the smallest luminosities so far probed. [Abridged]

simultaneously tidal forces, ram pressure and heating from ionizing radiation
fields. Tidally induced bar-buckling instabilities can transform a rotating
disky dwarf into a pressure supported spheroidal. Efficient gas removal
requires instead a combination of tidal mass loss and ram pressure stripping in
a diffuse gaseous corona around the primary system. The efficiency of ram
pressure depends strongly on how extended the gas remains during the evolution.
Bar driven inflows that tend to drive the gas to the bottom of the potential
well can be opposed by the heating from ultraviolet radiation. We show that
even fairly massive dwarfs ($V_{peak} >$ 30 km/s) would be stripped of their
gas over a few Gyr if they enter the Milky Way halo at $z > 2$ thanks to the
effect of the cosmic UV background. Gas mass loss can be much faster, occurring
in less than 1 Gyr, if dwarf satellites have their first close approach with
the primary at the epoch of bulge formation. Indeed at that time the primary

starbursts, resulting in a local radiation field even more intense than the

intergalactic medium (IGM) and clustering of the discrete ionizing sources.
While numerical simulations can in principle take both into account, they are
at present limited by small box sizes. On the other hand, analytic models have
only examined the limiting cases of a clumpy IGM (with uniform ionizing
emissivity) and clustered sources (embedded in a uniform IGM). Here, we present
an analytic model for the evolving topology of reionization that includes both
factors. At first, recombinations can be ignored and ionized bubbles grow
primarily through major mergers. As a result, reionization resembles
""punctuated equilibrium,"" with a series of well-separated sharp jumps in the
ionizing background. These features are local effects and do not reflect
similar jumps in the global ionized fraction. We then combine our bubble model
with a simple description of recombinations in the IGM. We show that the
bubbles stop growing when recombinations balance ionizations. If the IGM
density structure is similar to that at moderate redshifts, this limits the
bubble radii to ~20 comoving Mpc; however, it may be much smaller if the IGM is
significantly clumpier at higher redshifts. Once a bubble reaches saturation,
that region of the universe has for all intents and purposes entered the
""post-overlap"" stage, so the overlap epoch actually has a finite width. This
picture naturally explains the substantial large-scale variation in
Lyman-series opacity along the lines of sight to the known z>6 quasars. More
quasar spectra will shed light on the transition between the ""bubble-dominated""

No point source is observed in the remnant. We obtain a limiting flux of F_opt
< 1.6 x 10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 in the wavelength range 2900-9650 Angstroms for
any continuum emitter at the center of the supernova remnant (SNR). It is
likely that the SNR contains opaque dust that absorbs UV and optical emission,
resulting in an attenuation of ~35% due to dust absorption in the SNR. Taking
into account dust absorption in the remnant, we find a limit of L_opt < 8 x
10^{33} ergs/s. We compare this upper bound with empirical evidence from point
sources in other supernova remnants, and with theoretical models for possible
compact sources. Bright young pulsars such as Kes 75 or the Crab pulsar are
excluded by optical and X-ray limits on SN 1987A. Of the young pulsars known to
be associated with SNRs, those with ages < 5000 years are all too bright in
X-rays to be compatible with the limits on SN 1987A. Examining theoretical
models for accretion onto a compact object, we find that spherical accretion
onto a neutron star is firmly ruled out, and that spherical accretion onto a
black hole is possible only if there is a larger amount of dust absorption in
the remnant than predicted. In the case of thin-disk accretion, our flux limit
requires a small disk, no larger than 10^{10} cm, with an accretion rate no

unstable to hydrodynamic shear instabilities. The unstable eigenmodes have
properties well-matched to burst oscillations: low azimuthal wavenumber m, wave
speeds 1 or 2% below the equatorial spin rate, and e-folding times close to a

oscillations. Growth of shear instabilities may explain the brightness
asymmetry in the tail of X-ray bursts, although some fine tuning of the level

the emission measure distribution vs. temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma,
its abundances, and the electron density. The characteristic temperature and
density of the plasma suggest a corona similar to that of weak-line T Tauri
stars and active late-type main sequence stars. TWA 5 also shows a low iron
abundance (~0.1 times the solar photospheric one) and a pattern of increasing
abundances for elements with increasing first ionization potential reminiscent
of the inverse FIP effect observed in highly active stars. The especially high
ratio Ne/Fe~10 is similar to that of the classical T Tauri star TW Hya, where
the accreting material has been held responsible for the X-ray emission. We
discuss the possible role of an accretion process in this scenario. Since all T
Tauri stars in the TW Hydrae association studied so far have very high Ne/Fe
ratios, we also propose that environmental conditions may cause this effect.

standard deviation $J\sqrt{32/N}$, but only spins in different sublattices can
interact. The problem is formulated in a path integral formalism, where the
spin operators have been expressed as bilinear combinations of Grassmann
fields. The results of two fermionic models are compared. In the first one, the
diagonal $S^z$ operator has four states, where two eigenvalues vanish (4S
model), which are suppressed by a restriction in the two states 2S model. The
replica symmetry ansatz and the static approximation have been used to obtain
the free energy. The results are showing in phase diagrams $T/J$ ($T$ is the
temperature) {\it versus} $J_{0}/J$, $\Gamma/J$, and $H/J$. When $\Gamma$ is
increased, $T_{f}$ (transition temperature to a nonergodic phase) reduces and
the Neel temperature decreases towards a quantum critical point. The field $H$
always destroys $AF$; however, within a certain range, it favors the
frustration. Therefore, the presence of both fields, $\Gamma$ and $H$, produces
effects that are in competition. The critical temperatures are lower for the 4S
model and it is less sensitive to the magnetic couplings than the 2S model.

absolute limits to the stability of the fluid phase of the hard-sphere system,

theory describes fluids equally well as dilute gases or dense liquids, the
limits set upon the system stability by SPT must represent limits for the
existence of the fluid phase and transition to the solid. The reduced density
at the stability limits determined by SPT is shown to agree exactly with those
of that estimated for the Alder-Wainwright, supercritical, high-density

antiferromagnetism is found. The spins fluctuate on two energy scales, one a
damped spin response with a ~2 meV relaxation rate and the other a central mode
with a relaxation rate that slows to less than 0.08 meV below Tc. The spectrum
mirrors that of a soft mode driving a central mode. Extremely short correlation
lengths, 42+-5 Angstrom in-plane and 8+-2 Angstrom along the c direction, and
isotropic spin orientations for the central mode indicate that the correlations
are subcritical with respect to any second order transition to Neel order. The
dynamics follows a model where damped spin fluctuations are coupled to the slow
fluctuations of regions with correlations shortened by the hole doping.

large-scale quantum computers, because their low energy collective excitations
evolve reversibly, effectively isolated from the environment. The design of
reversible computers is constrained by the laws governing entropy flow within
the computer. In near-critical quantum circuits, entropy flows as a locally
conserved quantum current, obeying circuit laws analogous to the electric
circuit laws. The quantum entropy current is just the energy current divided by
the temperature. A quantum circuit made from a near-critical system (of
conventional type) is described by a relativistic 1+1 dimensional relativistic
quantum field theory on the circuit. The universal properties of the
energy-momentum tensor constrain the entropy flow characteristics of the
circuit components: the entropic conductivity of the quantum wires and the
entropic admittance of the quantum circuit junctions. For example,
near-critical quantum wires are always resistanceless inductors for entropy. A
universal formula is derived for the entropic conductivity:
\sigma_S(\omega)=iv^{2}S/\omega T, where \omega is the frequency, T the
temperature, S the equilibrium entropy density and v the velocity of `light'.
The thermal conductivity is Real(T\sigma_S(\omega))=\pi v^{2}S\delta(\omega).
The thermal Drude weight is, universally, v^{2}S. This gives a way to measure
the entropy density directly.

The entropic admittance of a near-critical junction in a bulk-critical circuit
is expressed in terms of commutators of the chiral entropy currents. The
entropic admittance at low frequency, divided by the frequency, gives the
change of the junction entropy with temperature -- the entropic `capacitance'.

calculated explicitly for junctions in bulk-critical quantum Ising circuits
(free fermions, massless in the bulk), in terms of the reflection matrix of the

defects will exist. These defects are essential for understanding phase
transitions in low dimensional systems[1]. Excitingly in some unique condensed

This is the case of skyrmions in quantum Hall ferromagnets[2] and solitons in
polymers[3]. Orbital order present in several transitions metal compounds[4-6]
could give rise to topological defects. Here we argue that the topological
defects in orbital ordered half doped manganites are orbital solitons.
Surprisingly, these solitons carry a fractional charge of $\pm$e/2, and
whenever extra charge is added to the system an array of solitons is formed and
an incommensurate solitonic phase occurs. The striking experimental asymmetry
in the phase diagram as electrons or holes are added to half doped
manganites[7-12], is explained by the energy difference between positive and
negative charged solitons. Contrary to existent models that explain coexistence
between phases in manganites as an extrinsic effect[13-14], the presence of
inhomogeneities is naturally explained by the existence of solitonic phases.
The occurrence and relevance of orbital solitons might be a general phenomena
in strongly correlated systems.

  Volume 267, Issues 1-3, 5 October 2005, Pages 31-49",,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Numerical solutions of the standard electrokinetic model provide a basis for
interpreting a variety of electrokinetic phenomena involving `bare' colloids.
However, the model rests on the classical notion of a shear or slipping plane,
whose location is unknown when surfaces are coated with permeable polymer.
Consequently, an electrokinetic model for `soft', `hairy' or `fuzzy' colloids
has been developed, but until recently solutions were available only for
several restricted cases, most notably for particles with thin, uniform layers,
and without polarization and relaxation. Here we present numerically exact
solutions of the full model for a variety of soft colloids, including
PEG-coated liposomes, PEO-coated latices, human erythrocytes, and
polyelectrolyte micelles. Particular attention is given to linking the
thickness, density and permeability of the coatings, which are key parameters
in the model, to ``physical'' quantities, such as the polymer molecular weight,
adsorbed amount, and hydrodynamic layer thickness. This paper also identifies
limits--on the ionic strength, particle size, layer thickness and
permeability--beyond which earlier theories breakdown. In short, polarization
and relaxation are as influential on the mobility of soft colloids as they are
for `bare' particles.

phenomenon of capillary condensation (CC) of Ar at the triple temperature
inside infinitely long, cylindrical pores. Pores of radius R= 1 nm, 1.7 nm and
2.5 nm have been investigated, using a gas-surface interaction potential
parameterized by the well-depth D of the gas on a planar surface made of the
same material as that comprising the porous host. For strongly attractive
situations, i.e., large D, one or more (depending on R) Ar layers adsorb
successively before liquid fills the pore. For very small values of D, in
contrast, negligible adsorption occurs at any pressure P below saturated vapor
pressure P0; above saturation, there eventually occurs a threshold value of P
at which the coverage jumps from empty to full, nearly discontinuously.
Hysteresis is found to occur in the simulation data whenever abrupt CC occurs,
i.e. for R>= 1.7 nm, and for small D when R=1nm. Then, the pore-emptying branch
of the adsorption isotherm exhibits larger N than the pore-filling branch, as
is known from many experiments and simulation studies. The relation between CC
and wetting on planar surfaces is discussed in terms of a threshold value of D,
which is about one-half of the value found for the wetting threshold on a
planar surface. This finding is consistent with a simple thermodynamic model of
the wetting transition developed previously.

  February 2005","cs.IT math.IT",,"  We consider a variation of the Wyner-Ziv problem pertaining to lossy
compression of individual sequences using finite-state encoders and decoders.
There are two main results in this paper. The first characterizes the
relationship between the performance of the best $M$-state encoder-decoder pair
to that of the best block code of size $\ell$ for every input sequence, and
shows that the loss of the latter relative to the former (in terms of both rate
and distortion) never exceeds the order of $(\log M)/\ell$, independently of
the input sequence. Thus, in the limit of large $M$, the best rate-distortion
performance of every infinite source sequence can be approached universally by
a sequence of block codes (which are also implementable by finite-state
machines). While this result assumes an asymptotic regime where the number of
states is fixed, and only the length $n$ of the input sequence grows without
bound, we then consider the case where the number of states $M=M_n$ is allowed
to grow concurrently with $n$. Our second result is then about the critical
growth rate of $M_n$ such that the rate-distortion performance of $M_n$-state
encoder-decoder pairs can still be matched by a universal code. We show that
this critical growth rate of $M_n$ is linear in $n$.

topics in theoretical physics. The earliest and most striking example of the
correspondence is the conjectured duality between the energy spectrum of type
IIB superstring theory on AdS_5 x S^5 and the operator anomalous dimensions of
N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. While there is a
substantial amount of evidence in support of this conjecture, direct tests have
been elusive. The difficulty of quantizing superstring theory in a curved
Ramond-Ramond background is compounded by the problem of computing anomalous
dimensions for non-BPS operators in the strongly coupled regime of the gauge
theory. The former problem can be circumvented to some extent by taking a
Penrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5, reducing the background to that of a pp-wave
(where the string theory is soluble). A corresponding limit of the gauge theory
was discovered by Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase, who obtained successful
agreement between a class of operator dimensions in this limit and
corresponding string energies in the Penrose limit. In this dissertation we
present a body of work based largely on the introduction of worldsheet
interaction corrections to the free pp-wave string theory by lifting the
Penrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5. This provides a new class of rigorous tests of
AdS/CFT that probe a truly quantum realm of the string theory. By studying the
correspondence in greater detail, we stand to learn not only about how the
duality is realized on a more microscopic level, but how Yang-Mills theories
behave at strong coupling. The methods presented here will hopefully contribute
to the realization of these important goals.

promote its use and understanding, we must first have a pragmatic understanding
of complexity and self-organization. This paper presents a conceptual framework
for speaking about self-organizing systems. The aim is to provide a methodology
useful for designing and controlling systems developed to solve complex
problems. First, practical notions of complexity and self-organization are
given. Then, starting from the agent metaphor, a conceptual framework is
presented. This provides formal ways of speaking about ""satisfaction"" of
elements and systems. The main premise of the methodology claims that reducing
the ""friction"" or ""interference"" of interactions between elements of a system
will result in a higher ""satisfaction"" of the system, i.e. better performance.
The methodology discusses different ways in which this can be achieved. A case
study on self-organizing traffic lights illustrates the ideas presented in the
paper.

(ESs) in a class of multi-wave systems with quadratic nonlinearity, families of
which seem to emerge from a critical point in the parameter space, where the
zero solution has a fourfold zero eigenvalue. In this paper, the existence of
such solutions is studied in a three-wave model. An appropriate rescaling casts
the system in a normal form, which is universal for models supporting ESs
through quadratic nonlinearities. The normal-form system contains a single
irreducible parameter $\epsilon $, and is tantamount to the basic model of
type-I second-harmonic generation. An analytical approximation of WKB type
yields an asymptotic formula for the distribution of discrete values of
$\epsilon $ at which the ESs exist. Comparison with numerical results shows
that the asymptotic formula yields an exact value of the scaling index, -6/5,
and a fairly good approximation for the numerical factor in front of the
scaling term.

tensor is well-defined, and the calculation of its components involves finite
summations only. We illustrate our approach by classifying broad classes of
conservative and Hamiltonian hydrodynamic chains with the zero Haantjes tensor.
We prove that the vanishing of the Haantjes tensor is a necessary condition for
a hydrodynamic chain to possess an infinity of semi-Hamiltonian hydrodynamic

relationships. The main difference to classical epidemic processes is the
strong nonlinear dependence of the transmission probability on the local

essential role in corruption dynamics. We discuss phase transitions, the
influence of the graph structure and the implications for epidemic control.
Structural and dynamical arguments are given why strongly hierarchically
organized societies like systems with dictatorial tendency are more vulnerable
to corruption than democracies. A similar type of modelling can be applied to
other social contagion spreading processes like opinion formation, doping

from a developed capital market does not lead to optimal results on the

number of weeks. An optimal system was that with 5 weeks. This trading system
has some of its characteristics comparable with the etalon trading system on

of a new optimal middle range trading system. Results of testing for liquid

failure stress produced in an elastic medium by a finite size rectangular fault
after its dislocation with uniform stress drop but a non uniform dislocation on
the source. The time-dependent rate of triggered earthquakes is estimated by a
rate-state model applied to a uniformly distributed population of faults whose
equilibrium is perturbated by a stress change caused only by the first
dislocation. The rate of triggered events in our simulations is exponentially
proportional to the stress change, but the time at which the maximum rate
begins to decrease is variable from fractions of hour for positive stress
changes of the order of some MPa, up to more than a year for smaller stress
changes. As a consequence, the final number of triggered events is proportional
to the stress change. The model predicts that the total number of events
triggered on a plane containing the fault is proportional to the 2/3 power of
the seismic moment. Indeed, the total number of aftershocks produced on the
fault plane scales in magnitude as 10^{M}. Including the negative contribution
of the stress drop inside the source, we observe that the number of events
inhibited on the fault is, at long term, nearly identical to the number of
those induced outside, representing a sort of conservative natural rule.
Considering its behaviour in time, our model doesn't completely match the
popular Omori law; in fact it has been shown that the seismicity induced
closely to the fault edges is intense but of short duration, while that
expected at large distances (up to some tens times the fault dimensions)
exhibits a much slower decay.

(PINs) is important for understanding the organisational and functional
principles of individual proteins. The number of interactions that a protein
has in a PIN has been observed to be correlated with its indispensability.
Essential proteins generally have more interactions than the non-essential
ones. We show here that the lethality associated with removal of a protein from
the yeast proteome correlates with different centrality measures of the nodes
in the PIN, such as the closeness of a protein to many other proteins, or the
number of pairs of proteins which need a specific protein as an intermediary in
their communications, or the participation of a protein in different protein
clusters in the PIN. These measures are significantly better than random
selection in identifying essential proteins in a PIN. Centrality measures based
on graph spectral properties of the network, in particular the subgraph
centrality, show the best performance in identifying essential proteins in the
yeast PIN. Subgraph centrality gives important structural information about the
role of individual proteins and permits the selection of possible targets for
rational drug discovery through the identification of essential proteins in the
PIN.

of cortical tissue, that complex arithmetical calculations can be carried out

shown to be positively correlated to the susceptibility of the network, defined
as its sensitivity to a variation of the mean of its inputs. For nontrivial

  A, Einstein Centenary Issue, August 2005",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A standard approach in the foundations of quantum mechanics studies local
realism and hidden variables models exclusively in terms of violations of
Bell-like inequalities. Thus quantum nonlocality is tied to the celebrated
no-go theorems, and these comprise a long list that includes the Kochen-Specker
and Bell theorems, as well as elegant refinements by Mermin, Peres, Hardy, GHZ,
and many others. Typically entanglement or carefully prepared multipartite
systems have been considered essential for violations of local realism and for
understanding quantum nonlocality. Here we show, to the contrary, that sharp
violations of local realism arise almost everywhere without entanglement. The
pivotal fact driving these violations is just the noncommutativity of quantum
observables. We demonstrate how violations of local realism occur for arbitrary
noncommuting projectors, and for arbitrary quantum pure states. Finally, we
point to elementary tests for local realism, using single particles and without
reference to entanglement, thus avoiding experimental loopholes and efficiency
issues that continue to bedevil the Bell inequality related tests.
