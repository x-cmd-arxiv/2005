of subhalos when they merge into their host halos. An improved algorithm is
used to identify the subhalos. We then examine their spatial and velocity
distributions in spherical and triaxial halo models. We find that the accretion
of satellites preferentially occurs along the major axis and perpendicular to
the spin axis of the host halo. Furthermore, the massive subhalos show a
stronger preference to be accreted along the major axis of the host halo than
the low-mass ones. Approximate fitting formulae are provided for the physical
properties of subhalos. Combined with analytical and semi-analytic techniques,
these empirical formulae provide a useful basis for studying the subsequent
evolution of subhalos and satellite galaxies in their hosts. Future studies
should however account for satellites that may not be undergoing the first
infall in their evolution.

and parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Three
physically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster
turbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce
microgauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major
mergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales
100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30
kpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,
turbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in
strength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,
smaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with
turbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.
The velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic
field scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a
small fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close
to unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the
coexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the
Perseus cluster. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically
100-200 rad/m^2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable
synchrotron polarization from cluster radio halos at wavelengths 3-6 cm, if
observed at sufficiently high resolution (abridged).

  26-29, 2004, Kiyosato, Japan",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The effect of pitch-angle anisotropy of fast electrons on generation of
nonthermal radio emission is studied. Incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation is
shown to depend strongly on the anisotropy. In particular, the spectral index
of gyrosynchrotron radiation increases up to a factor of 3-4 compared with the
isotropic case. The degree of polarization (X-mode) increases for loss-cone
distributions, while decreases for beam-like distributions. Ample evidence of
the pitch-angle anisotropy effect on (1) spatial distribution of the radio
brightness, (2) spatially resolved light curves of the intensity and
polarization, (3) spectral hardness of microwave bursts, is found by exploring
observations performed with Nobeyama Radioheliograph and Owens Valley Solar
Array. Above some threshold in the angular gradient, the electron cyclotron
maser instability (coherent gyrosynchrotron emission) can develop, provided
that standard gyrosynchrotron emission is accompanied by a lower-frequency
intense coherent emission. The coherent emission is studied in detail for a
realistic distribution of fast electrons over the energy and pitch-angle. In
agreement with observations of narrowband radio spikes, it is found that (1)
hard (power-law) distributions over energy are preferable to produce the
coherent emission, (2) the threshold of the instability corresponds to quite an
anisotropic electron distribution, thus, the pitch-angle anisotropy derived
from the properties of the continuum gyrosynchrotron radiation will not
necessarily give rise to coherent emission (either enhanced isotropization
implied by quasilnear saturation of the instability).

semi-analytic model. We assume that DLA hosts are disk galaxies whose mass
function is generated by Press-Schechter formulism at redshift 3. Star
formation and chemical evolution undergo in the disc. We select modelled DLAs
according to their observational criterion by Monte Carlo simulation using
random line of sights and disk inclinations. The DLA ages are set to be 1 to 3
Gyr. By best-fitting the predicted metallicity distribution to the observed
ones, we get the effective yield for DLAs about $0.25Z_{\odot}$. On the basis
of this constrain, we further compared our model predictions with observations
at redshift 3 in the following items: number density; gas content; HI frequency
distribution; star formation rate density; relationship between metallicity and
HI column density. We found that the predicted number density at redshift 3
agree well with the observed value, but the gas content $\Omega_{DLA}$ is about
3 times larger than observed since our model predicts more DLA systems with
higher column density. The frequency distribution at higher HI column density
is quite consistent with observation while some difference exists at lower HI
end. The predicted star formation rate density contributed by DLAs is
consistent with the most recent observations. Meanwhile, the connection between
DLAs and Lyman Break galaxies(LBGs) is discussed by comparing their UV
luminosity functions which shows that the DLAs host galaxies are much fainter
than LBGs. However, there is a discrepancy between model prediction and
observation in the correlation between metallicity and HI column density for
DLAs. Further investigations are needed for the star formation mode at high
redshift environments.

order to determine the ""pulsation"" mass -M_p- of each individual variable. The
comparison with the ""evolutionary"" masses -M_(e,can)- given by canonical (no
convective core overshooting, no mass-loss) models of central He-burning
stellar structures reveals that the M_p/M_(e,can) ratio is correlated with the

discuss the effects of different input physics and/or assumptions on the

pulsational results can be interpreted in terms of mass-loss during or before
the Cepheid phase, whose amount increases as the Cepheid original mass
decreases. It vanishes around 13M_(sun) and increases up to about 20% at
4M_(sun).

demonstration of non vanishing neutrino masses and flavour mixing. The ultimate
goal is the understanding of the origin of these properties from new physics.
In this road, the last unknown mixing [Ue3] must be determined. If it is proved
to be non-zero, the possibility is open for Charge Conjugation-Parity (CP)
violation in the lepton sector. This will require precision experiments with a
very intense neutrino source. Here a novel method to create a monochromatic
neutrino beam, an old dream for neutrino physics, is proposed based on the
recent discovery of nuclei that decay fast through electron capture. Such
nuclei will generate a monochromatic directional neutrino beam when decaying at
high energy in a storage ring with long straight sections. We also show that
the capacity of such a facility to discover new physics is impressive, so that
fine tuning of the boosted neutrino energy allows precision measurements of the
oscillation parameters even for a [Ue3] mixing as small as 1 degree. We can
thus open a window to the discovery of CP violation in neutrino oscillations.

derive fractional quantum relationships between energy and frequency, momentum

an alternative modeling approach to the standard fractional derivatives, we
introduce the concept of the Hausdorff derivative underlying the Hausdorff
dimensions of metric spacetime. And in terms of the proposed hypotheses, the
Hausdorff derivative is used to derive a linear anomalous transport-diffusion
equation underlying anomalous diffusion process. Its Green's function solution
turns out to be a new type of stretched Gaussian distribution and is compared
with that from the Richardson's diffusion equation.
