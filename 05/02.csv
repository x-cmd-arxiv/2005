an effort to guide future measurements of both traditional stellar parameters
and seismic frequencies towards constraining the amount of core overshoot in
Procyon A and possibly other stars. Current observational measurements of
Procyon A when combined with traditional stellar modeling only place a large
upper limit on overshoot of alphaOV < 1.1. By carrying out a detailed pulsation
analysis, we further demonstrate, how p- and g-mode averaged spacings can be
used to gain better estimates of the core size. For both p- and g-modes, the
frequency spacings for models without overshoot are clearly separated from the
models with overshoot. In addition, measurements of the l=0 averaged small
p-mode spacings could be used to establish Procyon A's evolutionary stage. For
a fixed implementation of overshoot and under favorable circumstances, the
g-mode spacings can be used to determine the overshoot extent to an accuracy of
+-0.05 Hp. However, we stress that considerable confusion is added due to the
unknown treatment of the overshoot region. This ambiguity might be removed by
analyzing many different stars. A simple non-local convection theory developed
by Kuhfuss is implemented in our stellar evolution code and contrasted with the
traditional approaches. We show that this theory supports a moderate increase
of the amount of convective overshoot with stellar mass of Delta(alphaOV) =
+0.10 between 1.5 Msun and 15 Msun. This theory places an upper limit on
Procyon A's core overshoot extent of ~0.4 Hp which matches the limit imposed by
Roxburgh's integral criterion.

the trigonometric moments of phases, which can be concluded with a ``mean

These moments are also closely related to the Pearson's random walks. We apply

for the heating and acceleration of winds from rotating stars. Stellar rotation
causes magnetic field lines anchored at the surface to form a spiral pattern
and magneto-rotational winds can be driven. If the structure is a magnetically
dominated, fast MHD waves generated at the surface can propagate almost
radially outward and cross the field lines. The propagating waves undergo
collisionless damping owing to interactions with particles surfing on magnetic
mirrors that are formed by the waves themselves. The damping is especially
effective where the angle between the wave propagation and the field lines
becomes moderately large ($\sim 20$ to $80^{\circ}$). The angle tends naturally
to increase into this range because the field in magneto-rotational winds
develops an increasingly large azimuthal component. The dissipation of the wave
energy produces heating and acceleration of the outflow. We show using
specified wind structures that this damping process can be important in both
solar-type stars and massive stars that have moderately large rotation rates.
This mechanism can play a role in coronae of young solar-type stars which are
rapidly rotating and show X-ray luminosities much larger than the sun. The
mechanism could also be important for producing the extended X-ray emitting
regions inferred to exist in massive stars of spectral type middle B and later.

a redshift distribution consistent with photometric models, we deproject this

significantly larger $r_{0}$ and $b$ than previous studies at $z\sim4$. We
interpret this as evidence that the brightest LBGs have a larger bias than
fainter ones, indicating a strong luminosity dependence for the measured bias
of an LBG sample. Comparing this against recent results in the literature at
fainter (sub-$L_{*}$) limiting magnitudes, and with simple models describing
the relationship between LBGs and dark matter haloes, we discuss the
implications on the implied environments and nature of LBGs. It seems that the
brightest LBGs (in contrast with the majority sub-$L_{*}$ population), have
clustering properties, and host dark matter halo masses, that are consistent
with them being progenitors of the most massive galaxies today.

spectrum with global properties resembling those observed in M82 but with a
much higher luminosity. We show that the starburst region can be divided into
an outer zone, beyond a radius of about 2.1 kpc, with a gas temperature of
about 10^7 K and a central region with temperatures in the range (2-6) x 10^7
K. The gas in the outer region emits most of the observed Oviii Lyman-alpha
line and the gas in the inner region the emission lines of higher ionization
ions, including a strong Fexxv line. We also identify a small inner part, very
close to the active nuclei, with typical Seyfert 2 properties including a large
amount of photoionized gas producing a strong Fe K-alpha 6.4 keV line. The
combined abundance, temperature and emission measure analysis indicates super
solar Ne/O, Mg/O, Si/O, S/O and possibly also Fe/O. The analysis suggests
densities in the range of (0.07-0.28) x epsilon^(-1/2) cm^(-3) and a total
thermal gas mass of about 4 x 10^8 x epsilon^(1/2) solar masses, where epsilon
is the volume filling factor. We used a simple model to argue that a massive

a ratio of the MOND dynamical mass to the baryonic mass of $M_m/M_b=4.94\pm
0.50$ in the outer parts (i.e $r\sim 0.5$ ~ R$_{vir}$), in the concordance
cosmological model where the predicted asymptotic ratio, if any baryons are
present, is $7.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ (at $r\geq 0.3$ ~ R$_{vir}$). We confirm that
the MOND paradigm lowers the discrepancy between the binding mass and the
baryonic mass in clusters by a factor of $\sim 1.6$ at about half the virial
radius. However, at this radius about 80% of the mass is still missing, and as
pointed out by \citet{sanders03}, this necessitates a component of dark baryons
or neutrinos in the cluster core. Concerning the neutrino hypothesis,
application of the new data requires a minimum neutrino mass of $m_\nu>1.74\pm
0.34$ eV to fill this gap. The corresponding 2$\sigma$ lower limit of
$m_\nu>1.06$ eV is marginally inconsistent with the current constraints from
the cluster number counts, and from the CMB and large scale structure data.
MOND must invoke neutrinos to represent the main component that account for the
missing mass problem in clusters.

result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in eleven of the twelve starbursts
lacks the strong O-star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of
luminous clusters in the same galaxies. The difference in stellar features
dominating cluster and field spectra indicate that the field light originates
primarily from a different stellar population, and not from scattering of UV
photons leaking out of the massive clusters. We consider several scenarios to
understand the lack of observed O stars in the field, and their implications
for the origin of the field stellar population. If the field stellar
populations formed in situ, the field must either have an IMF which is steeper
than Salpeter (3.0-3.5) or a Salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30-50
solar masses. If star formation occurs primarily in star clusters, the field
could be composed of older, faded clusters, and/or a population which is coeval

allow us to explore the role of magnetic pressure in creating and collimating
the outflow as well as showing the creation of a central jet within the broader
outflow cavity. We show that currents flow along this jet and we observe its
collimation to be enhanced by the additional hoop stresses associated with the
generated toroidal field. Although at later times the jet column is observed to
go unstable, the jet retains its collimation. We also present simulations of

cooling function of the form $\Lambda \propto \rho^2T^\alpha$ are the main
subject of this work. The linear analysis originally presented by Chevalier &
Imamura, is thoroughfully reviewed for several values of the cooling index
$\alpha$ and higher overtone modes. Consistently with previous results, it is
shown that the spectrum of the linear operator consists in a series of modes
with increasing oscillation frequency. For each mode a critical value of the
cooling index, $\alpha_\textrm{c}$, can be defined so that modes with $\alpha <
\alpha_\textrm{c}$ are unstable, while modes with $\alpha > \alpha_\textrm{c}$
are stable. The perturbative analysis is complemented by several numerical
simulations to follow the time-dependent evolution of the system for different
values of $\alpha$. Particular attention is given to the comparison between
numerical and analytical results (during the early phases of the evolution) and
to the role played by different boundary conditions. It is shown that an
appropriate treatment of the lower boundary yields results that closely follow
the predicted linear behavior. During the nonlinear regime, the shock
oscillations saturate at a finite amplitude and tend to a quasi-periodic cycle.
The modes of oscillations during this phase do not necessarily coincide with
those predicted by linear theory, but may be accounted for by mode-mode
coupling.

incorporating the effects of activated events by using the concepts from the

instantons) which lead to the spatial reorganization of molecules in the region
where the instanton pops up. The instanton vertex added to the usual MCT
depicts the probability and consequences of such an event which can be derived
from the random first order transition theory. The vertex is proportional to
$exp(-A/s_{c})$ where $s_{c}$ is the configurational entropy. Close to the
glass transition temperature, $T_{g}$, since $s_{c}$ is diminishing, the
activated process slows beyond the time window and this eventually leads to an
arrest of the structural relaxation as expected for glasses. The combined
treatment describes the dynamic structure factor in deeply supercooled liquid

that the splitting originates in a Fano anti-resonance, which is caused by
having one quantum dot side-connected in relation to the current's path. This

to the RKKY proposal, which is here also addressed.

Contrary to the ordinary gravitational waves (zero mode), the flux of the
induced KK modes by the non-spherical part of the quadrupole moment vanishes at
infinity and only the spherical part contributes to the flux. Since the effect
of the KK modes appears in the linear order of the metric perturbations, the

become negative depending on the motion of the localized sources.

completely break full $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry to $ \mathcal{N} = 0 $
theory in Minkowski signature. Similar to the space-time noncommutativity, this
theory has higher derivative terms and becomes non-local theory. However this
non-locality is milder than the space-time noncommutative field theory. Due to
the nilpotent feature of the coupling constants, we find that there are only
finite number of Feynman diagrams that give noncommutative corrections at each
loop order.

in p+A reactions relative to p+p is a leading order in A^{1/3}/log(s) violation
of longitudinal boost invariance at high energies. In A+A reactions this leads
to a trapezoidal enhancement of the local rapidity density of produced gluons.
The local rapidity gradient is proportional to the local participant number
asymmetry, and leads to an effective rotation in the reaction plane. We propose
that three dimensional jet tomography, correlating the long range rapidity and
azimuthal dependences of the nuclear modification factor,
R_{AA}(\eta,\phi,p_\perp; b>0), can be used to look for this intrinsic
longitudinal boost violating structure of $A+A$ collisions to image the

dipole and elliptic azimuthal moments of R_{AA}, a significant high p_\perp
octupole moment is predicted away from midrapidity. The azimuthal angles of
maximal opacity and hence minima of R_{AA} are rotated away from the normal to

  welcomed",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.dis-nn physics.geo-ph",,"  The current work discusses how complex networks can be applied in order to
aid economical development and stability at several scales and contexts. The
following activities are involved: (a) compilation of several types of data
related to socioeconomic development; (b) representation of such data in terms
of multilayer interacting complex networks (cond-mat/0406369) registered
geographically; (c) application of traditional and new methods for complex
networks characterization and analysis. Such an approach allows the
identification of bottlenecks and deficits/surpluses, simulation of system
development under varying constraints and perturbations, as well as the
application of optimization methods in order to help identify the most
effective strategies leading to social and economic wealth and stability. In
addition to its practical implications, such an approach also emphasizes
several issues of substantial theoretical interest, including the integration
of networks of different natures, the interplay between the dynamics of
topological and node state evolution, the effects of geographical constraints,
community finding, as well as optimization issues. The discussed methodology is
particularly interesting for applications in developing countries because of
the greater potential for economic evolution in such nations. This manuscript
also includes a brief review of complex networks approaches to socioeconomics
modeling.

distribution for a toroidal model of a ionic channel, using the Perfect
Screening Theorem (PST). The ions are charged hard spheres, and are treated
using a variational Mean Spherical Approximation (VMSA) .
  Understanding ion channels is still a very open problem, because of the many
exquisite tuning details of real life channels. It is clear that the electric
field plays a major role in the channel behaviour, and for that reason there
has been a lot of work on simple models that are able to provide workable
theories. Recently a number of interesting papers have appeared that discuss
models in which the effect of the geometry, excluded volume and non-linear
behaviour is considered.
  We present here a 3D model of ionic channels which consists of a charged,
deformable torus with a circular or elliptical cross section, which can be flat
or vertical (close to a cylinder). Extensive comparisons to MC simulations were
performed.
  The new solution opens new possibilities, such as studying flexible pores,
and water phase transformations inside the pores using an approach similar to
that used on flat crystal surfaces .

matter and radiation can be unified. We know a particle propagates like a wave;
its motion is described by certain wave equations. At this point, it is not
clear what the wave function represents. Besides the statistical meaning
suggested by the Copenhagen interpretation, does the wave function represent
any physical motion? For photon, we know it is an electro-magnetic wave. But
what about particles with rest mass, such as an electron? To investigate the
physical nature of matter wave, we propose that: (1) Like the photon, a
particle is an excitation wave of a real physical field. (2) Different types of
particles are different excitation modes of the same field. Based on this
thinking, we show that the concept of quantum mechanics can be a natural
extension of classical mechanics. By critically analyzing the transition from
classical physics to quantum physics, we found a new physical meaning for the
quantum wave function. This work suggests that various quantum wave equations,
including the Klein-Gordon equation, the Dirac equation and the Schrodinger
equation, could have a common base relating to the Basic Wave Equation of the
matter wave. This work has some interesting implications. It suggests a
possible way to explain the origin of visible matters and dark matters in our
universe.

plasmas that their equilibrium state are specified by the non-Maxwellian (here
kappa) distribution. We believe that the extension is very important since most
of the space and some of laboratory plasmas are not in the Maxwellian
equilibrium. Although the linear theory of this issue has been known for the
decades but, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt in opening the gate to
the nonlinear world of plasma waves with the non-Maxwellian equilibrium. As an
example the ion-acoustic solitons are studied in this framework taking into
account the electron trapping in the trough of longitudinal field. It is shown,
as the most important result regarding to the non-Maxwillian equilibrium, that
there is the possibility for the ion-acoustic solitons to move subsonically.
The solitons velocity and their width are monotonically increasing functions of
spectral index ($\kappa$) and approach to the their Maxwellian values as
$\kappa \to \infty$.

investigate the evolved state of the chain at a given fixed time, and show that
the nearest neighbor entanglement in the chain exhibits a critical behavior
(which we call a dynamical phase transition), controlled by the initial value
of the transverse field. The character of the dynamical phase transition is
qualitatively different for short and long evolution times. We also find a
nonmonotonic behavior of entanglement with respect to the temperature of the
initial equilibrium state. Interestingly, the region of the initial field for
which we obtain a nonmonotonicity of entanglement (with respect to temperature)
is directly related to the position and character of the dynamical phase
transition in the model.

algorithms, of having a fixed point, i.e. monotonic convergence towards the
solution. Recently a fixed point quantum search algorithm has been discovered,
referred to as the Phase-$\pi/3$ search algorithm, which gets around this
limitation. While searching a database for a target state, this algorithm
reduces the error probability from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{2q+1}$ using $q$
oracle queries, which has since been proved to be asymptotically optimal. A
different algorithm is presented here, which has the same worst-case behavior
as the Phase-$\pi/3$ search algorithm but much better average-case behavior.
Furthermore the new algorithm gives $\epsilon^{2q+1}$ convergence for all
integral $q$, whereas the Phase-$\pi/3$ search algorithm requires $q$ to be
$(3^{n}-1)/2$ with $n$ a positive integer. In the new algorithm, the operations
are controlled by two ancilla qubits, and fixed point behavior is achieved by
irreversible measurement operations applied to these ancillas. It is an example
of how measurement can allow us to bypass some restrictions imposed by
unitarity on quantum computing.
