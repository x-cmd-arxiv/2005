surface brightness profile steepens sharply beyond a certain radius (3--5
inner-disk scale lengths). Here we present the radial brightness profiles of a
number of barred S0--Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer
profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term
these ""anti-truncations""; they are found in at least 25% of a larger sample of
barred S0--Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of anti-truncations. About
one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer isophotes which are
progressively rounder than the main disk isophotes, suggestive of a disk
embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone -- either the outer extent of the
bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather
sharp surface-brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential
profile and, crucially, outer isophotes which are not significantly rounder
than the main disk; in the Sab--Sb galaxies, the outer isophotes include
visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the
disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer
isophotes (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be
responsible for at least some of the disklike anti-truncations.

i.e. enhanced very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission without any
contemporaneous X-ray flaring activity, that have recently been observed in
TeV-blazars (e.g., 1ES 1959+650). In order to explain the orphan TeV flare of
1ES 1959+650 observed in June 2002, the co-called hadronic synchrotron mirror
model has been developed. Here, relativistic protons are proposed to exist in
the jet, and interact with reflected electron-synchrotron radiation of the
precursor SSC flare. If the reflector is located in the cloud region, time
shifts of several days are possible between the precursor and the orphan flare.
The external photons, blueshifted in the comoving jet frame, are able to excite
the \Delta(1232)-resonance when interacting with protons of Lorentz factors
\gamma'_p~10^3-10^4. The decay products of this resonance include charged pions
which, upon decay, give rise to neutrino production during the orphan flare. In
this paper we calculate the expected neutrino emission for the June 4, 2002,
orphan TeV flare of 1ES 1959+650. We compare our results with the recent
observations of AMANDA-II of a neutrino event in spatial and temporal
coincidence with the orphan flare of this blazar. We find that the expected
neutrino signal from the hadronic synchrotron mirror model is insufficient to
explain the observed neutrino event from the direction of 1ES 1959+650.

combined action of disk torques and planet-planet scattering. The torques
exerted on planets during Type II migration in circumstellar disks readily
decrease the semi-major axes, whereas scattering between planets increases the
orbital eccentricities. This paper presents a parametric exploration of the
possible parameter space for this migration scenario using two (initial)
planetary mass distributions and a range of values for the time scale of
eccentricity damping (due to the disk). For each class of systems, many
realizations of the simulations are performed in order to determine the
distributions of the resulting orbital elements of the surviving planets; this
paper presents the results of 8500 numerical experiments. Our goal is to study
the physics of this particular migration mechanism and to test it against
observations of extrasolar planets. The action of disk torques and
planet-planet scattering results in a distribution of final orbital elements
that fills the a-e plane, in rough agreement with the orbital elements of
observed extrasolar planets. In addition to specifying the orbital elements, we
characterize this migration mechanism by finding the percentages of ejected and
accreted planets, the number of collisions, the dependence of outcomes on
planetary masses, the time spent in 2:1 and 3:1 resonances, and the effects of
the planetary IMF. We also determine the distribution of inclination angles of
surviving planets and the distribution of ejection speeds for exiled planets.

importance of Kozai-type oscillations in its orbital elements. In the context
of the tidal orbital evolution model, these variations require average
pericenter distances much higher than previously published, and the timescale
for the tidal orbital evolution of Triton becomes longer than the age of the
Solar System. Recently-discovered irregular satellites present a new constraint
on Triton's orbital history. Our numerical integrations of test particles
indicate a timescale for Triton's orbital evolution to be less than $10^5$ yrs
for a reasonable number of distant satellites to survive Triton's passage. This
timescale is inconsistent with the exclusively tidal evolution (time scale of
$>10^8$ yrs), but consistent with the interestion with the debris from
satellite-satellite collisions. Any major regular satellites will quickly
collide among themselves after being perturbed by Triton, and the resulting
debris disk would eventually be swept up by Triton; given that the total mass
of the Uranian satellite system is 40% of that of Triton, large scale evolution
is possible. This scenario could have followed either collisional or the
recently-discussed three-body-interaction-based capture.

gravitational back-reaction of long wavelength (super-Hubble) scalar metric
fluctuations on the perturbations themselves is investigated for a large class
of inflationary models. Specifically, the equations describing the evolution of
long wavelength cosmological metric and matter perturbations in an inflationary
universe are solved to second order in both the amplitude of the perturbations
and in the slow roll expansion parameter. Assuming that the linear fluctuations
have random phases, we show that the fractional correction to the power
spectrum due to the leading infrared back-reaction terms does not change the
shape of the spectrum. The amplitude of the effect is suppressed by the product
of the inflationary slow-roll parameter and the amplitude of the linear power

the plausibly relevant regime in which the Landau band spacing of both protons
and electrons is much larger than kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T
is the temperature), but still much smaller than the Fermi energies. Focusing
on the direct Urca process, we find that the emissivity oscillates as a
function of density or magnetic field, peaking when the Fermi level of the
protons or electrons lies about 3kT above the bottom of any of their Landau
bands. The oscillation amplitude is comparable to the average emissivity when
the Landau band spacing mentioned above is roughly the geometric mean of kT and
the Fermi energy (excluding mass), i. e., at fields much weaker than required
to confine all particles to the lowest Landau band. Since the density and
magnetic field strength vary continuously inside the neutron star, there will
be alternating surfaces of high and low emissivity. Globally, these
oscillations tend to average out, making it unclear whether there will be any
observable effects.

the corresponding diagonal term and the potential from neutrino-matter forward

for this solution to exist deep in the supernova environment, where it could
affect the neutrino signal, heavy-element nucleosynthesis, and even the revival

appreciable flavor mixing for both neutrinos and antineutrinos. A similar

presented. Power spectra from long-baseline ROSAT data show a spin period of
12150s along with several system related frequency components. However, the
second harmonic of the spin period dominates power spectrum in the XMM data.
For the optical circular polarization, the dominant period corresponds to half
the spin period. The ROSAT data can be explained as due to accretion onto two
hot spots that are not anti-podal. The variations seen in the optical
polarization and the ASCA and XMM data suggest the presence of at least three
accretion foot prints on the white dwarf surface. Two spectral models, a
multi-temperature plasma and a photo-ionized plasma model, are used for
spectral study. The RXTE PCA data are used to constrain the white dwarf mass to
1.2$\pm$0.1 M_odot using the multi-temperature plasma model. A strong soft
X-ray excess (<0.8 keV) in the XMM MOS data is well modeled by a blackbody
component having a temperature of 80-90 eV. The plasma emission lines seen at
6.7 and 7.0 keV are well fitted using the multi-temperature plasma model,
however an additional Gaussian is needed for the 6.4 keV line. The
multi-temperature plasma model requires a homogeneous absorber fully covering
the source and a partial absorber covering 65% of the source. The photo-ionized
plasma model, with a range of Fe column densities, gives a slightly better
overall fit and fits all emission lines. The presence of a strong blackbody
component, a spin period of 12150s, modulation of the 6.4 keV line flux with
spin period, and a very hard X-ray component suggest that V1432 Aql is a polar
with X-ray spectral properties similar to that of a soft intermediate polar.

crucial importance of this disagreement which has cosmological, galactic and

pair of quasars separated by 6.5arcsec. Based on this finding, we revisit the
long-standing question of whether this quasar pair is a binary quasar or a
wide-separation lens. Previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465
and show broad absorption lines. No evidence for a lensing galaxy has been
found between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:
diffuse X-ray emission observed with Chandra, and an excess of faint galaxies
observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we show, via VLT spectroscopy,
that there is a spike in the redshift histogram of galaxies at z=0.77. We
estimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significance
to be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse X-ray emission as originating
from z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. The mass of the cluster, as
estimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or the
X-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with the
theoretical mass required for gravitational lensing. The positional offset
between the X-ray centroid and the expected location of the mass centroid is
about 40kpc, which is not too different from offsets observed in lower redshift
clusters. However, UM425 would be an unusual gravitational lens, by virtue of
the absence of a bright primary lensing galaxy. Unless the mass-to-light ratio
of the galaxy is at least 80 times larger than usual, the lensing hypothesis
requires that the galaxy group or cluster plays a uniquely important role in
producing the observed deflections.

is investigated. Special focus is placed on the differences of the two commonly
used versions of the spin parameter, namely lambda=J*E^1/2/(G*M^5/2) (Peebles
80) and lambda'=J/(sqrt(2)*M_vir*R_vir*V_vir) (Bullock et al. 01). Though the
distribution of the spin transfer rate defined as the ratio of the spin
parameters after and prior to a merger is similar to a high degree for both,
lambda and lambda', we find considerable differences in the time evolution:
while lambda' is roughly independent of redshift, lambda turns out to increase
significantly with decreasing redshift. This distinct behaviour arises from
small differences in the spin transfer during accretion events. The evolution
of the spin parameter is strongly coupled with the virial ratio
eta:=2*E_kin/|E_pot| of dark halos. Major mergers disturb halos and increase
both their virial ratio and spin parameter for 1-2 Gyrs. At high redshifts
(z=2-3) many halos are disturbed with an average virial ratio of eta = 1.3
which approaches unity until z=0. We find that the redshift evolution of the
spin parameters is dominated by the huge number of minor mergers rather than
the rare major merger events.

binarity of these objects. Artificial star experiments suggest that at most 50%

one finds that canonical Zero Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) models do reach
effective temperatures typical of observed hot HB stars. We also show that the

conditions have been statistically constrained to reproduce the density field
within a sphere of 110 Mpc around the Milky Way, as observed in the IRAS 1.2-Jy
all-sky redshift survey. As a result, the positions and masses of prominent
galaxy clusters and superclusters in our simulations coincide closely with
their real counterparts in the local universe. We present the results of two
different runs, one with adiabatic gas physics only, and one also including
cooling, star formation and feedback. By analysing the full-sky maps for the
thermal and kinetic SZ signals extracted from these simulations, we find that
for multipoles with l<100 the power spectrum is dominated by the prominent
local superclusters, and its amplitude at these scales is a factor of two
higher than that obtained from unconstrained simulations; at lower multipoles
(l<20) this factor can even reach one order of magnitude. We check the
influence of the SZ effect from local superclusters on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) power spectrum at small multipoles and find it negligible and
with no signs of quadrupole-octopole alignment. However, performing simulations
of the CMB radiation including the experimental noise at the frequencies which

magnetic fields on the evolution of CMB spectral distortions by considering the
contributions by spontaneous and stimulated emission and by absorption in the
computation of the photon and energy injection rates. These cyclotron emission
rates have been numerically compared with those of the relevant radiative
processes operating in the cosmic plasma, bremsstrahlung and double Compton
scattering, for realistic CMB distorted spectra at early and late epochs. For
reasonable magnetic field strengths we find that the cyclotron emission
contribution is much smaller than the bremsstrahlung and double Compton
contributions, because of their different frequency locations and the high
bremsstrahlung and double Compton efficiency to keep the long wavelength region
of the CMB spectrum close to a blackbody (at electron temperature) during the
formation of the spectral distortion. Differently from previous analyses, we
find that for a very large set of dissipation mechanisms the role of cyclotron
emission in the evolution of CMB spectral distortions is negligible and, in
particular, it cannot re-establish a blackbody spectrum after the generation of
a realistic early distortion. The constraints on the energy exchanges at
various cosmic times can be then derived, under quite general assumptions, by
considering only Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and double Compton, other
than, obviously, the considered dissipation process. Finally, upper limits to
the CMB polarization degree induced by cyclotron emission have been estimated.

bottlenecks that suppress the diffusion in energy space, and hence the rate of

spectra are dominated by a broad background of scattering that extends to 1 eV.
Below 200 K a shoulder in the reflectance appears and signals the onset of
scattering at 400 cm^-1. In this temperature range we also observe a peak in
the optical conductivity at 177 cm^-1. Below 59 K, the superconducting
transition temperature, the spectra change dramatically with the appearance of
the superconducting condensate. Its spectral weight is consistent, to within
experimental error, with the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham (FGT) sum rule. We also
compare our data with magnetic neutron scattering on samples from the same
source that show a strong resonance at 31 meV. We find that the scattering
rates can be modeled as the combined effect of the neutron resonance and a
bosonic background in the presence of a density of states with a pseudogap. The
model shows that the decreasing amplitude of the neutron resonance with
temperature is compensated for by an increasing of the bosonic background
yielding a net temperature independent scattering rate at high frequencies.

magnetization in thin layers of the ferromagnetic semiconductor Ga1-xMnxAs. For
this investigation we have purposely chosen Ga1-xMnxAs with a low Mn
concentration (x ~ 0.02), since in such specimens contributions of cubic and
uniaxial anisotropy parameters are comparable, allowing us to identify the role
of both types of anisotropy in the magnetic reversal process. As a first step
we have systematically mapped out the angular dependence of ferromagnetic
resonance in thin Ga1-xMnxAs layers, which is a highly effective tool for
obtaining the magnetic anisotropy parameters of the material. The process of
perpendicular magnetization reversal was then studied by magneto-transport
(i.e., Hall effect and planar Hall effect measurements). These measurements
enable us to observe coherent spin rotation and non-coherent spin switching
between the (100) and (010) planes. A model is proposed to explain the observed
multi-step spin switching. The agreement of the model with experiment indicates
that it can be reliably used for determining magnetic anisotropy parameters
from magneto-transport data. An interesting characteristic of perpendicular
magnetization reversal in Ga1-xMnxAs with low x is the appearance of a double
hysteresis loops in the magnetization data. This double-loop behavior can be
understood by generalizing the proposed model to include the processes of
domain nucleation and expansion.

are shown to be smoothly connected at the point of zero interaction strength,
implying that the \emph{Bethe-ansatz} can be used also for attractive

are compared to (i) Lieb and Liniger's thermodynamic limit solution and (ii)
the Tonks-Girardeau gas limit. It is found that the energy of the thermodynamic

between the Tonks-Girardeau gas limit and the solution for finite interaction

$N$ attractive bosons on an infinite line, provided the interaction is stronger

  paper","BMC Bioinformatics (2005) 6:231",,,"cs.LG cs.DS q-bio.QM",,"  Background: Baum-Welch training is an expectation-maximisation algorithm for
training the emission and transition probabilities of hidden Markov models in a
fully automated way.
  Methods and results: We introduce a linear space algorithm for Baum-Welch
training. For a hidden Markov model with M states, T free transition and E free
emission parameters, and an input sequence of length L, our new algorithm
requires O(M) memory and O(L M T_max (T + E)) time for one Baum-Welch
iteration, where T_max is the maximum number of states that any state is
connected to. The most memory efficient algorithm until now was the
checkpointing algorithm with O(log(L) M) memory and O(log(L) L M T_max) time
requirement. Our novel algorithm thus renders the memory requirement completely
independent of the length of the training sequences. More generally, for an
n-hidden Markov model and n input sequences of length L, the memory requirement
of O(log(L) L^(n-1) M) is reduced to O(L^(n-1) M) memory while the running time
is changed from O(log(L) L^n M T_max + L^n (T + E)) to O(L^n M T_max (T + E)).
  Conclusions: For the large class of hidden Markov models used for example in
gene prediction, whose number of states does not scale with the length of the
input sequence, our novel algorithm can thus be both faster and more
memory-efficient than any of the existing algorithms.

back-reaction (a crucial point), the presence of the metric perturbative modes
(as well as matter fields) as the environment (that is, to be integrated or
traced out) introduces a correction term that provides a bound to the Euclidean
action. So the improved wavefunction is normalizable. That is, decoherence
plays an essential role in the consistency of quantum gravity. In the
spontaneous creation of the universe, this improved wavefunction allows one to
compare the tunneling probabilities from absolute nothing (i.e., not even
classical spacetime) to various vacua (with different large spatial dimensions
and different low energy spectra) in the stringy cosmic landscape.

branchings are governed by Schur function series obtained from plethysms of the
Schur function $s_\pi \equiv {\{} \pi {\}}$ by the basic $M$ series of complete
symmetric functions and the $L =M^{-1}$ series of elementary symmetric
functions. Our main technical tool is that of Hopf algebras, and our main
result is the derivation of a coproduct for any Schur function series obtained
by plethysm from another such series. Therefrom one easily obtains $\pi

characters of these subgroups is established. Concrete examples and extensive
tabulations are displayed for $H_{1^3}$, $H_{21}$, and $H_{3}$, showing their
involved and nontrivial representation theory. The nature of the subgroups is
shown to be in general affine, and in some instances non reductive. We discuss
the complexity of the coproduct formula and give a graphical notation to cope
with it. We also discuss the way in which the group branching laws can be
reinterpreted as twisted structures deformed by highly nontrivial 2-cocycles.
The algebra of subgroup characters is identified as a cliffordization of the
algebra of symmetric functions for GL(n) formal characters. Modification rules
are beyond the scope of the present paper, but are briefly discussed.

the parameter space $P^{Q}$ of such maps, I considered the algebraic curves
corresponding to the parameters for which critical orbits are periodic, and I
called such curves left and right bones. Using quasiconformal surgery methods
and rigidity I showed that the bones are simple smooth arcs that join two
boundary points. I also analyzed in detail, using kneading theory, how the
combinatorics of the maps evolves along the bones. The behavior of the
topological entropy function of the polynomials in my family is closely related
to the structure of the bone-skeleton. The main conclusion of the paper is that
the entropy level-sets in the parameter space that was studied are connected.

(very difficult) localization problem in tight closure theory. In the present
paper, these notions are developed further and partially reworked. For
instance, although no analogue of a long exact sequence arises from a short
stably phantom exact sequence of complexes, we provide a method for recovering
the kind of information obtainable from such a long sequence. Also, we give
alternate characterizations of the notion of phantom depth, including one based
on Koszul homology which we use to show that with very mild conditions on a
finitely generated module $M$, any two maximal phantom $M$-regular sequences in
an ideal $I$ have the same length. In order to do so, we prove a ""Nakayama
lemma for tight closure"" which is of independent interest. We strengthen the
connection of phantom depth with minheight, we explore several analogues of
""associated prime"" in tight closure theory, and we discuss a connection with
the problem of when tight closure commutes with localization.

construct the random analogue of the well-known logistic process in the
branching process' framework. This density-dependence corresponds to
intraspecific competition pressure, which is ubiquitous in ecology, and
translates mathematically into a quadratic death rate. The logistic branching
process, or LB-process, can thus be seen as (the mass of) a fragmentation
process (corresponding to the branching mechanism) combined with constant
coagulation rate (the death rate is proportional to the number of possible
coalescing pairs). In the continuous state-space setting, the LB-process is a
time-changed (in Lamperti's fashion) Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process. We obtain
similar results for both constructions: when natural deaths do not occur, the
LB-process converges to a specified distribution; otherwise, it goes extinct
a.s. In the latter case, we provide the expectation and the Laplace transform
of the absorption time, as a functional of the solution of a Riccati
differential equation. We also show that the quadratic regulatory term allows
the LB-process to start at infinity, despite the fact that births occur
infinitely often as the initial state goes to \infty. This result can be viewed
as an extension of the pure-death process starting from infinity associated to
Kingman's coalescent, when some independent fragmentation is added.

von-Neumann algebras generated by the weak Markov process and a unique up to
isomorphism minimal dilated quantum dynamics of endomorphisms associated with

if and only if the adjoint Markov semigroup satisfies Kolmogorov property. As
an application of our general results we find a necessary and sufficient
condition for a translation invariant state on a quantum spin chain to be pure.
We also find a tower of type-II$_1$ factors canonically associated with the
canonical conditional expectation on a sub-factor of a type-II$_1$ factor. This

calculated using the Rayleigh-Gans theory. We find that the effect of the
snowflake geometry on the scattering may be described in terms of a single
universal function, which depends only on the overall shape of the aggregate
and not the geometry or size of the pristine ice crystals which compose the
flake. This function is well approximated by a simple analytic expression at
small sizes; for larger snowflakes we fit a curve to our numerical data. We
then demonstrate how this allows a characteristic snowflake radius to be
derived from dual-wavelength radar measurements without knowledge of the
pristine crystal size or habit, while at the same time showing that this detail
is crucial to using such data to estimate ice water content. We also show that
the `effective radius', characterising the ratio of particle volume to
projected area, cannot be inferred from dual-wavelength radar data for
aggregates. Finally, we consider the errors involved in approximating
snowflakes by `air-ice spheres', and show that for small enough aggregates the
predicted dual wavelength ratio typically agrees to within a few percent,
provided some care is taken in choosing the radius of the sphere and the
dielectric constant of the air-ice mixture; at larger sizes the radar becomes
more sensitive to particle shape, and the errors associated with the sphere
model are found to increase accordingly.

  contribution. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:cond-mat/0501002",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study social behaviour of agents on capital markets when these are
perturbed by small perturbations. We use the mean field method. Social
behaviour of agents on capital markets is described: volatility of the market,
aversion constant and equilibrium states are discussed. Relaxation behaviour of
agents on the capital market is studied. Equation of motion for the agent
average number is of the relaxation type. Development of the group of agents in
the states corresponding to minimum of the aim function is either linear either
exponentially damped. There exist characteristic volatility constants $ V_{c3}
$ and $ V_{c3} $. The constant b of verification of information contribution to
the aversion constant A and the $ A_{0} $ constant of aversion are
distinguishing three types of dependencies of the minimum of the aim function
on the expected volatility EV and on the expected returns E. Arbitrage trades
and group forces lead the group into the equilibrium state. Verification of
information intensity influences return back to the equilibrium state. The
linear in time damping to the equilibrium state is characterized with the
characteristic time $ T_{3}$ and $ T_{6} $, the exponential with a
characteristic time $ \tau $. Their dependence on the expected volatility, on
the expected profit and characteristics of agents is discussed.

  and Technology - The Five Senses, Alpbach, Tyrol, Austria, August 2007",,,,"physics.pop-ph",,"  Aesthetics, among other criteria, can be statistically examined in terms of
the complexity required for creating and decrypting a work of art. We propose
three laws of aesthetic complexity. According to the first law of aesthetic
complexity, too condensed encoding makes a decryption of a work of art
impossible and is perceived as chaotic by the untrained mind, whereas too
regular structures are perceived as monotonous, too orderly and not very
stimulating. Thus a necessary condition for an artistic form or design to
appear appealing is its complexity to lie within a bracket between monotony and
chaos. According to the second law of aesthetic complexity, due to human
predisposition, this bracket is invariably based on natural forms; with rather
limited plasticity. The third law of aesthetic complexity states that aesthetic
complexity trends are dominated by the available resources, and thus also by
cost and scarcity.

co-magnetometer. An optically pumped alkali-metal vapor is used to polarize the
noble gas atoms and detect their gyroscopic precession. Spin precession due to
magnetic fields as well as their gradients and transients can be cancelled in
this arrangement. The sensitivity is enhanced by using a high-density
alkali-metal vapor in a spin-exchange relaxation free (SERF) regime. With a
K-3He co-magnetometer we demonstrate rotation sensitivity of 5 10^(-7)
rad/sec/Hz^(1/2). The rotation signal can be increased by a factor of 10 using
21Ne due to its smaller magnetic moment and the fundamental rotation
sensitivity limit for a 21Ne gyroscope with a 10 cm^3 measurement volume is
about 2 10^(-10) rad/sec/Hz^(1/2).

consistency of concept and principle rather than conflict with experiment. In
this spirit, I would like to look at the journey from the classical to the
relativistic world as a simple and direct exercise first in recognition of
universal character of universal entities and then carrying out the
universalization. By this process not only the relativistic world follows most
naturally but I would like to conjecture that if Einstein were born in 1844 (or
had I been born in 1844 and had followed this line of thought as I do now!) it
would have in fact been predicted including existence of a wave with universal
constant velocity. That would have indeed been not only the greatest but most
amazing and remarkable feat of human thought.
  Beating further on the same track of principle and concept driven ideas, we
ponder over to see beyond Einstein, and ask the questions: in how many
dimensions does gravity live, how many basic forces are there in nature and
what are the basic building blocks of space-time?

coupled receptor (GPCR), embedded in its membrane and in contact with two
metallic electrodes through which an external voltage is applied. To this
purpose, recently, we have proposed a model based on a coarse graining
description, which describes the protein as a network of elementary impedances.
The network is built from the knowledge of the positions of the C-alpha atoms
of the amino acids, which represent the nodes of the network. Since the
elementary impedances are taken depending of the inter-nodes distance, the
conformational change of the receptor induced by the capture of the ligand
results in a variation of the network impedance. On the other hand, the
fluctuations of the atomic positions due to thermal motion imply an impedance
noise, whose level is crucial to the purpose of an electrical detection of the
ligand capture by the GPCR. Here, in particular, we address this issue by
presenting a computational study of the impedance noise due to thermal
fluctuations of the atomic positions within a rhodopsin molecule. In our model,
the C-alpha atoms are treated as independent, isotropic, harmonic oscillators,
with amplitude depending on the temperature and on the position within the
protein (alpha-helix or loop). The relative fluctuation of the impedance is
then calculated for different temperatures.

  Physics, dedicated to the memory of Henry Kandrup",,"10.1196/annals.1350.026","LA-UR-05-2905","quant-ph",,"  The relationship between chaos and quantum mechanics has been somewhat uneasy
-- even stormy, in the minds of some people. However, much of the confusion may
stem from inappropriate comparisons using formal analyses. In contrast, our
starting point here is that a complete dynamical description requires a full
understanding of the evolution of measured systems, necessary to explain actual
experimental results. This is of course true, both classically and quantum
mechanically. Because the evolution of the physical state is now conditioned on
measurement results, the dynamics of such systems is intrinsically nonlinear
even at the level of distribution functions. Due to this feature, the
physically more complete treatment reveals the existence of dynamical regimes
-- such as chaos -- that have no direct counterpart in the linear (unobserved)
case. Moreover, this treatment allows for understanding how an effective
classical behavior can result from the dynamics of an observed quantum system,
both at the level of trajectories as well as distribution functions. Finally,
we have the striking prediction that time-series from measured quantum systems
can be chaotic far from the classical regime, with Lyapunov exponents differing
from their classical values. These predictions can be tested in next-generation
experiments.

two parallel metallic mirrors. Our results may also be applied to the
plane-sphere geometry used in most experiments. The metallic mirrors are
described by the plasma model, with arbitrary values for the plasma wavelength,
the mirror separation and the roughness correlation length, with the roughness
amplitude remaining the smallest length scale for perturbation theory to hold.
  From the analysis of the intracavity field fluctuations, we obtain the
Casimir energy correction in terms of generalized reflection operators, which
account for diffraction and polarization coupling in the scattering by the
rough surfaces. We present simple analytical expressions for several limiting
cases, as well as numerical results that allow for a reliable calculation of
the roughness correction in real experiments. The correction is larger than the
result of the Proximity Force Approximation, which is obtained from our theory
as a limiting case (very smooth surfaces).

environment can produce entanglement in contrast to its commonly believed role
of destroying entanglement. In addition, the collective zero-mode eigen
solutions of the system are found to be free of decoherence against the
dissipation of the environment. These decoherence-free states may be useful in
quantum information and quantum computation.

some of these models have not been defined before. We ""almost separate"" the
models of simultaneous quantum message passing with shared entanglement and the
model of simultaneous quantum message passing with shared randomness. We define
a relation which can be efficiently exactly solved in the first model but
cannot be solved efficiently, either exactly or in 0-error setup in the second
model. In fact, our relation is exactly solvable even in a more restricted
model of simultaneous classical message passing with shared entanglement.
  As our second contribution we strengthen a result by Yao that a ""very short""
protocol from the model of simultaneous classical message passing with shared
randomness can be simulated in the model of simultaneous quantum message
passing: for a boolean function f, QII(f) \in exp(O(RIIp(f))) log n.
  We show a similar result for protocols from a (stronger) model of 1-way
classical message passing with shared randomness: QII(f) \in exp(O(RIp(f))) log
n.
  We demonstrate a problem whose efficient solution in the model of
simultaneous quantum message passing follows from our result but not from
Yao's.

monotonicity theorem for relative entropies many bounds on the classical
information extracted in a quantum measurement are obtained in a unified
manner. In particular, it is shown that such bounds can all be stated as
inequalities between mutual entropies. This approach based on channels gives
rise to a unified picture of known and new bounds on the classical information
(Holevo's, Shumacher-Westmoreland-Wootters', Hall's, Scutaru's bounds, a new
upper bound and a new lower one). Some examples clarify the mutual
relationships among the various bounds.
