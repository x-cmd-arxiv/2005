dependent on the nature of the dark energy component of the Universe. When the
dark energy equation of state parameter is taken as a free (but constant)

with sum m_nu < 0.65 eV (95% C.L.) in the standard model where the dark energy
is in the form of a cosmological constant. This has important consequences for
future experiments aimed at the direct measurement of neutrino masses. We also
discuss prospects for future cosmological measurements of neutrino masses.

of state of the dark energy, w=p/rho. At fixed linear theory power, increasing
w leads to an increase in non-linear power, with the effect increasing with k.
By k=10 h/Mpc, a model with w=-0.75 has ~12% more power than a standard
cosmological constant model (w=-1), while a model with w=-0.5 has ~33% extra
power (at z=0). The size of the effect increases with increasing dark energy

is insensitive to the power spectrum shape (the numbers above are for
Omega_m=0.281 and sigma_8=0.897). A code quantifying the non-linear effect of

kinds of numerical error cancel in a ratio. When precision calculations based
on numerical simulations are needed for many different models, efficiency may
be gained by breaking the problem into a calculation of the absolute prediction

one expects the polarization PA to be parallel to the radio axis, while in a
case in which light scatters predominantly in the polar regions, the H alpha
polarization PA should be perpendicular to the radio axis. In practice, these
correlations are difficult to establish because a Galactic interstellar
polarization contribution can introduce a significant uncertainty into the
polarization PA determination, even when the magnitude of interstellar
polarization is small. We show how such uncertainties may affect the analysis

has been observed at a multitude of interplanetary (IP) shocks by different
spacecraft. The efficiency of injection of the pick-up ion component differs
from that of the solar wind, and is expected to be strongly enhanced at highly
oblique and quasi-perpendicular shock events, in accord with inferences from
{\it in situ} observations. This paper explores theoretical modeling of the
phase space distributions of accelerated ions obtained by the Ulysses mission
for the Day 292, 1991 shock associated with a corotating interaction region,
encountered before Ulysses' fly-by of Jupiter. A Monte Carlo simulation is used
to model the acceleration process, adapting a technique that has been
successfully tested on earlier IP shocks possessing minimal pick-up ion
presence. Phase space distributions from the simulation technique for various
low mass ions are compared with SWICS and HI-SCALE data to deduce values of a
``turbulence parameter'' that controls the efficiency of injection, and the
degree of cross-field diffusion. Acceptable fits are obtained for the $H^+$ and
$He^+$ populations using standard prescriptions for the pick-up ion
distribution; $He^{++}$ spectral data was only fit well for scenarios very
close to the Bohm diffusion limit. It is also found that the simulation
successfully accounts for the observation of energetic protons farther upstream
of the forward shock than lower energy pick-up protons, using the same
turbulence parameter that is required to achieve reasonable spectral fits.

rotation velocity increase when the viscosity coefficient decreases. The gas
rotates with sub-Keplerian angular velocity with a factor less than unity which

between LSMO and STO layers is confirmed by the transmission electron

low-temperature AMR in LSMO/STO superlattices with thinner LSMO layers or
thicker STO layers implies that two bands of majority and minority character
contribute to the transport properties, leading to a reduced spin polarization.
Furthermore, the magnetization of superlattices follows the T3/2 law at low

increases, corresponding to a reduced exchange coupling. The results clearly

induce a connected subtree; a partial coloring (which assigns colors to some of
the vertices) is convex if it can be completed to a convex (total) coloring.
Convex coloring of trees arise in areas such as phylogenetics, linguistics,
etc. eg, a perfect phylogenetic tree is one in which the states of each
character induce a convex coloring of the tree. Research on perfect phylogeny
is usually focused on finding a tree so that few predetermined partial
colorings of its vertices are convex.
  When a coloring of a tree is not convex, it is desirable to know ""how far"" it
is from a convex one. In [19], a natural measure for this distance, called the
recoloring distance was defined: the minimal number of color changes at the
vertices needed to make the coloring convex. This can be viewed as minimizing
the number of ""exceptional vertices"" w.r.t. to a closest convex coloring. The
problem was proved to be NP-hard even for colored string.
  In this paper we continue the work of [19], and present a 2-approximation

radiate arbitrarily many soft gluons, and the evolution consists in the

additional enhancement rapidly increasing with nuclear charge $Z$, the EDM
enhancement can exceed two orders of magnitude. We discuss the nuclear

negativity. We show that the multiplicative negativity is bounded by a
constant, independent of n, for all bipartite divisions of the n+1 qubits, and

connections with classical mechanics are indirect. In this work I propose a new
and direct connection between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics where
the quantum mechanical propagator is derived from a variational principle. I
identify this variational principle as a generalized form of Hamilton's
principle. This proposed variational principle is unusual because the physical
system is allowed to have imperfect information, i.e., there is incomplete
knowledge of the physical state. Two distribution functionals over possible
generalized momentum paths a[p(t)] and generalized coordinates paths b[q(t)]
are defined. A generalized action is defined that corresponds to a contraction
of a[p(t)], b[q(t)], and a matrix of the action evaluated at all possible p and
q paths. Hamilton's principle is the extremization of the generalized action
over all possible distributions. The normalization of the two distributions
allows their values to be negative and they are shown to be the real and
imaginary parts of the complex amplitude. The amplitude in the Feynman path
integral is shown to be an optimal vector that extremizes the generalized
action. This formulation is also shown to be directly applicable to statistical
mechanics and I show how irreversible behavior and the micro-canonical ensemble
follows immediately.

two qubits are initially in Werner state or Werner-like state, and find that
thermal environment can make two qubits become stationary nonlocality. The
analytical relations among average thermal photon number of the environment,
entanglement and nonlocality of two qubits are given in details. It is shown
that the fraction of Bell singlet state plays a key role in the phenomenon that
the common thermal reservoir can enhance the entanglement of two qubits.
Moreover, we find that the collective decay of two qubits in a thermal
reservoir at zero-temperature can generate a stationary maximally entangled
mixed state if only the fraction of Bell singlet state in the initial state is
not smaller than 2/3. It provides us a feasible way to prepare the maximally
entangled mixed state in various physical systems such as the trapped ions,
quantum dots or Josephson Junctions. For the case in which two qutrits
collectively coupled with the thermal reservoir at zero-temperature, we find
that the collective decay can induce the entanglement of two qutrits initially
in the maximally mixed state. The collective decay of two qutrits can also
induce distillable entanglement from the initial conjectured negative partial
