modeling the hybrid PG 1159 type star Abell 43. We show that the standard
kappa-mechanism due to the ionization of C and O in the envelope of this H-rich
PG 1159 star is perfectly able to drive g-mode pulsations. Thus, contrary to a
recent suggestion, there is no need to invoke any new or exotic mechanism to
explain the pulsational instabilities observed in this particular star. Our
expected instability band for l = 1 modes extends in period from ~ 2604 s to ~
5529 s, which is consistent with the available photometric observations of
Abell 43. We also suggest that efforts to detect luminosity variations in its
sibling NGC 7094 be pursued.

observed. The intergalactic dust model is partially successful in explaining
the shape of the composite energy distribution, but must be discarded in the
end, as the amount of crystalline dust required is unreasonable and would imply
an improbable fine tuning among the dust formation processes. The alternative
intrinsic dust model requires a mixture of both cubic diamonds and Allende
nanodiamonds and provide a better fit of the UV break. The gas column densities
implied are of the order 10^{20} cm^{-2} assuming solar metallicity for carbon
and full depletion of carbon into dust. The absorption only occurs in the
ultraviolet and is totally negligible in the visible. The minimum dust mass
required is of the order ~ 0.003 r_{pc}^{2}M_o, where r_{pc} is the distance in
parsec between the dust screen and the continuum source. The intrinsic dust
model reproduces the flux {\it rise} observed around 660A in key quasar spectra

We adopt
three numbers from observations of the Milky Way disc, the local surface mass
density, the stellar scale length (of the assumedly exponential disc) and the
amplitude of the (assumedly flat) rotation curve, and physically, the (local)
dynamical Kennicutt star formation prescription, standard chemical evolution
equations assuming and a model for spectral evolution of stellar populations.
We can determine the detailed evolution of the model with only the addition of
standard cosmological scalings with time of the dimensional parameters. A
surprising wealth of detailed specifications follows from this prescription
including the gaseous infall rate as a function of radius and time, the
distribution of stellar ages and metallicities with time and radius, surface
brightness profiles at different wavelengths, colours etc. At the solar
neighbourhood stars start to form $\approx 10 Gyrs$ ago at an increasing rate
peaking 4 billion years ago and then slowly declining in good agreement with
observations. The mean age of long lived stars at the solar neighbourhood is
about $4 Gyrs$. The local surface density of the stars and gas are 35 and $15
M_{\odot}pc^{-2}$, respectively. The metallicity distribution of the stars at
the solar radius is narrow with a peak at $[Z/Z_{\odot}] = -0.1$.Both a
Salpeter IMF and a Chabrier IMF are consistent with observations. Comparisons
with the current and local fossil evidence provides support for the model which
can then be used to assess other local disc galaxies, the evolution of disc
galaxies in deep optical surveys and also for theoretical investigations such
as simulations of merging disc galaxies (abbreviated).

provides a unified description of the thermodynamic properties associated with
various types of systems, such as spin-crossover (SC) solids and Prussian blue

ample information not easily revealed by conductance measurements. Phase
measurements in relatively large quantum dots (QDs) recently demonstrated a
universal like phase evolution independent of dot size, shape, and occupancy.
Explicitly, in Coulomb blockaded QDs the transmission phase increased
monotonically by pi throughout each conductance peak, thereafter, in the
conductance valleys the phase returned sharply to its base value. Expected
mesoscopic features in the phase, related to spin degeneracy or to exchange
effects, were never observed. Presently, there is no satisfactory full
explanation for the observed phase universality. Unfortunately, the phase in a
few-electron QDs, where it can be better understood was never measured. Here we
report on such measurements on a small QD that occupy only 1-20 electrons. Such
dot was embedded in one arm of a two path electron interferometer, with an
electron counter near the dot. Unlike the repetitive behavior found in larger
dots we found now mesoscopic features for dot occupation of less than some 10
electrons. An unexpected feature in this regime is a clear observation of the
occupation of two different orbital states by the first two electrons -
contrary to the recent publications. As the occupation increased the phase
evolved and turned universal like for some 14 electrons and higher. The present
measurements allowed us to determine level occupancy and parity. More
importantly, they suggest that QDs go through a phase transition, from
mesoscopic to universal like behavior, as the occupancy increases. These
measurements help in singling out potential few theoretical models among the
many proposed.

two-dimensional system coupled to the ripplons at the bubble surface. The
electron-ripplon coupling, known to lead to polaronic effects, is shown to give
rise also to Cooper pairing. A Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian
arises from the analysis of the electron-ripplon interaction in the bubble, and
values of the coupling strength are obtained for different bubble
configurations. The BCS Hamiltonian on the sphere is analysed using the
Richardson method. We find that although the typical ripplon energies are
smaller than the splitting between electronic levels, a redistribution of the
electron density over the electronic levels is energetically favourable as
pairing correlations can be enhanced. The density of states of the system with
pairing correlations is derived. No gap is present, but the density of states
reveals a strong step-like increase at the pair-breaking energy. This feature
of the density of states should enable the unambiguous detection of the
proposed state with pairing correlations in the bubble, through either
capacitance spectroscopy or tunneling experiments, and allow to map out the
phase diagram of the electronic system in the bubble.

matrices and the achievable rates under ML decoding of binary linear block
codes transmitted over memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channels. The
lower bounds on the parity-check density are expressed in terms of the gap
between the channel capacity and the rate of the codes for which reliable
communication is achievable, and are valid for every sequence of binary linear
block codes. The bounds address the question, previously considered by Sason
and Urbanke, of how sparse can parity-check matrices of binary linear block
codes be as a function of the gap to capacity. The new upper bounds on the
achievable rates of binary linear block codes tighten previously reported
bounds by Burshtein et al., and therefore enable to obtain tighter upper bounds
on the thresholds of sequences of binary linear block codes under ML decoding.
The bounds are applied to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and the
improvement in their tightness is exemplified numerically.

black holes (BBHs) in their last dozen orbits, where post-Newtonian techniques
fail, is a quasistationary approximation introduced by Detweiler and being
pursued by Price and others. In this approximation the outgoing gravitational
waves at infinity and downgoing gravitational waves at the holes' horizons are
replaced by standing waves so as to guarantee that the spacetime has a helical
Killing vector field. Because the horizon generators will not, in general, be
tidally locked to the holes' orbital motion, the standing waves will destroy
the horizons, converting the black holes into naked singularities that resemble
black holes down to near the horizon radius. This paper uses a spherically
symmetric, scalar-field model problem to explore in detail the following BBH
issues: (i) The destruction of a horizon by the standing waves. (ii) The
accuracy with which the resulting naked singularity resembles a black hole.
(iii) The conversion of the standing-wave spacetime (with a destroyed horizon)
into a spacetime with downgoing waves by the addition of a ``radiation-reaction
field''. (iv) The accuracy with which the resulting downgoing waves agree with
the downgoing waves of a true black-hole spacetime (with horizon). The model
problem used to study these issues consists of a Schwarzschild black hole
endowed with spherical standing waves of a scalar field. It is found that the
spacetime metric of the singular, standing-wave spacetime, and its
radiation-reaction-field-constructed downgoing waves are quite close to those
for a Schwarzschild black hole with downgoing waves -- sufficiently close to
make the BBH quasistationary approximation look promising for
non-tidally-locked black holes.

the galactic-plane neutrino flux as a targeted astrophysical source, we found
that the galactic-plane tau neutrino flux dominates over the atmospheric tau

in principle be seen through tau neutrinos with energies greater than 10 GeV.

Carlo variance without increasing the simulation size. The use of the
antithetic principle in the Monte Carlo literature typically employs two strata
via antithetic quantile coupling. We demonstrate here that further
stratification, obtained by using k>2 (e.g., k=3-10) antithetically coupled
variates, can offer substantial additional gain in Monte Carlo efficiency, in
terms of both variance and bias. The reason for reduced bias is that
antithetically coupled chains can provide a more dispersed search of the state
space than multiple independent chains. The emerging area of perfect simulation
provides a perfect setting for implementing the k-process parallel antithetic
coupling for MCMC because, without antithetic coupling, this class of methods
delivers genuine independent draws. Furthermore, antithetic backward coupling
provides a very convenient theoretical tool for investigating antithetic
forward coupling. However, the generation of k>2 antithetic variates that are
negatively associated, that is, they preserve negative correlation under
monotone transformations, and extremely antithetic, that is, they are as
negatively correlated as possible, is more complicated compared to the case
with k=2. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for investigating
such issues. Among the generating methods that we compare, Latin hypercube
sampling and its iterative extension appear to be general-purpose choices,

the usefulness of continuous bimodal priors to model hypervariance parameters,

penalization. Several model selection strategies, some frequentist and some
Bayesian in nature, are developed and studied theoretically. We demonstrate the
importance of selective shrinkage for effective variable selection in terms of
risk misclassification, and show this is achieved using the posterior from a
rescaled spike and slab model. We also show how to verify a procedure's ability
to reduce model uncertainty in finite samples using a specialized forward

situation where the response variable is a scalar and the predictor is a random
function. A linear predictor is obtained by forming the scalar product of the
predictor function with a smooth parameter function, and the expected value of
the response is related to this linear predictor via a link function. If, in
addition, a variance function is specified, this leads to a functional
estimating equation which corresponds to maximizing a functional
quasi-likelihood. This general approach includes the special cases of the
functional linear model, as well as functional Poisson regression and
functional binomial regression. The latter leads to procedures for
classification and discrimination of stochastic processes and functional data.
We also consider the situation where the link and variance functions are
unknown and are estimated nonparametrically from the data, using a
semiparametric quasi-likelihood procedure. An essential step in our proposal is
dimension reduction by approximating the predictor processes with a truncated
Karhunen-Loeve expansion. We develop asymptotic inference for the proposed
class of generalized regression models. In the proposed asymptotic approach,
the truncation parameter increases with sample size, and a martingale central
limit theorem is applied to establish the resulting increasing dimension
asymptotics. We establish asymptotic normality for a properly scaled distance
between estimated and true functions that corresponds to a suitable L^2 metric
and is defined through a generalized covariance operator.

Our theory provides a unified framework for minimum aberration and further
extends the existing work in the area. More importantly, the theory offers a
systematic method that enables experimenters to derive their own aberration
criteria. Our general theory also brings together two seemingly separate
research areas: one on minimum aberration designs and the other on designs with
requirement sets. To facilitate the design construction, we develop a
complementary design theory for quite a general class of aberration criteria.
As an immediate application, we present some construction results on a weak

valid to leading order in chiral expansion. In the model of strong low-energy
bar-KN interactions at threshold (EPJA 21,11 (2004)) we revisit the
contribution of the Sigma(1750) resonance, which does not saturate the
low-energy theorem a^0_0 + 3 a^1_0 = 0, and replace it by the baryon background
with properties of an SU(3) octet. We calculate the S-wave scattering
amplitudes of K^-N and K^-d scattering at threshold. We calculate the energy
level displacements of the ground states of kaonic hydrogen and kaonic
deuterium. The result obtained for kaonic hydrogen agrees well with recent
experimental data by the DEAR Collaboration. We analyse the cross sections for
elastic and inelastic K^-p scattering for laboratory momenta of the incident
K^- meson from the domain 70 MeV/c < p_K < 150 MeV/c. The theoretical results
agree with the available experimental data within two standard deviations.

paper, we present quantum yield as a function of excitation wavelength between

In addition, we present a definitive map of the steady-state fluorescence as a
function of excitation and emission wavelengths, and significantly, a
three-dimensional map of the specific quantum yield: the fraction of photons
absorbed at each wavelength that are subsequently radiated at each emission
wavelength. This map contains clear features, which we attribute to certain
structural models, and shows that radiative emission and specific quantum yield
are negligible at emission wavelengths outside the range of 585 and 385 nm (2.2
and 3.2 eV), regardless of excitation wavelength. This information is important
in the context of understanding melanin biofunctionality, and the quantum
molecular biophysics therein.

small-scale statistics are uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity and
the mean rate of energy dissipation. Landau remarked that the local rate of
energy dissipation should fluctuate in space over large scales and hence should
affect small-scale statistics. Experimentally, we confirm the significance of
this large-scale fluctuation, which is comparable to the mean rate of energy
dissipation at the typical scale for energy-containing eddies. The significance
is independent of the Reynolds number and the configuration for turbulence
production. With an increase of scale r above the scale of largest
energy-containing eddies, the fluctuation becomes to have the scaling r^-1/2
and becomes close to Gaussian. We also confirm that the large-scale fluctuation
affects small-scale statistics.

  figures, to appear in J. Chem. Phys",,"10.1063/1.1948367",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The free energy profile of a reaction can be estimated in a
molecular-dynamics approach by imposing a mechanical constraint along a
reaction coordinate (RC). Many recent studies have shown that the temperature
can greatly influence the path followed by the reactants. Here, we propose a
practical way to construct the minimum energy path directly on the free energy
surface (FES) at a given temperature. First, we follow the blue-moon ensemble
method to derive the expression of the free energy gradient for a given RC.
These derivatives are then used to find the actual minimum energy reaction path
at finite temperature, in a way similar to the Intrinsic Reaction Path of Fukui
on the potential energy surface [K Fukui J. Phys. Chem. 74, 4161 (1970)]. Once
the path is know, one can calculate the free energy profile using thermodynamic
integration. We also show that the mass-metric correction cancels for many
types of constraints, making the procedure easy to use. Finally, the minimum
free energy path at 300 K for the addition of the 1,1'-dichlorocarbene to
ethylene is compared with a path based on a simple one-dimensional reaction
coordinate. A comparison is also given with the reaction path at 0 K.
