to the non-perturbative momentum distribution of the heavy quark in the meson.
We show that, despite this sensitivity, resummed perturbation theory has high
predictive power. Conventional Sudakov-resummed perturbation theory describing
the decay of an on-shell heavy quark yields a divergent expansion. Detailed
understanding of this divergence in terms of infrared renormalons has paved the
way for making quantitative predictions. In particular, the leading renormalon
ambiguity cancels out between the Sudakov factor and the quark pole mass. This
cancellation requires renormalon resummation but involves no non-perturbative
information. Additional effects due to the Fermi motion of the quark in the
meson can be systematically taken into account through power corrections, which
are only important near the physical endpoint. This way the moments of the
\bar{B}\to X(s) gamma spectrum with experimentally-accessible cuts - which had
been so far just parametrized - were recently computed by perturbative means.
At Moriond these predictions were confronted with new data from BaBar.

bosonization of a bi-fundamental free Dirac fermion defined on a noncommutative

Lechtenfeld et al. [Nucl. Phys. B705(2005)477] as the noncommutative
sine-Gordon for a {\sl pair} of scalar fields. The bosonic and fermionic
couplings are related by a strong-weak duality. We show that the couplings of
the both sectors for some representations satisfy similar relationships up to
relevant re-scalings, thus the NC bi-fundamental couplings are two times the

correlation time of the noise tend to zero and we obtain the limiting equations
under appropriate assumptions on the Gaussian noise. We show that the limiting
equation depends on the relative magnitude of the two fast time scales of the
system. In particular, we prove that in the case where the two relaxation times
converge to zero at the same rate there is a drift correction, in addition to
the limiting It\^{o} integral, which is not of Stratonovich type. If, on the
other hand, the colored noise is smooth on the scale of particle relaxation
then the drift correction is the standard Stratonovich correction. If the noise
is rough on this scale then there is no drift correction. Strong (i.e.

class of all symplectic 4--manifolds with prescribed fundamental group $G$
($\chi$ is the Euler characteristic, $\sigma$ is the signature, and $a,b\in
\BR$), focusing on the important cases $\chi$, $\chi+\sigma$ and
$2\chi+3\sigma$. In certain situations we can derive lower bounds for these
functions and describe symplectic 4-manifolds which are minimizers. We derive
an upper bound for the minimum of $\chi$ and $\chi+\sigma$ in terms of the
presentation of $G$.

taken from the GRV's next-to-leading order calculations on $F_2^p(x,Q^2)$ which
give very good fit to the available data in the $(x,Q^2)$-plane. It is shown
that the free neutron to proton structure functions ratio can be extracted from
corresponding EMC ratios for $^3He$ and $^3H$ mirror nuclei by using
self-consistent iteration procedure and the results are in good agreement with
other theoretical models as well as present available experimental data,

collision centrality are presented and the rescattering effect of $\phi$ mesons
in the hadronic phase is also investigated. The results show that experimental
measurement of $v_{2}$ for $\phi$ mesons can retain the early collision
information before $\phi$ decays and that the $\phi$ $v_2$ value obeys the
constituent quark number scaling which has been observed for other mesons and
baryons. Our study indicates that the $\phi$ $v_2$ mostly reflects partonic
level collectivity developed during the early stage of the nucleus-nucleus
collision and the strange and light up/down quarks have developed similar
angular anistropy properties at the hadronization.

deformation of the momentum and kinetic operators of quantum mechanics. Making
use of the factorization method, we construct classical versions of the
momentum and kinetic operators which, in addition to the standard quantum
expressions, contain terms that are functionals of the N-particle density. We
show that this implementation of the quantum-classical correspondence is
related to Witten's deformation of the exterior derivative and Laplacian,
introduced in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The
corresponding deformed action is also shown to be related to the Fisher
information. Finally, we briefly consider the possible relevance of our
approach to the construction of kinetic-energy density functionals.

  using and identifying only Bell states","Any suggestions, comments and helps are welcome!",,,,"quant-ph",,"  First, I show explicitly a scheme to {\it faithfully} and {\it
deterministically} teleport an arbitrary 2-qubit state from Alice to Bob. In
this scheme two same Bell states are sufficient for use. Bob can recover the
2-qubit state by performing at most 4 single-qubit unitary operations
conditioned on Alice's 4-bit classical public message corresponding to her two
Bell-state measurement outcomes. Then I generalize the 2-qubit teleportation
scheme to an aribitrary $N(N\ge 3)$-qubit state teleportation case by using $N$
same Bell states. In the generalized scheme, Alice only needs to identify $N$
Bell states after quantum swapping and then publish her measurement outcomes
($2N$-bit classical message). Conditioned on Alice's $2N$-bit classical
message, Bob only needs to perform at most $2N$ single-qubit unitary operations
to {\it fully} recover the arbitrary state. By comparing with the newest
relevant work [Phys. Rev. A{\bf 71}, 032303(2005)], the advantages of the
present schemes are revealed, respectively.
