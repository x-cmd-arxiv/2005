luminosity exceeds that of the central galaxy, satellite galaxies are
distributed as a power-law in luminosity. Combined with the halo mass function,
this description reproduces the observed characteristics of the galaxy LF,
including a shape consistent with the Schechter function. When all galaxies are
included, regardless of the environment or the Hubble type, the Schechter L* is
the luminosity scale above which the central galaxy luminosity-halo mass
relation flattens; L* corresponds to ~10^{13}Msun on the halo mass scale. In
surveys where central galaxies in massive clusters are neglected, either by
design or because of the cosmic variance, L* is simply the mean luminosity of
central galaxies in halos at the upper end of the selected mass range. The
smooth, exponential decay of the Schechter function toward high luminosities
reflects the intrinsic scatter in the central galaxy luminosity-halo mass

example we focus on a particular scenario [Chen (2003)] in which the black
holes form from quantum perturbations that were generated during hybrid

the range of initial PBH masses that would allow BHR's to comprise the dark

emission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have different physical
origins. In the framework of the standard fireball model, we discuss the X-ray
afterglow observed by the NFIs and its hard X-ray emission up to 60 keV several
hours after the burst, detected for about 20 ks by the PDS. Considering the
2-10 keV and optical light curves, the 0.1-60 keV spectrum during the 20 ks in
which the PDS signal was present and the 8.46 GHz upper limits, we find that
the multi-wavelength observations cannot be readily accommodated by basic
afterglow models. While the temporal and spectral behavior of the optical
afterglow is possibly explained by a synchrotron cooling frequency between the
optical and the X-ray energy band during the NFIs observations, in X-rays this
assumption only accounts for the slope of the 2-10 keV light curve, but not for
the flatness of the 0.1-60 keV spectrum. Including the contribution of Inverse
Compton (IC) scattering, we solve the problem of the flat X-ray spectrum and
justify the hard X-ray emission; we suggest that the lack of a significant
detection of 15-60 keV emission in the following 75 ks and last 70 ks spectra,
should be related to poorer statistics rather than to an important suppression
of IC contribution. However, considering also the radio band data, we find the
8.46 GHz upper limits violated. On the other hand, leaving unchanged the
emission mechanism requires modifying the hydrodynamics by invoking an ambient
medium whose density rises rapidly with radius and by having the shock losing
energy. Thus we are left with an open puzzle which requires further inspection.

mixing of the enriched material by turbulent motions and cloud collisions in

following the evolution of the gas density in the medium. Analytical
expressions were derived for the number of stars enriched by a given number of
supernovae, as well as for the amount of mass with which the ejected material
from a supernova is mixed before being locked up in a subsequently formed star.
It is shown that for reasonable values of the gas density (~0.1 cm-3) and of
the supernova rate (~0.25 kpc-3 Myr-1) of the Galactic halo, the resulting
metallicity distributions of the extreme Population II stars show a distinct
cut-off at [Fe/H] ~= -4. In fact, by assuming no low-mass Population III stars
were able to form out of the primordial interstellar medium, the derived
fraction of stars below [Fe/H] = -4 is in agreement with observations.
Moreover, the probability is high that even the most metal-poor stars observed
to date have been enriched by several contributing supernovae. This partly
explains the relatively small star-to-star scatter in many chemical-abundance
ratios for stars down to [Fe/H] = -4, as recently found in several
observational studies. Contribution from the thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae
is found to be negligible over almost the entire extremely metal-poor regime.

are potentially powerful standard sirens (the GW analog to standard candles)

observatory LISA will be able to measure the luminosity distance (but not the
redshift) to some distant massive BBH systems with 1-10% accuracy. This
accuracy is largely limited by pointing error: GW sources generally are poorly
localized on the sky. Localizing the binary independently (e.g., through
association with an electromagnetic counterpart) greatly reduces this
positional error. An electromagnetic counterpart may also allow determination
of the event's redshift. In this case, BBH coalescence would constitute an
extremely precise (better than 1%) standard candle visible to high redshift. In
practice, gravitational lensing degrades this precision, though the candle
remains precise enough to provide useful information about the
distance-redshift relation. Even if very rare, these GW standard sirens would
complement, and increase confidence in, other standard candles.

ratios. The resulting scatter in abundance ratios, e.g. as functions of the
overall metallicity, is demonstrated to be crucially dependent on the as yet
uncertain supernovae yields. The observed abundance ratios and their scatters
therefore have diagnostic power as regards the yields. The relatively small
star-to-star scatter observed in many chemical abundance ratios, e.g. by Cayrel
et al. (2004) for stars down to [Fe/H] = -4, is tentatively explained by the
averaging of a large number of contributing supernovae and by the cosmic
selection effects favoring contributions from supernovae in a certain mass
range for the most metal-poor stars. The scatter in observed abundances of
alpha-elements is understood in terms of observational errors only, while
additional spread in yields or sites of nucleosynthesis may affect the odd-even
elements Na and Al. For the iron-group elements we find systematically too high
predicted Cr/Fe and Cr/Mg ratios, as well as differences between the different
sets of yields, both in terms of predicted abundance ratios and scatter. The
semi-empirical yields recently suggested by Francois et al. (2004) are found to
lead to scatter in abundance ratios significantly greater than observed, when
applied in the inhomogeneous models. ""Spurs"", very narrow sequences in
abundance-ratio diagrams, may disclose a single-supernova origin of the
elements of the stars on the sequence. Verification of the existence of such
features, called single supernova sequences (SSSs), is challenging. This will
require samples of several hundred stars with abundance ratios observed to

Unfortunately, no other space mission has reached the long-term navigation
accuracy to yield an independent test of the effect. To fill this gap we

nondedicated concepts employing either a planetary exploration mission to the

mother spacecraft travelling to Saturn or Jupiter. The study analyses the
impact of a Pioneer anomaly test on the system and trajectory design for these

can discriminate between the most plausible classes of models of the anomaly, a
central force, a blueshift of the radio signal and a drag-like force. The
necessary adaptions of the system and mission design do not impair the
planetary exploration goals of the missions.

Using the Map-statistics, the aperture radius is typically several arcminutes,
hence the aperture often lies partly outside a data field, consequently the

effects analytically and by using mock catalogues. We find that the expected

comparable to the diameter of the aperture used. We finally report on the

renormalization-group framework: in the first part, I study the role of
symmetries and conservation laws in approximate solutions, while in the second
part I analyze Friedel oscillations and transport in Luttinger liquids with
impurities.
  The functional renormalization group (fRG) has been developed as a new
computational tool in the theory of interacting Fermi systems. The effective
behavior of a given microscopic model is calculated by solving coupled
differential flow equations for the Green functions with an energy scale as the
flow parameter. The symmetries of the microscopic model imply Ward identities
between Green and response functions. It is shown that solutions of truncated
flow-equation hierarchies satisfy Ward identities if the cutoff bare action is
gauge invariant. However, truncations are generally not self-consistent
approximations in the sense of Baym and Kadanoff.
  The fRG is then applied to study Luttinger liquids. By computing the full
spatial effective potential of a single impurity, long-range Friedel
oscillations are observed in the density profile with the expected power laws
for systems with up to 10^7 lattice sites. For a double barrier enclosing a dot
region we find temperature regimes in which the conductance follows power laws
with universal exponents, as well as non-universal crossover regimes in

For this purpose we apply a recursive method which allows us to organize
systematically the number of pairs of empty/doubly occupied sites and to
include infinitely many phonons which are induced by electronic tunneling. In
lowest order of the recursion (i.e. for all processes with only one pairs of

charge $Q$ immersed in a two-dimensional electrolyte with charges $+1/-1$. In
particular, we are interested in the behavior of the density profiles and
electric potential created by the charge and the electrolyte, and in the
determination of the renormalized charge which is obtained from the
long-distance asymptotics of the electric potential. In Samaj's previous work,
exact results for arbitrary coulombic coupling $\beta$ were obtained for a
system where all the charges are points, provided $\beta Q<2$ and $\beta < 2$.
Here, we first focus on the mean field situation which we believe describes
correctly the limit $\beta\to 0$ but $\beta Q$ large. In this limit we can
study the case when the guest charge is a hard disk and its charge is above the
collapse value $\beta Q>2$. We compare our results for the renormalized charge
with the exact predictions and we test on a solid ground some conjectures of
the previous study. Our study shows that the exact formulas obtained by Samaj
for the renormalized charge are not valid for $\beta Q>2$, contrary to a
hypothesis put forward by Samaj. We also determine the short-distance
asymptotics of the density profiles of the coions and counterions near the
guest charge, for arbitrary coulombic coupling. We show that the coion density
profile exhibit a change of behavior if the guest charge becomes large enough
($\beta Q\geq 2-\beta$). This is interpreted as a first step of the counterion
condensation (for large coulombic coupling), the second step taking place at
the usual Manning--Oosawa threshold $\beta Q=2$.

considerably. It also leads to the running of the spectral index. For modes
that are larger than our current horizon, the tensor spectral index is
positive. For a window of k values with amplitudes of the same order of the

spectral index is oscillatory about the standard Quantum Field theory result,
taking both positive and negative values. There is a hope that in the light of

coupled scalar condensate, and a strongly coupled fermion condensate. The
former suffers from a finetuning problem unless there are cancelations to
radiative corrections, while the latter presents potential discrepancies with
precision electroweak physics. Here we present a framework for electroweak
symmetry breaking which interpolates between these two paradigms, and mitigates
their faults. As in Little Higgs theories, the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu
Goldstone boson, potentially composite. The cutoff sensitivity of the one loop
top quark contribution to the effective potential is canceled by contributions
from additional vector-like quarks, and the cutoff can naturally be higher than
in the minimal Standard Model. Unlike the Little Higgs models, the cutoff
sensitivity from one loop gauge contributions is not canceled. However, such
gauge contributions are naturally small as long as the cutoff is below 6 TeV.
Precision electroweak corrections are suppressed relative to those of
Technicolor or generic Little Higgs theories. In some versions of the
intermediate scenario, the Higgs mass is computable in terms of the masses of
these additional fermions and the Nambu-Goldstone Boson decay constant. In
addition to the Higgs, new scalar and pseudoscalar particles are typically

CMC implements exactly the full DGLAP evolution of the parton distributions in
the hadron with respect to the logarithm of the energy scale. The algorithm of
the CMC is referred to as the non-Markovian type. The non-Markovian MC
algorithm is defined as the one in which the multiplicity of emissions is
chosen randomly as the first variable and not the last one, as in the Markovian
MC algorithms. The former case resembles that of the fixed-order matrix element
calculations. The CMC algorithm can serve as an alternative to the so-called
backward evolution Markovian algorithm of Sjostrand, which is used for
modelling the initial-state parton shower in modern QCD MC event generators. We
test practical feasibility and efficiency of our CMC implementation in a series
of numerical exercises, comparing its results with those from other MC and
non-MC programs, in a wide range of Q and x, down to the 0.1% precision level.
In particular, satisfactory numerical agreement is found with the results of

symmetry where all representations beyond SL(10) level $\ell=3$ are omitted. If
this conjecture is right, higher-level representations should especially
capture the dynamics of further M-theory degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, the
level by level determination of $E_{10}$ commutators which is necessary to
extend the model to higher levels is both an involved and toilsome task that
requires computer aid. In this work, some of the relevant problems are exposed
and algorithmic methods are developed which simplify key steps in the
determination of explicit $E_{10}$ commutators at higher levels. As an
application, we compute the commutator of the level-two six-form with itself.

introduced in a deterministic frame: through the computation of the so-called
2-microlocal frontier, it allows in particular to predict the evolution of
regularity under the action of (pseudo-) differential operators. In this work,
we develop a 2-microlocal analysis for the study of certain stochastic
processes. We show that moments of the increments allow, under fairly general

In the case of Gaussian processes, more precise results may be obtained: the
incremental covariance yields the almost sure value of the 2-microlocal

introduced by Goldreich and Sridhar [P. Goldreich and S. Sridhar, ApJ {\bf

  Interruptions","15 pages, 2 figures, 1 table",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  Pilot studies of structured treatment interruptions (STI) in HIV therapy have
shown that patients can maintain low viral loads whilst benefiting from reduced
treatment toxicity. However, a recent STI clinical trial reported a high degree
of virologic failure. Here we present a novel hypothesis that could explain
virologic failure to STI and provides new insights of great clinical relevance.
We analyze a classic mathematical model of HIV within-host viral dynamics and
find that nonlinear parametric resonance occurs when STI are added to the
model; resonance is observed as virologic failure. We use the model to simulate
clinical trial data and to calculate patient-specific resonant spectra. We gain
two important insights. Firstly, within an STI trial, we determine that
patients who begin with similar viral loads can be expected to show extremely
different virologic responses as a result of resonance. Thus, high
heterogeneity of patient response within a STI clinical trial is to be
expected. Secondly and more importantly, we determine that virologic failure is
not simply due to STI or patient characteristics; rather it is the result of a
complex dynamic interaction between STI and patient viral dynamics. Hence, our
analyses demonstrate that no universal regimen with periodic interruptions will
be effective for all patients. On the basis of our results, we suggest that
immunologic and virologic parameters should be used to design patient-specific
STI regimens.

single photon signals, but the sources used in typical practical realizations
emit weak coherent states instead. A weak coherent state may contain more than
one photon, which poses a potential security risk. QKD with weak coherent state
signals has nevertheless been proven to be secure, but only under the
assumption that the phase of each signal is random (and completely unknown to
the adversary). Since this assumption need not be fully justified in practice,
it is important to know whether phase randomization is really a requirement for
security rather than a convenient technical assumption that makes the security
proof easier. Here, we exhibit an explicit attack in which the eavesdropper
exploits knowledge of the phase of the signals, and show that this attack
allows the eavesdropper to learn every key bit in a parameter regime where a
protocol using phase-randomized signals is provably secure. Thus we demonstrate
that phase randomization really does enhance the security of QKD using weak
coherent states. This result highlights the importance of a careful

optimal clones and one optimal flipped qubit. By combining linear and
non-linear optical methods we experimentally implement a scheme that, after the
cloning transformation, restores the original input qubit in one of the output
channels, by using local measurements, classical communication and feedforward.
This significant teleportation-like method demonstrates how the information is
preserved during the cloning process. The realization of the reversion process
is expected to find useful applications in the field of modern multi-partite
quantum cryptography.

the sender Alice first uses a Controlled-Not operation on the particle in the
unknown quantum state and an ancillary particle which she wants to send to the
receiver Bob. Then she sends ancillary particle to Bob.
  When Alice is informed by Bob that the ancillary particle is received, she
performs a local measurement on the particle and sends Bob the outcome of the
local measurement via a classical channel. Depending on the outcome Bob can
restore the unknown quantum state, which Alice destroyed, on the ancillary
particle successfully. As an application of this method we propose a quantum
secure direct communication protocol.
