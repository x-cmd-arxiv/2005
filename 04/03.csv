for the cluster NGC 2548 (M 48). A complete membership analysis based on
astrometric and photometric criteria is applied. The photometric analysis of a
selected sample of stars yields a reddening value of E(b-y)=0.06\pm0.03, a
distance modulus of V_0-M_V=9.3\pm0.5 (725 pc) and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=
-0.24\pm0.27. Through isochrone fitting we find an age of log t = 8.6\pm0.1
(400 Myr). Our optical photometry and JHK from 2MASS are combined to derive
effective temperatures of cluster member stars. The effective temperature
distribution along the main sequence of the cluster shows several gaps. A test
to study the significance of these gaps in the main sequence of the HR diagram
has been applied. The method is also applied to several other open clusters
(Pleiades, Hyades, NGC 1817 and M 67) to construct a sequence of metallicities
and ages. The comparison of the results of each cluster gives four gaps with
high significance (one of them, centred at 4900 K, has not been previously
reported).

easy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of its
ingredients -- like the SFR, AMR, IMF, and geometry of Galaxy components. In a
previous paper (Groenewegen et al. 2002), the code was first applied to
describe the very deep star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we
briefly describe its initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts,
which are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components of
largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the changes in the
calibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the model
input data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: the relatively
shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages,
and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by Hipparcos, which contains a
somewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the
same model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all the
above-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS
(16<R<23) to the very shallow ones of Hipparcos (V<8). Significant deviations
are found just for fields close to the Galactic Center and Plane, and for a
single set of South Galactic Pole data. The TRILEGAL code is ready to use for
the variety of wide-angle surveys in the optical/infrared that will become

plateau, 12--16 days after the gamma-ray event. UBVRIK' multi-band imaging of
the afterglow ~12 days after the GRB reveals a blue spectral energy
distribution (SED). The SED is consistent with a power-law with a spectral
index of \beta=-0.63+/-0.16, but there is tentative evidence for deviations
away from a power-law. Unfortunately, a spectroscopic redshift has not been
secured for GRB020305. From the SED we impose a redshift upper limit of z ~<

discuss the possibilities for explaining the lightcurve, SED and host galaxy
properties for GRB 020305. The most natural interpretation of the lightcurve

determine the redshift of the GRB. The most favoured explanation is a low
redshift (z~0.2) SN, but a higher redshift (z>0.5) SN can not be excluded. We
also discuss less likely scenarios not based on SNe, like a burst occurring in

entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity suggests that the Immirzi parameter is a fixed
value whose magnitude is on the order of unity but larger than one. Since the
Kodama state has de-Sitter spacetime as its classical limit, to get the proper
radiation temperature, the Kodama state should be extended to incorporate a
more physical value for $\beta$. Thus, we present an extension of the Kodama
state for arbitrary values of the Immirzi parameter, $\beta$, that reduces to
the ordinary Chern-Simons state for the particular value $\beta=-i$. The state
for real values of $\beta$ is free of several of the outstanding problems that
cast doubts on the original Kodama state as a ground state for quantum general
relativity. We show that for real values of $\beta$, the state is invariant
under large gauge transformations, it is CPT invariant (but not CP invariant),
and it is expected to be delta-function normalizable with respect to the
kinematical inner product. To aid in the construction, we first present a
general method for solving the Hamiltonian constraint for imaginary values of
$\beta$ that allows one to use the simpler self-dual and anti-self-dual forms

interaction term of the form -\xi R \Phi^{2}, is investigated in the case of
RS-geometry [1]. We show that the zero mode for \xi=0, turns into a tachyon
mode, in the case of a nonzero negative value of \xi (\xi<0). As we see, the
existence of the tachyon mode destabilizes the \Phi=0 vacuum, against a new
stable vacuum with nonzero \Phi near the brane, and zero in the bulk. By using
this result, we can construct a simple model for the gauge field localization,
according to the philosophy of Dvali and Shifman (Higgs phase on the brane,
confinement in the bulk).

produce this result. The existence of such models offers a novel perspective on
the realization of extra dimensions in string theory. In this view, while the
geometrical picture provides a useful mean to classify string vacua, in the
phenomenologically viable cases there is no physical realization of extra
dimensions. The models under consideration correspond to Z2 X Z2 orbifolds of
six dimensional tori, plus additional identifications by internal shifts and
twists. The special property of the Z2 X Z2 orbifold is that it may act on the
compactified dimensions as real, rather than complex, dimensions. This property
enables an asymmetric projection on all six internal coordinates, which enables
the projection of all the untwisted Kaehler and complex structure moduli.

to be minimized in Hamilton's principle?
  Using elementary arguments, I map the problem of finding the path of a moving
particle connecting two points to that of finding the minimum potential energy
of a static string. The mapping implies that the configuration of a
non--stretchable string of variable tension corresponds to the spatial path
dictated by the Principle of Least Action; that of a stretchable string in
space-time is the one dictated by Hamilton's principle. This correspondence
provides the answer to the question above: while a downward force curves the
trajectory of a particle in the (x,t) plane downward, an upward force of the
same magnitude stretches the string to the same configuration x(t).

different shapes of the confidence range. In all cases, we find that the
thresholds for consensus and cluster merging either coincide with their
one-dimensional counterparts, or are very close to them. The symmetry of the
final opinion configuration, when more clusters survive, is determined by the
shape of the opinion space. If the latter is a square, which is the case we
consider, the clusters in general occupy the sites of a square lattice,
although we sometimes observe interesting deviations from this general pattern,
especially near the center of the opinion space.

point of view by four dynamical structure elements: potential function,
transverse matrix, degradation matrix, and stochastic force. These four
elements are balanced to determine the network dynamics, which gives arise to a
special stochastic differential equation supplemented by a relationship between
the stochastic force and the degradation matrix. Important network behaviors
can be obtained from the potential function without explicitly solving for the
time-dependent solution. The existence of such a potential function suggests a
global optimization principle, and the existence stochastic force corresponds
natural to the hierarchical structure in metabolic networks. We provide
theoretical evidences to justify our proposal by discussing its connections to
others large-scale biochemical systems approaches, such as the network
thermodynamics theory, biochemical systems theory, metabolic control analysis,
and flux balance analysis. Experimental data displaying stochasticity are also
pointed out.

nonlocal signalling. Such signalling provides an operational definition of
absolute simultaneity, which may naturally be associated with a preferred
foliation of classical spacetime. The argument applies to any deterministic
hidden-variables theory, and to both flat and curved spacetime backgrounds. We
include some critical discussion of Einstein's 1905 'operational' approach to
relativity, and compare it with that of Poincare.
