better than 1%. When we combine our results with our previous results between

1.6 < z < 3.2 as A*(1+z)^gamma, where A = 0.0062 and gamma = 2.75. We detect no
significant deviations from a smooth power law evolution over the redshift

The merger concentrates the gas content of the two galaxies into the nuclear
region. The gas that flows into the nuclear region refuels the central black
holes of the merging galaxies. We follow the refuelling of the black holes
during the merger semi-analytically.
  In the simulation presented in this article, the black holes grow from 3 x
10^7 to 1.8X 10^8 Solar masses, with a peak AGN luminosity of M_B ~ -23.7. We
study how the morphological and spectral properties of the system evolve during

host galaxies during the active phase. The peak of AGN activity coincides with
the merging of the two galactic nuclei and occurs at a stage when the remnant
looks like a lenticular galaxy. The simulation predicts the formation of a
circumnuclear starburst ring/dusty torus with an opening angle of 30-40 degrees
and made of clouds with n_H=10^24 cm^-2. The average optical depth of the torus
is quite high, but the obscuring medium is patchy, so that there still exist

difficult at optical to infrared wavelengths because of the strong foreground
radiation originating in the Solar System. Very high energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV)
gamma rays interact with EBL photons of these wavelengths through pair
production. In this work, the available VHE spectra from six blazars are used
to place upper limits on the EBL. These blazars have been detected over a range
of redshifts and a steepening of the spectral index is observed with increasing
source distance. This can be interpreted as absorption by the EBL. In general,
knowledge of the intrinsic source spectrum is necessary to determine the
density of the intervening EBL. Motivated by the observed spectral steepening
with redshift, upper limits on the EBL are derived by assuming that the
intrinsic spectra of the six blazars are $\propto E^{-1.8}$. Upper limits are
then placed on the EBL flux at discrete energies without assuming a specific
spectral shape for the EBL. This is an advantage over other methods since the
EBL spectrum is uncertain.

spheroids are byproducts of the feedback that regulates rapid black hole growth
in protogalaxies. We suggest that the feedback energy liberated by accretion
must pass through the accreting material, in an energy-conserving flux close-in
and a momentum-conserving flux further out. If the inflowing gas dominates the
gravitational potential outside the Bondi radius, feedback from
Eddington-limited accretion drives the density profile of the gas to that of a
singular isothermal sphere. We find that the velocity dispersion associated
with the isothermal potential, sigma, increases with time as the black hole
mass M grows, in such a way that M is proportional to sigma^4. The coefficient
of this proportionality depends on the radius at which the flow switches from
energy conserving to momentum conserving, and gives the observed M-sigma
relation if the transition occurs at ~100 Schwarzschild radii. We associate
this transition with radiative cooling and show that bremsstrahlung, strongly
boosted by inverse Compton scattering in a two-temperature (T_p >> T_e) plasma,
leads to a transition at the desired radius.
  According to this picture, bulge masses M_b are insensitive to the virial
masses of their dark matter haloes, but correlate linearly with black hole
mass. Our analytic model also explains the M_b-sigma (Faber-Jackson) relation
as a relic of black hole accretion. The model naturally explains why the
M-sigma relation has less scatter than either the M-M_b (Magorrian) or the
Faber-Jackson relation. It suggests that the M-sigma relation could extend down
to very low velocity dispersions, and predicts that the relation should not
evolve with redshift.

of 67 Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems with redshifts 1.7<zabs<3.7. For each
system, we measured average metallicities relative to Solar, [X/H] (with either
X=Zn, S or Si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, W1. We
find that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected at
the 5sigma significance level. The existence of such a correlation, over more
than two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be the
consequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxies
responsible for DLA absorption lines. The best-fit linear relation is
[X/H]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log W1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with W1 expressed in km/s. While
the slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same within
uncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,
there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation with
decreasing redshift. This suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend to
become more metal-rich with time. Moreover, the slope of this relation is
consistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.
The DLA systems having the lowest metallicities among the DLA population would
therefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. In
turn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the DLA galaxy
population. This may explain the recent result that the few DLA systems with
detected Ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.

reveals a ~2 sigma deviation from Keplerian motion in the projected rotation
curve of the high-velocity features, corresponding to a ~9 km/s, or 0.8%,
flattening of the LOS velocities with respect to Keplerian motion over the
range of the high-velocity masers. While there are a number of potential
explanations for this flattening, we argue for pure Keplerian rotation in an
inclination-warped disk based on the ability of this model to explain a number
of otherwise puzzling features of the system. A radial gradient in the disk
inclination of 0.034 mas^{-1} is not only consistent with the observed rotation
curve, but it generates a bowl along the near edge of the disk that naturally
explains the otherwise puzzling narrow spread in the declinations of the
systemic masers. It also explains the existence and location of an apparently
recurring flare amongst the systemic masers. There is no significant evidence
for non-Keplerian rotation in the inclination-warped disk. An additional
implication of the inclination warp is that the disk rises in front of and
obscures the central engine at a disk radius of about 8.3 mas, or 0.29 pc. By
comparing the observed X-ray column to conditions in the disk at this radius,
we argue that the molecular-to-atomic transition occurs just beyond the
outermost maser at 0.28 pc and from this we infer an accretion rate of
\~10^{-4}alpha M_sun/yr, consistent with the jet-dominated accretion models of
Yuan et al. (2002). Our model suggests that most of the observed X-ray column
arises in the warped accretion disk at 0.29 pc, and that the maser emission is
truncated at large radii predominantly as a result of the molecular-to-atomic
phase transition originally proposed by Neufeld & Maloney (1995).

bursts are produced by shocks in spherical fireballs or uniform jets of large
opening angles, there exists a standard decay form of the profile of pulses
arising from very narrow or suddenly dimming local (or intrinsic) pulses due to
the relativistic curvature effect (the Doppler effect over the spherical shell
surface). Profiles of pulses arising from other local pulses were previously
found to possess a reverse S-feature deviation from the standard decay form. We
show in this paper that, in addition to the standard decay form shown in Qin et
al. (2004), there exists a marginal decay curve associated with a local
$\delta$ function pulse with a mono-color radiation. We employ the sample of
Kocevski et al. (2003) to check this prediction and find that the phenomenon of
the reverse S-feature is common, when compared with both the standard decay
form and the marginal decay curve. We accordingly propose to take the marginal
decay curve (whose function is simple) as a criteria to check if an observed
pulse could be taken as a candidate suffered from the curvature effect. We
introduce two quantities $A_1$ and $A_2$ to describe the mentioned deviations
within and beyond the $FWHM$ position of the decay phase, respectively. The
values of $A_1$ and $A_2$ of pulses of the sample are calculated, and the
result suggests that for most of these pulses their corresponding local pulses
might contain a long decay time relative to the time scale of the curvature
effect.

stars by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a training set of high
quality data, and to fit the resulting light-curve templates to sparse and
noisy photometry to obtain parameters such as periods, mean magnitudes etc. The
PCA approach allows us to efficiently represent the multi-band light-curve
shapes of each variable, and hence quantitatively describe the average
behaviour of the sample as a smoothly varying function of period, and also the
range of variation around this average.
  In this paper we focus particularly on the utility of such methods for
analysing HST Cepheid photometry, and present simulations which illustrate the
advantages of our PCA template-fitting approach. These are: accurate parameter
determination, including light-curve shape information; simultaneous fitting to
multiple passbands; quantitative error analysis; objective rejection of
variables with non Cepheid-like light-curves or those with potential period
aliases.
  We also use PCA to confirm that Cepheid light-curve shapes are systematically
different (at the same period) between the Milky Way (MW) and the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC), and consider whether light-curve shape
might therefore be used to estimate the mean metallicities of Cepheid samples,
thus allowing metallicity corrections to be applied to derived distance
estimates.

a hotly debated issue: while it is clear that starbursts play a large role in
powering the IR luminosity in these galaxies, the relative importance of

understand the role of star forming gas in contributing to the infrared
luminosity in IR-bright galaxies. The J=3 level of 12CO lies 33K above ground
and has a critical density of ~1.5 X 10^4 cm^-3. The 12CO(J=3-2) line serves as
an effective tracer for warm-dense molecular gas heated by active star
formation. Here we report on 12CO (J=3-2) observations of 17 starburst spirals,
LIRGs and ULIRGs which we obtained with the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter

  Our main results are the following: 1. We find a nearly linear relation
between the infrared luminosity and warm-dense molecular gas such that the
infrared luminosity increases as the warm-dense molecular gas to the power
0.92; We interpret this to be roughly consistent with the recent results of Gao
& Solomon (2004a,b). 2. We find L_IR/M_H2 ratios ranging from ~10 to ~128
L_sun/M_sun using a standard CO-H2 conversion factor of 3 X 10^20 cm^-2 (K km
s^-1)^-1. If this conversion factor is ~an order of magnitude less, as
suggested in a recent statistical survey (Yao et al. 2003), then 2-3 of our

profiles of the two phases trace each other closely. Apart from very close to
the central AGN, line ratios in and between the phases vary only slowly with
position. The kinematics of the phases are indistinguishable and away from the
influence of the central AGN both the mean and dispersion in velocity are low

above indicates that the mechanisms for heating the molecular gas and ionizing
the HII regions are highly coupled. The highest surface brightness emission
within a few kpc of the central AGN is distinct, both kinematically and

it is heated by shocks originating from the interaction between the inflowing

energy problem. In broad terms, the old problem is related to an unexpected
order of magnitude of this component while the new problem is related to this
magnitude being of the same order of the matter energy density during the
present epoch of cosmic evolution. Current plans to measure the equation of
state certainly constitute an important approach; however, as we discuss, this
approach is faced with serious feasibility challenges and is limited in the
type of conclusive answers it could provide. Therefore, is it really too early
to seek actively for new tests and approaches to these problems? In view of the
difficulty of this endeavor, we argue here that a good place to start is by
questioning some of the assumptions underlying the formulation of these
problems and finding new ways to put this questioning to the test. First, we
calculate how much fine tuning the cosmic coincidence problem represents. Next,
we discuss the potential of some cosmological probes such as gravitational
lensing to identify novel tests to probe dark energy questions and assumptions.
Then, motivated by some theorems in General Relativity, we discuss if the full
identification of the cosmological constant with vacuum energy is
unquestionable. Also, we point out the relevance of experiments at the
interface of astrophysics and quantum field theory, such as the Casimir effect
in gravitational and cosmological contexts. We conclude that challenging some
of the assumptions underlying the cosmological constant problems and putting
them to the test may prove useful and necessary to make progress on these
questions. (Abridged)

the coefficients of the cluster expansion are connected to its Mobius function.
Because of this, it is rigorously proven that a unique such expansion exists
for any lattice model. The low-density analysis of the free-energy functional
motivates a redefinition of the basic clusters (zero-dimensional cavities)
which guarantees a correct zero-density limit of the pair and triplet direct
correlation functions. This new definition extends Rosenfeld's theory to
lattice model with any kind of short-range interaction (repulsive or
attractive, hard or soft, one- or multi-component...). Finally, a proof is
given that these functionals have a consistent dimensional reduction, i.e. the
functional for dimension d' can be obtained from that for dimension d (d'<d) if
the latter is evaluated at a density profile confined to a d'-dimensional
subset.

interval time series that is characterized by fractal and multifractal
properties that depend upon several biological and stress constraints. It has
been shown that: (i) the gait phenomenon is essentially a rhythmic cycle that
obeys particular phase symmetries in the synchronized movement of the limbs;
(ii) the fractal and multifractal nature of the stride interval fluctuations
become slightly more pronounced under faster or slower paced frequencies
relative to the normal paced frequency of a subject; (iii) the randomness of
the fluctuations increases if subjects are asked to synchronize their gait with
the frequency of a metronome or if the subjects are elderly or suffering from
neurodegenerative disease. Here we present a new model, called the super
central pattern generator, able to reproduce these known properties of walking

diagonal resistivity exhibits a ``metallic'' behavior. The Rxy(T) dependence
was found to be non-monotonic with a maximum at temperatures Tm~0.16Tf. The
Rxy(T) variations in the low-temperature domain (T<Tm) agree qualitatively with
the semiclassical model, that takes into account a broadening of the
Fermi-distribution solely. The semiclassical result considerably exceeds an
interaction-induced quantum correction. In the ``high-temperature'' domain

a semiclassical T-dependence of a transport time, or a thermal activation of

sufficiently asymmetric, there is a crossover line in the phase diagram such
that for thermodynamic states that lie on one side, the decay of the three bulk
pair correlation functions is oscillatory with a common wavelength
approximately equal to the diameter of the smaller spheres, and for states on
the other side, the common wavelength is approximately the diameter of the
bigger spheres. Using density functional theory we show that structural
crossover manifests itself in the intermediate range decay of i) the one-body
density profiles of a hard-sphere mixture adsorbed at planar walls, ii) the
effective (depletion) potential between two big hard-spheres immersed in the
same binary mixture and iii) the solvation force, or excess pressure, of the
same mixture confined between two planar hard-walls. We determine exactly the
structural crossover line for a one-dimensional binary mixture of hard-rods and
present evidence, based on density functional theory calculations and
Monte-Carlo simulations, for structural crossover in homogeneous binary
mixtures of hard-disks in two dimensions. By considering a multicomponent
mixture of hard-spheres, with an appropriate bimodal distribution of diameters,
we argue that structural crossover should still occur in the presence of
polydispersity and that our results could be relevant to colloidal mixtures
where correlation functions can be measured using real-space techniques.

with side information, showing that the capacity per unit energy is one nat per

by an expression similar to that for discrete time, and is evaluated for

In the case of a Gaussian momentum distribution, the potential is negative and

of small amplitude, remain unstable for arbitrary large amplitudes. We also
present an example of a momentum distribution which gives a negative quadratic

(alpha_{S}) of the singlet as ve^{-2(alpha_{S}-1)*pi*kR}. This suppression is
due to a small overlap between the profile of the singlet zero mode and the
triplet, which is confined to the TeV brane. The generic form for the neutrino
mass matrix due to the overlap between the fermions is not compatible with the
LMA solution. This is overcome by imposing a Z_{4} symmetry, which is softly
broken by couplings of the triplet Higgs to the lepton doublets. This model
successfully reproduces the observed masses and mixing angles in charged lepton
sector as well as in the neutrino sector, in addition to having a prediction of
|U_{e3}| ~ O(0.01). The mass of the triplet is of the order of a TeV, and could
be produced at upcoming collider experiments. The doubly charged member of the
triplet can decay into two same sign charged leptons yielding the whole triplet
coupling matrix which, in turn, gives the mixing matrix in the neutrino sector.

time--dependent compactification of classical supergravity on product spaces
that include one or more geometric twists along with non-trivial curved
internal spaces. With such effects, a scalar potential can have a local minimum
with positive vacuum energy. The existence of such a minimum generically
predicts a period of accelerated expansion in the four-dimensional
Einstein-conformal frame. Here we extend our knowledge of these cosmological
solutions by presenting new examples and discuss the properties of the
solutions in a more general setting. We also relate the known (asymptotic)
solutions for multi-scalar fields with exponential potentials to the
accelerating solutions arising from simple (or twisted) product spaces for
internal manifolds.

  String Modes","22 pages, 2 appendices, 2 EPS figs",,,,"hep-th astro-ph",,"  Finding a consistent way to stabilize the various moduli fields which
generically appear in string theory compactifications, is essential if string
theory is to make contact with the physics we see around us. We present, in
this paper, a mechanism to stabilize the dilaton within a framework that has
already proven itself capable of stabilizing the volume and shape moduli of
extra dimensions, namely string gas cosmology. Building on previous work, which
uncovered the special role played by massless F-string modes in stabilizing
extra dimensions once the dilaton has stabilized, we find that the string gas
cosmology of such modes also offers a consistent mechanism to stabilize the
dilaton itself, given the stabilization of the extra dimensions. We then
generalize the model to include D-string gases, and find that in the case of
bosonic string theory, it is possible to simultaneously stabilize all the
moduli we consider consistent with weak coupling. We find that our
stabilization mechanism is robust, phenomenologically consistent and evades
certain difficulties which might previously have seemed to generically plague
moduli stabilization mechanisms, without the need for any fine tuning.

superstar $\bigstar$-product combines the usual phase space $\ast$ star and the

present in this problem we show that the classical correspondent to the NC
Hamiltonian has the same form as the original Hamiltonian, but with a
non-commutativity parameter $\theta$-dependent, momentum-dependent shift in the

find that there exist qualitative differences between these two limits.
Specifically, if $\theta \neq 0$ there is no classical limit. Classical limit
exists only if $\theta \to 0$ at least as fast as $\hbar \to 0$, but this limit
does not yield Newtonian mechanics, unless the limit of $\theta/\hbar$ vanishes
as $\theta \to 0$. Another angle to address this issue is the existence of
conserved currents and the Noether's theorem in the continuity equation, and
the Ehrenfest theorem in the NCQM context.

conjecture entails certain predictions for which higher order corrections are
allowed: in particular corrections of type R^M (DF)^N are compatible with E10
only for M+N=3k+1. Furthermore, the leading parts of the R^4, R^7,... terms are
predicted to be associated with singlets under the SL(10) decomposition of E10.
Although singlets are extremely rare among the altogether 4,400,752,653

indeed singlets at levels l=10 and l =20 which do match with the R^4 and the

reductive G-subbundles of the linear frame bundle, such a decomposition defines
an infinitesimal canonical lift. This lift extends to a prolongation
Gamma-structure on P. In this general geometric framework the concept of a Lie
derivative of spinor fields is reviewed. On specializing to the case of the
Kosmann lift, we recover Kosmann's original definition. We also show that in
the case of a reductive G-structure one can introduce a ""reductive Lie
derivative"" with respect to a certain class of generalized infinitesimal
automorphisms, and, as an interesting by-product, prove a result due to
Bourguignon and Gauduchon in a more general manner. Next, we give a new
characterization as well as a generalization of the Killing equation, and
propose a geometric reinterpretation of Penrose's Lie derivative of ""spinor

compact support property for measure-valued processes corresponding to

shall investigate how the interplay between the underlying motion (the
diffusion process corresponding to $L$) and the branching affects the compact
support property. In \cite{EP99}, the compact support property was shown to be
equivalent to a certain analytic criterion concerning uniqueness of the Cauchy
problem for the semi-linear parabolic equation related to the measured valued
process. In a subsequent paper \cite{EP03}, this analytic property was
investigated purely from the point of view of partial differential equations.
Some of the results obtained in this latter paper yield interesting results
concerning the compact support property. In this paper, the results from
\cite{EP03} that are relevant to the compact support property are presented,
sometimes with extensions. These results are interwoven with new results and
some informal heuristics. Taken together, they yield a rather comprehensive
picture of the compact support property. \it Inter alia\rm, we show that the
concept of a measure-valued process \it hitting\rm a point can be investigated
via the compact support property, and suggest an alternate proof of a result

found to be inconsistent with the geometrical formulation of special

order to gauge the extent and nature of the use of relativistic mass a survey

self-contradicting use of this concept points to the lack of clear consensus on
the formulation of relativity. As geometry lies at the heart of all modern
representations of relativity, it is urged, once again, that the use of the
concept at all levels be abandoned.

discussed in the literature. Such a possibility can be useful in a variety of
optical and microwave applications. Many qualitatively different approaches
have been explored. Here we discuss how this goal can be achieved in linear
dispersive media, such as photonic crystals. The existence of slowly
propagating electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals is quite obvious and
well known. The main problem, though, has been how to convert the input
radiation into the slow mode without loosing a significant portion of the
incident light energy to absorption, reflection, etc. We show that the
so-called frozen mode regime offers a unique solution to the above problem.
Under the frozen mode regime, the incident light enters the photonic crystal
with little reflection and, subsequently, is completely converted into the
frozen mode with huge amplitude and almost zero group velocity. The linearity
of the above effect allows to slow light regardless of its intensity. An
additional advantage of photonic crystals over other methods of slowing down
light is that photonic crystals can preserve both time and space coherence of
the input electromagnetic wave.

able to self-organize to produce networks. Three major motifs, feedforward
loop, single input modules and bi-fan are found in gene regulatory networks.
The large ratio of genes to transcription factors (TFs) in genomes leads to a
sharing of TFs by motifs and is sufficient to result in network
self-organization. We find a common design principle of these motifs: short
transcript's half-life (THL) TFs are significantly enriched in motifs and hubs.
This enrichment becomes one of the driving forces for the emergence of the
network scale-free topology and allows the network to quickly adapt to
environmental changes. Most feedforward loops and bi-fans contain at least one
short THL TF, which can be seen as a criterion for self-assembling these
motifs. We have classified the motifs according to their short THL TF content.
We show that the percentage of the different motif subtypes varies in different
cellular conditions.

that Alice inputs a bit at her end of the device and that Bob does likewise, it

CHSH inequality, was first proposed by Popescu and Rohrlich to examine the
question: given that a maximally entangled pair of qubits is non-local, why is
it not maximally non-local? We believe that understanding the power of this box
will yield insight into the non-locality of quantum mechanics. It was shown
recently by Cerf, Gisin, Massar and Popescu, that this imaginary device is able
to simulate correlations from any measurement on a singlet state. Here, we show
that the non-local box can in fact do much more: through the simulation of the
magic square pseudo-telepathy game and the Mermin-GHZ pseudo-telepathy game, we
show that the non-local box can simulate quantum correlations that no entangled
pair of qubits can in a bipartite scenario and even in a multi-party scenario.
Finally we show that a single non-local box cannot simulate all quantum
correlations and propose a generalization for a multi-party non-local box. In
particular, we show quantum correlations whose simulation requires an
exponential amount of non-local boxes, in the number of maximally entangled
qubit pairs.

measurement theory. However, if we do not want to succeed all the time, i.e.
allow for inconclusive outcomes to occur, then unambiguous discrimination
becomes possible with a certain probability of success. A variant of the
problem is set discrimination: the states are grouped in sets and we want to
determine to which particular set a given pure input state belongs. We consider
here the simplest case, termed quantum state filtering, when the $N$ given
non-orthogonal states, $\{|\psi_{1} >,..., |\psi_{N} > \}$, are divided into
two sets and the first set consists of one state only while the second consists
of all of the remaining states. We present the derivation of the optimal
measurement strategy, in terms of a generalized measurement (POVM), to
distinguish $|\psi_1>$ from the set $\{|\psi_2 >,...,|\psi_N > \}$ and the
corresponding optimal success and failure probabilities. The results, but not
the complete derivation, were presented previously [\prl {\bf 90}, 257901

probabilistic quantum algorithms. We also show that the problem is equivalent
to the discrimination of a pure state and an arbitrary mixed state.
