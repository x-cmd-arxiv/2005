SVS20-South, the more luminous of the two sources, exhibits a mid-infrared

shallow amorphous silicate absorption spectrum with a peak optical depth of
$\tau \sim 0.3$. After removal of the the line-of-sight extinction by the
molecular common envelope, the ``protostar-only'' spectra are found to be
dominated by strong amorphous olivine emission peaking near 10 \micron. We also
find evidence for emission from crystalline forsterite and enstatite associated
with both SVS20-S and SVS20-N. The presence of crystalline silicate in such a
young binary system indicates that the grain processing found in more evolved

This combination permits the study of quasi-steady turbulence in a cloudy
medium representing the warm/cold atomic ISM. Turbulence is driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI); our models are the first to study the
saturated state of MRI under strongly inhomogeneous conditions, with
cloud/intercloud contrasts of about 100. For volume-averaged densities n=0.25 -
4 cm^3, the saturated-state velocity dispersion ranges from 8-1 km/s, scaling
as n^-0.77. The MRI is therefore likely quite important in driving turbulence
in low-density ISM regions, both at high latitudes in the inner Galaxy,and
throughout the far outer Galaxy. The MRI may be key to suppressing star
formation at large radii in spiral galaxies, where without MRI-driven
turbulence, a thin, cold layer could form and become gravitationally instable.

density PDFs are broadened and include extreme departures from equilibrium, but

we determined the size of SN 2001em. It is only marginally resolved at our

eccentricity is <e>=0.25 (excluding those tidally circularized), lower than

eccentricity, suggesting that the circular orbits of giant planets in our Solar

1.2$\pm$0.3 %. The probability of occurrence of planets varies as the square of
the stellar metal abundance, $P \propto N^2_Fe, ranging from $<$3% for stars of

property which we call cosmic mimicry. Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the
fact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is
virtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point
to note is that the \Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM
cosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early
times), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe
with the value of \Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter
density. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost
exactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological
density parameter \Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic
mimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld
Lagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of
gravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological
density parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the
effective gravitational constant in braneworld theory. A subclass of mimicry
models lead to an older age of the universe and also predict a redshift of
reionization which is lower than z_{reion} \simeq 17 in the LCDM cosmology.
These models might therefore provide a background cosmology which is in better
agreement both with the observed quasar abundance at z \gsim 4 and with the
large optical depth to reionization measured by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe.

area. For many applications in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, geocasting
is an important and frequent communication service. The challenging problem in
geocasting is distributing the packets to all the nodes within the geocast
region with high probability but with low overhead. According to our study we
notice a clear tradeoff between the proportion of nodes in the geocast region
that receive the packet and the overhead incurred by the geocast packet
especially at low densities and irregular distributions. We present two novel
protocols for geocasting that achieve high delivery rate and low overhead by
utilizing the local location information of nodes to combine geographic routing
mechanisms with region flooding. We show that the first protocol
Geographic-Forwarding-Geocast (GFG) has close-to-minimum overhead in dense
networks and that the second protocol Geographic-Forwarding-Perimeter-Geocast
(GFPG) provides guaranteed delivery without global flooding or global network
information even at low densities and with the existence of region gaps or
obstacles. An adaptive version of the second protocol (GFPG*) has the desirable
property of perfect delivery at all densities and close-to-minimum overhead at
high densities. We evaluate our mechanisms and compare them using simulation to
other proposed geocasting mechanisms. The results show the significant
improvement in delivery rate (up to 63% higher delivery percentage in low
density networks) and reduction in overhead (up to 80% reduction) achieved by
our mechanisms. We hope for our protocols to become building block mechanisms
for dependable sensor network architectures that require robust efficient
geocast services.

observables of the Michelson and Sagnac types have been interpreted physically
as the virtual measurements of a synthesized interferometer. In this paper, I
present Geometric TDI, a new and intuitive approach to extend this
interpretation to all TDI observables. Unlike the standard algebraic formalism,
Geometric TDI provides a combinatorial algorithm to explore exhaustively the
space of second-generation TDI observables (i.e., those that cancel laser noise
in LISA-like interferometers with time-dependent armlengths). Using this
algorithm, I survey the space of second-generation TDI observables of length
(i.e., number of component phase measurements) up to 24, and I identify
alternative, improved forms of the standard second-generation TDI observables.
The alternative forms have improved high-frequency gravitational-wave
sensitivity in realistic noise conditions (because they have fewer nulls in the
gravitational-wave and noise response functions), and are less susceptible to
instrumental gaps and glitches (because their component phase measurements span
shorter time periods).

Quantization proceeds in the spirit of Dirac: First one defines an algebra of

result of the paper concerns the representation theory of the kinematical
algebra: We show that there is only one cyclic representation invariant under
spatial diffeomorphisms.
  While this result is particularly important for loop quantum gravity, we are
rather general: The precise definition of the abstract *-algebra of the basic
kinematical observables we give could be used for any theory in which the
configuration variable is a connection with a compact structure group. The
variables are constructed from the holonomy map and from the fluxes of the
momentum conjugate to the connection. The uniqueness result is relevant for any
such theory invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms or being a part of a
diffeomorphism invariant theory.

each bulk having its own corresponding IR (TeV) brane. Sources for electroweak

easily separated out from the relative variables. For a N-body system these
latter are usually described by a set of Jacobi normal coordinates, based on
the clustering of the centers of mass of sub-clusters. The Jacobi variables are
then the starting point for separating {\it orientational} variables, connected
with the angular momentum constants of motion, from {\it shape} (or {\it
vibrational}) variables. Jacobi variables, however, cannot be extended to
special relativity. We show by group-theoretical methods that two new sets of
relative variables can be defined in terms of a {\it clustering of the angular
momenta of sub-clusters} and directly related to the so-called {\it dynamical
body frames} and {\it canonical spin bases}. The underlying group-theoretical
structure allows a direct extension of such notions from a non-relativistic to
a special- relativistic context if one exploits the {\it rest-frame instant
form of dynamics}. The various known definitions of relativistic center of mass
are recovered. The separation of suitable relative variables from the so-called
{\it canonical internal} center of mass leads to the correct kinematical
framework for the relativistic theory of the orbits for a N-body system with
action -at-a-distance interactions. The rest-frame instant form is also shown
to be the correct kinematical framework for introducing the Dixon multi-poles
for closed and open N-body systems, as well as for continuous systems,
exemplified here by the configurations of the Klein-Gordon field that are
compatible with the previous notions of center of mass.

the EVP with another method for mean-field spin systems: the self-consistent
mean-field equations. The two approaches lead to dual convex optimization
problems. This is a new connection, and it permits a generalization of the EVP.

  1. In the presence of intersection multiplicities, there are two different

edges that are multisets rather than sets. We show that the chromatic numbers
are substantially different for the two concepts of hypergraphs. The lower
bounds of Sarkaria (1990) and Ziegler (2002) apply only to the multiset
version.
  2. The reductions to the case of prime $r$ in the proofs Sarkaria and by
Ziegler work only if the intersection multiplicities are strictly smaller than
the largest prime factor of $r$. Currently we have no valid proof for the lower
bound result in the other cases.
  We also show that all uniform hypergraphs without multiset edges can be
represented as generalized Kneser hypergraphs.

occurs with a certain bias in choosing the positions of the editing sites. In
the mitochondrial genes of {\it Physarum polycephalum}, many more editing
events have been observed at the third codon position than at the first and

Here we propose an evolutionary model that explains this bias as the basis of

scaled particle theory (SPT) and by using the technique of the factored
partition function of the Simplified Perturbed Hard Chain Theory (SPHCT). The
chemical potentials, and the respective thermodynamic Affinity, have been
calculated for typical components of the hydrogen-carbon (H-C) system over a
range pressures between 1-100 kbar, and at temperatures consistent with those
of the depths of the Earth at such pressures. The theoretical analyses
establish that the normal alkanes, the homologous hydrocarbon group of lowest
chemical potential, evolve only at pressures greater than approximately thirty
kbar, excepting only the lightest, methane. The pressure of thirty kbar
corresponds to depths of approximately 100 km.
  Special high-pressure apparatus has been designed which permits
investigations at pressures to 50 kbar and temperatures to 2000 K, and which
also allows rapid cooling while maintaining high pressures. The high-pressure

describes reaction diffusion systems in population dynamics are studied with
the help of an analytic prescription and shown to lead to interesting
consequences for the evolution of population densities. The initial value
problem is solved explicitly for some cases and for others it is shown how to
find traveling wave solutions analytically. The effect of adding diffusion to
the convective equations is first studied through exact analysis through a
piecewise linear representation of the nonlinearity. Using an appropriate small
parameter suggested by that analysis, a perturbative treatment is developed to
treat the case in which the convective evolution is augmented by a small amount
of diffusion.

wavepacket of the harmonic oscillator. We show that disregarding the
non-significant tails of a function which is the superposition of
eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator has a remarkable consequence: namely,
there exist infinitely many different superpositions giving rise to the same
function on the interval. Uniqueness, in the case of a wavepacket, is restored
by a postulate of quantum mechanics.

Poisson and Wigner-Dyson. It is shown that they can be simulated on a quantum
computer with a small number of gates, and efficiently yield information about
fidelity decay or spectral statistics. We study their matrix elements and
entanglement production, and show that they converge with time to distributions
which differ from random matrix predictions. A randomized version of these maps
can be implemented even more economically, and yields pseudorandom operators
with original properties, enabling for example to produce fractal random
vectors. These algorithms are within reach of present-day quantum computers.

evaluate its coding efficiency.
