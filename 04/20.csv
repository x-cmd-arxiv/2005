172 survey objects, 85 were detected. Among the 22 multiple systems observed,
15 were resolved and their individual component fluxes determined. A plot of
the frequency distribution of the detected objects with SED spectral slope
shows that YSOs spend ~400,000 yr in the Flat Spectrum phase, clearing out
their remnant infall envelopes. Mid-infrared variability is found among a
significant fraction of the surveyed objects, and is found to occur for all SED
classes with optically thick disks. Large-amplitude near-infrared variability,
also found for all SED classes with optically thick disks, seems to occur with
somewhat higher frequency at the earlier evolutionary stages. Although a
general trend of mid-infrared excess and NIR veiling exists proceeding through
SED classes, with Class I objects generally exhibiting K-veilings > 1, Flat
Spectrum objects with K-veilings > 0.58, and Class III objects with K-veilings
=0, Class II objects exhibit the widest range of K-band veiling values, 0-4.5.
However, the highly variable value of veiling that a single source can exhibit
in any of the SED classes in which active disk accretion can take place is
striking, and is direct observational evidence for highly time-variable
accretion activity in disks. Finally, by comparing mid-infrared vs.
near-infrared excesses in a subsample with well-determined effective
temperatures and extinction values, disk clearing mechanisms are explored. The
results are consistent with disk clearing proceeding from the inside-out.

UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the LMC
extinction while FIR-selected galaxy attenuation laws more resemble the MW
extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the

2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ). To interpret the z-space correlation function,
xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the QSO real-space correlation
function, xi(r). Although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projected
correlation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat too
shallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),
at larger scales > 20 h^(-1) Mpc. Motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the
2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and in standard LCDM predictions, we use a
double power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).
The model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1<r<10 h^(-1) Mpc and
gamma=2.30 for 10<r<40 h^(-1) Mpc. As found for 2dFGRS, the value of beta
determined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form of
xi(r) assumed. With our double power-law form for xi(r), we measure
beta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). Assuming the same model for xi(r) we then
analyse the z-space distortions in the 2QZ xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints on
the values of Omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the method
of Hoyle et al. The constraints we derive are Omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),
beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results at
the ~1 sigma level.

combined influence of the temperature and chemical composition gradients along
the surface and of the Hall effect. Both the oscillatory and non-oscillatory
modes can be unstable in accreting stars. The oscillatory instability grows on
a short timescale of the order os 0.1-10 s depending on the lengthscale of a
surface inhomogeneity and the wavelength of perturbations. The instability of
non-oscillatory modes is typically much slower and can develop on a timescale
of hours or days. Instability generates a weak turbulence that can be
responsible for mixing between the surface and deep ocean layers and for
spreading the accreted material over the stellar surface. Spectral features of
heavy elements can be detected in the atmospheres of accreting stars due to
mixing, and these features should be different in neutron stars with stable and
unstable burning. Motions caused by instability can also be the reason for slow
variations in the luminosity.

possible large scale homogeneity. Moreover, some authors have proposed that
different scaling regimes might be discerned at different lenght scales. To go
further on into this issue, we have applied the correlation integral method to
the wider sample currently available. We therefore obtain a fractal dimension
of the galaxy distribution which seems to vary by steps whose width might be
related to the organization hierarchy observed for the galaxies. This result
could explain some of the previous results obtained by other authors from the

should expect local damped Lyman-alpha systems to reside in such gas-rich

higher redshifts where less of the gas is in the dense inner regions of
galaxies or has been consumed by star formation. This local galaxy is the only

thin FeNi, the switching fields are masked by the smooth and step-free major

transition from a homogenous Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase to phases

redshift and other clock experiments support local position invariance.
Together these results confirm the Einstein Equivalence Principle which
underlies the concept that gravitation is synonymous with spacetime geometry,
and must be described by a metric theory. Solar system experiments that test
the weak-field, post-Newtonian limit of metric theories strongly favor general
relativity. The Binary Pulsar provides tests of gravitational-wave damping and
of strong-field general relativity. Recently discovered binary pulsar systems
may provide additional tests. Future and ongoing experiments, such as the
Gravity Probe B Gyroscope Experiment, satellite tests of the Equivalence
principle, and tests of gravity at short distance to look for extra spatial
dimensions could constrain extensions of general relativity. Laser
interferometric gravitational-wave observatories on Earth and in space may
provide new tests of gravitational theory via detailed measurements of the

Tevatron or CERN LHC have focused on the so-called mSUGRA (minimal supergravity
mediated supersymmetry breaking) model, not because it is well motivated but
because it has a minimal number of parameters. If signals are seen that could
be superpartners, most analyses will attempt to interpret them in the mSUGRA
framework since the needed software and computational tools exist. With only a
few signal channels, and initially large statistical and systematic errors, it
is very likely that an mSUGRA interpretation will look all right even if it is
not. We present an approach to studying any potential signals of new physics in
``inclusive signature space'' that sensitively tests any proposed
interpretation, and apply it to the mSUGRA case. The approach also has
significant experimental advantages, reducing the sensitivity to jet energy
corrections, dependence on beam luminosity, and other systematics. Basically,
if one (or more) instances of reported data lies outside certain bounded
regions of inclusive signature space characteristic of the physics being
tested, that physics is excluded for any parameters. The approach can be used
to study supersymmetry breaking and to point to the form of the underlying
theory even without detailed measurements of a number of important parameters
which will be difficult or impossible to measure at hadron colliders.

SYM theory at vanishing coupling constant is dual to a theory in AdS which
exhibits higher spin gauge symmetry enhancement. When the SYM coupling is
non-zero, the current conservation condition becomes anomalous, and
correspondingly the local higher spin symmetry in the bulk gets spontaneously
broken. In agreement with previous results and holographic expectations, we
find that the Goldstone mode responsible for the symmetry breaking in AdS has a
non-vanishing mass even in the limit in which the gauge symmetry is restored.
Moreover, we show that the mass of the Goldstone mode is exactly the one
predicted by the correspondence. Finally, we obtain the precise form of the
higher spin supercurrents in the SYM side.

alleviated. Combining the KKLT mechanism for moduli stabilization and a shift
symmetry breaking superpotential of the chaotic inflation type, we find models

is curved in the moduli--inflaton plane. We analyze the phenomenology of these

Transitions between the states occur at random time intervals. In the active
state, the rate at which wealth increases is greater than that in the inactive
state. In both the states, wealth diminishes at a rate proportional to the
current wealth. The probability density function describing the wealth
distribution in the steady state is found to have the form of a beta
distribution. Wealth distributions for the poor, middle and the rich classes
are obtained separately. In economic literature, beta distribution and its
generalisations, namely, the generalised beta distribution functions have been
proposed to describe the income distributions of different economic societies.

fields coupled to the atom if certain conditions are satisfied. This is of
particular interest to control interference effects, which can alter the system
properties considerably. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of such
phase control and interference effects in an atomic three-level system in
$\Lambda$ configuration, where the upper state spontaneously decays into the
two lower states. The lower states are coupled by a driving field, which we
treat as quantized. This allows for an interpretation on the single photon
level for both the vacuum and the driving field. By analyzing the system
behavior for a driving field initially in non-classical states with only few
Fock number states populated, we find that even though the driving field is
coupled to the lower states only, it induces a multiplet of upper states. Then
interference occurs independently in three-level subsystems in $V$
configuration, each formed by two adjacent upper states and a single dressed
lower state.

of their continuous variables, namely, their magnetic fluxes and induced
