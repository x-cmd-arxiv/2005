galaxies. The face-on view provides a novel perspective on peanuts which would
allow study of their relation to bars and disks in greater detail than hitherto
possible. The diagnostic is based on the fact that peanut shapes are associated
with a flat density distribution in the vertical direction. We show that the
kinematic signature corresponding to such a distribution is a minimum in the
fourth-order Gauss-Hermite moment $s_4$. We demonstrate our method on $N$-body
simulations of varying peanut strength, showing that strong peanuts can be
recognized to inclinations $i \simeq 30\degrees$, regardless of the strength of
the bar. We also consider compound systems in which a bulge is present in the
initial conditions as may happen if bulges form at high redshift through
mergers. We show that in this case, because the vertical structure of the bulge
is not derived from that of the disk, that the signature of a peanut in $s_4$
is weakened. Thus the same kinematic signature of peanuts can be used to
explore bulge formation mechanisms. The observational requirements for
identifying peanuts with this method are challenging, but feasible.

the actual torque on the superfluid. The proper spin-down rate of a pinned

after the initial main burst, much higher than energy of the main burst, causes
the re-burst appearance in GRB afterglow and illuminates the region of the disk
surface with $\tau\approx1$($\tau$ is the optical depth for the Thomson scatter

This model can explain the appearance of re-burst and emission lines in GRB
afterglow and disappearance of the iron emission lines, and also can naturally
solve the problem of higher energy of the illuminating continuum than that of
the main burst. This scenario is different from the models put forward to
explain the emission lines before, that can be tested by SWIFT satellite.

efforts of the MACHO, OGLE, EROS and MOA experiments monitoring the bulge.
Using Galactic models, we construct mock catalogues of microlensing light

error bars of the OGLE-II experiment. The fraction of parallax events with
delta chi^2 > 50 in the OGLE-II database is around ~1%, though higher fractions
are reported by some other surveys. This is in accord with expectations from
standard Galactic models. The fraction of parallax events depends strongly on
the Einstein crossing time (t_E), being less than 5% at t_E = 50 days but
rising to 50% at t_E > 1 yr. We find that the existence of parallax signatures
is essentially controlled by the acceleration of the observer normalised to the
projected Einstein radius on the observer plane divided by t_E^2. The
properties of the parallax events - time-scales, projected velocities, source
and lens locations - in our mock catalogues are analysed. Typically, ~38% of
parallax events are caused by a disk star microlensing a bulge source, while
\~33% are caused by a disk star microlensing a disk source (of these disk
sources, one sixth are at a distance of 5 kpc or less). There is a significant
shift in mean time-scale from 32 d for all events to ~130d for our parallax
events. There are corresponding shifts for other parameters, such as the
lens-source velocity projected onto the observer plane (~1110 km/s for all
events versus ~80 km/s for parallax events) and the lens distance (6.7 kpc
versus 3.7 kpc). We also assess the performance of parallax mass estimators and
investigate whether our mock catalogue can reproduce events with features
similar to a number of conjectured `black hole' lens candidates.

are equivalent, having similar colors and global scales. However, the scale of

expected in the London limit, thus revealing the non-local response of these

the London penetration depth lambda_L is extracted. In the case of Pb also the
clean limit coherence length xi0 is obtained. Furthermore we find that the

are rather well described within the Pippard and BCS models, for Ta this is
only true to a lesser degree. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that
the superfluid density is decreased by approaching the surface on a length
scale xi0. This effect, which is not taken self-consistently into account in
the mentioned models, should be more pronounced in the lowest kappa regime

the gap at large frequencies are discussed, also as a function of temperature

provide a smooth transition from a renormalized regime at low to the bare

the temperature dependence of the restricted optical sum leading to a
non-negligible violation of the sum rule in the d-CDW state.

multilayers and the scattering potentials of point defects therein are
calculated self-consistently. Residual resistivities are obtained by solving
the quasi-classical Boltzmann equation including the electronic structure of
the layered system, the anisotropic scattering cross sections derived by a
Green's function method and the vertex corrections. Furthermore, the influence
of scattering centers at the interfaces and within the metallic layers is
incorporated by averaging the scattering cross sections of different impurities
at various sites. An excellent agreement of experimental and theoretical
results concerning the general trend of GMR in Co/Cu systems depending on the
type and the position of impurities is obtained. Due to the quantum confinement
in magnetic multilayers GMR can be tailored as a function of the impurity
position. In Co/Cu and Fe/Au systems impurities in the magnetic layer lead to
high GMR values, whereas in Fe/Cr systems defects at the interfaces are most
efficient to increase GMR.

  Model","12 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory, April 21st 2005",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT",,"  The problem of determining asymptotic bounds on the capacity of a random ad
hoc network is considered. Previous approaches assumed a threshold-based link
layer model in which a packet transmission is successful if the SINR at the
receiver is greater than a fixed threshold. In reality, the mapping from SINR
to packet success probability is continuous. Hence, over each hop, for every
finite SINR, there is a non-zero probability of packet loss. With this more
realistic link model, it is shown that for a broad class of routing and
scheduling schemes, a fixed fraction of hops on each route have a fixed
non-zero packet loss probability. In a large network, a packet travels an
asymptotically large number of hops from source to destination. Consequently,
it is shown that the cumulative effect of per-hop packet loss results in a
per-node throughput of only O(1/n) (instead of Theta(1/sqrt{n log{n}})) as
shown previously for the threshold-based link model).
  A scheduling scheme is then proposed to counter this effect. The proposed
scheme improves the link SINR by using conservative spatial reuse, and improves
the per-node throughput to O(1/(K_n sqrt{n log{n}})), where each cell gets a
transmission opportunity at least once every K_n slots, and K_n tends to
infinity as n tends to infinity.

semi-classically on the basis of a mathematically rigorous version of

classical orbits. A critical point of the potential with zero momentum is an
equilibrium of the flow and generates certain singularities in the spectrum.
Via sharp spectral estimates, this fluctuation indicates the presence of a
critical point and allows to reconstruct partially the local shape of the
potential. Some generalizations of this approach are also proposed.\medskip

satisfies a transport equation, and many of these states break time reversal
symmetry. Moreover, an explicit example of such a state, called the Hot Bang

the proof of existence of an analogue of the Hot Bang state is not quite that

models where some coefficients are reduced to zero. Data were used to select a
model with estimated coefficients. Is it possible to do so and still come up
with an estimator always better than the traditional estimator based on the
full model? The James-Stein estimator is such an estimator, having a property
called minimaxity. However, the estimator considers only one reduced model,
namely the origin. Hence it reduces no coefficient estimator to zero or every
coefficient estimator to zero. In many applications including wavelet analysis,
what should be more desirable is to reduce to zero only the estimators smaller
than a threshold, called thresholding in this paper. Is it possible to
construct this kind of estimators which are minimax? In this paper, we
construct such minimax estimators which perform thresholding. We apply our
recommended estimator to the wavelet analysis and show that it performs the
best among the well-known estimators aiming simultaneously at estimation and
model selection. Some of our estimators are also shown to be asymptotically
optimal.

last decade. Motivated by studies in genomics, microarrays, DNA sequencing,
drug screening, clinical trials, bioassays, education and psychology,
statisticians have been devoting considerable research energy in an effort to
properly analyze multiple endpoint data. In response to new applications, new
criteria and new methodology, many ad hoc procedures have emerged. The
classical requirement has been to use procedures which control the strong
familywise error rate (FWE) at some predetermined level \alpha. That is, the
probability of any false rejection of a true null hypothesis should be less
than or equal to \alpha. Finding desirable and powerful multiple test
procedures is difficult under this requirement. One of the more recent ideas is
concerned with controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), that is, the
expected proportion of rejected hypotheses which are, in fact, true. Many
multiple test procedures do control the FDR. A much earlier approach to
multiple testing was formulated by Lehmann [Ann. Math. Statist. 23 (1952)
541-552 and 28 (1957) 1-25]. Lehmann's approach is decision theoretic and he
treats the multiple endpoints problem as a 2^k finite action problem when there
are k endpoints. This approach is appealing since unlike the FWE and FDR
criteria, the finite action approach pays attention to false acceptances as
well as false rejections.

consisting of two components. The two components lead to a vector risk. One
component of the vector risk is the false rejection rate (FRR), that is, the
expected number of false rejections. The other component is the false
acceptance rate (FAR), that is, the expected number of acceptances for which
the corresponding null hypothesis is false. This loss function is more
stringent than the positive linear combination loss function of Lehmann [Ann.

33 126-144] in the sense that the class of admissible rules is larger for this
vector risk formulation than for the linear combination risk function. In other
words, fewer procedures are inadmissible for the vector risk formulation. The
statistical model assumed is that the vector of variables Z is multivariate
normal with mean vector \mu and known intraclass covariance matrix \Sigma. The
endpoint hypotheses are H_i:\mu_i=0 vs K_i:\mu_i>0, i=1,...,k. A
characterization of all symmetric Bayes procedures and their limits is
obtained. The characterization leads to a complete class theorem. The complete

combining methods, with supporting asymptotic theory which should be of
practical interest. The key point of the adaptive development is that the
methods attempt to combine only the correct information, downweighting or
excluding studies containing little or wrong information about the true
parameter of interest. The combination methodologies are illustrated in

weighted scatter estimators can integrate high breakdown point and high

intervals based on the sample quantile of a random sample of size n. We sharpen
the latter result to O(n^{-5/6}) with proper choices of bandwidths at the

the coverage error of the smoothed bootstrap percentile interval to the order

Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We exploit the
symmetries of the problem, in particular the Hamiltonian structure and the
$\U(1)$ symmetry. We develop a simple sufficient criterion that guarantees the
existence of a modulational instability spectrum along the imaginary axis. In
the case of small amplitude solutions that bifurcate from the band edges of the
linear problem this criterion becomes especially simple. We find that the small
amplitude solutions corresponding to the band edges alternate stability, with
the first band edge being modulationally unstable in the focusing case, the
second band edge being modulationally unstable in the defocusing case, and so
on. This small amplitude result has a nice physical interpretation in terms of
the effective mass of a particle in the periodic potential. We also consider,
in somewhat less detail, some sideband instabilities in the small amplitude
limit. We find that, depending on the Krein signature of the collision, these
can be of one of two types. Finally we illustrate this with some exact
calculations in the case where $V(x)$ is an elliptic function, where all of the
relevant calculations can be done explicitly.

disordered square lattices. The players are pure strategists and can either
cooperate or defect with their immediate neighbors. In the generations each
player update its strategy by following one of the neighboring strategies with
a probability dependent on the payoff difference. The neighbor selection obeys
a dynamic preferential rule, i.e., the more frequently a neighbor's strategy
was adopted by the focal player in the previous rounds, the larger probability
it will be chosen to refer to in the subsequent rounds. It is found that
cooperation is substantially promoted due to this simple selection mechanism.
Corresponding analysis is provided by the investigations of the distribution of
