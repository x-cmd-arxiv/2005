features associated with carbon stars, such as V778 Cyg. We have attempted to
constrain these theories by means of mapping water maser mission from V778 Cyg.
The 22 GHz water maser emission from this star has been mapped using MERLIN
with an astrometric accuracy of 25 mas. The spatially- and
kinematically-resolved maser complex is displaced by about 190 mas from the
position of the C-star as measured 10 years earlier using Tycho. Our
simulations and analysis of available data show that this position difference
is unlikely to be due to proper motion if V778 Cyg is at the assumed distance
of 1.4 kpc. The maser components seem to form a distorted S-shaped structure
extended over 18 mas with a clear velocity gradient. We propose a model which
explains the observed water maser structure as an O-rich warped disk around a
companion of the C-star in V 778 binary system, which is seen almost edge-on.
Analysis of observational data, especially those obtained with MERLIN, suggests
that V778 Cyg (and, by implication, other silicate carbon stars) are binary
systems composed of a C-rich star and a companion which stores circumstellar
O-rich material.

background subtraction methods for large extended sources filling the EPIC
field of view, such as nearby galaxy clusters, for which local background
estimation is difficult. We find that to keep the 0.8-7.0 keV band background
modeling uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filter
than that commonly applied. In particular, because flares have highly variable
spectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the E>10 keV light curve.
We tried using the outer part of the EPIC FOV for monitoring the background in
a softer band (1-5 keV). We find that one needs to discard the time periods
when either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value by
more than 20% in order to limit the 90% CL background uncertainty to between 5%
at E=4-7 keV and 20% at E=0.8-1 keV, for both MOS and PN. This compares to a
10-30% respective PN uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is used
for filtering, and to a 15-45% PN uncertainty when applying the commonly used
2-3 sigma filtering method. We illustrate our method on a nearby cluster A1795.
The above background uncertainties convert into the systematic temperature
uncertainties between 1% at r=3-4 arcmin and 20--25% (~1 keV for A1795) at
r=10-15 arcmin. For comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 sigma clipping of the
hard-band light curve misses a significant amount of flares, rendering the
temperatures beyond r=10 arcmin unconstrained. Thus, the background
uncertainties do not prohibit the EPIC temperature profile analysis of
low-brightness regions, like outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided a
conservative flare filtering such as the double filtering method with 20%
limits is used.

motion, in combination with the growth and polarization measurements, suggests
an asymmetric outflow, mainly from one side of the magnetar. We find a
deceleration in the expansion, from ~9 mas/day to <5 mas/day. The time of
deceleration is roughly coincident with the rebrightening in the radio light
curve, as expected to result when the ejecta from the GF sweeps up enough of

oscillations, we determine the phase diagram of magnetic excitations caused by
torques from DC spin-polarized currents in (thin permalloy)/copper/(thick
permalloy) multilayer samples. We extend the measurements to larger values of
current than have been reported previously. We find several additional modes
that we are able to identify with motion of the thick magnetic layer as well as
the thin one. Peaks in the microwave spectra at multiple frequencies suggest
that spatially non-uniform dynamical states can be important in some
circumstances. We compare the experimental phase diagram with simple

consider the class of general homogeneous, isotropic initial states for quantum
scalar fields in Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetimes, subject to the requirement
that their ultraviolet behavior be consistent with renormalizability of the
covariantly conserved stress tensor which couples to gravity. In the functional
Schr\""odinger picture such states are coherent, squeezed, mixed states
characterized by a Gaussian density matrix. This Gaussian has parameters which
approach those of the adiabatic vacuum at large wave number, and evolve in time
according to an effective classical Hamiltonian. The one complex parameter
family of $\alpha$ squeezed states in de Sitter spacetime does not fall into
this UV allowed class, except for the special value of the parameter
corresponding to the Bunch-Davies state. We determine the finite contributions
to the inflationary power spectrum and stress tensor expectation value of
general UV allowed adiabatic states, and obtain quantitative limits on the
observability and backreaction effects of some recently proposed models of
short distance modifications of the initial state of inflation. For all UV
allowed states, the second order adiabatic basis provides a good description of
particles created in the expanding RW universe. Due to the absence of particle
creation for the massless, minimally coupled scalar field in de Sitter space,
there is no phase decoherence in the simplest free field inflationary models.
We apply adiabatic regularization to the renormalization of the decoherence
functional in cosmology to corroborate this result.

the limiting density, while the corrections to the Airy kernel at the soft edge
