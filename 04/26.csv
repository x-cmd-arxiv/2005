star formation rate per unit mass, or the specific star formation rate. From
this correlation we show that a critical shear rate exists, above which star
formation would turn off in the disks of spiral galaxies. Using the correlation
between shear rate and spiral arm pitch angle, this shear rate corresponds to
the lowest pitch angles typically measured in near-infrared images of spiral

that when a larger fraction of the host halo mass is in subhalos, the resulting
power spectrum has less power at 1 < k < 100 h Mpc^{-1} and more power at k >
100 h Mpc^{-1}. We explain this effect using an analytic halo model including
subhalos, which shows that the 1 < k < 100 h Mpc^{-1} regime depends
sensitively on the radial distribution of subhalo centers while the interior
structure of subhalos is important at k > 100 h Mpc^{-1}. The corresponding
effect due to substructures on the weak lensing power spectrum is up to about
11% at angular scale l < 10^4. Predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a few

in the OVII K-series and K\alpha transitions from neon, carbon, and nitrogen.
  From the three OVII lines we derive a 2\sigma Doppler parameter constraint of
24<b<55 km/s. The FUSE spectrum shows strong Galactic low--velocity OVI 1032A
absorption as well as a possible weak OVI high-velocity component (HVC). The
Doppler parameter of the low-velocity OVI measured with FUSE is ~3\sigma higher
than that derived from the OVII line ratios, indicating that the OVII and
Galactic OVI arise in different phases. This velocity dispersion, along with
limits on the gas temperature and density from the X-ray line ratios (assuming
a single phase with collisional ionization equilibrium plus photoionization)
are all consistent with an extragalactic absorber. However, the OVII Doppler
parameter is inconsistent with the high temperature required to produce the
observed OVI_HVC/OVII ratio, implying that the HVC is probably not related to
the OVII. In addition, the OVI_K\alpha line detected by Chandra implies a
column density ~4 times higher than the 1032A absorption. Although an
extragalactic absorber is fully consistent with the measured column density
ratios, a Galactic origin cannot be ruled out given the uncertainties in the
available data.

near-IR counterparts, but JHK photometry provides little evidence for near-IR
excesses. These core sources have typical mean photon energies of 2 keV and
about one-third are variable. It is likely that some are young low-mass stars
in the cluster, but cluster membership remains to be determined. Grating
spectra show that the X-ray properties of HD 150135 and HD 150136 are similar,
but not identical. Both have moderately broadened unshifted emission lines and
their emission is dominated by cool plasma, pointing to a wind shock origin.
However, the emission of HD 150136 is slightly hotter and 4 times more luminous
than its optical twin HD 150135. We discuss the possibility that a radiative
colliding wind shock contributes to the prodigious X-ray output of the
short-period (2.66 d) binary HD 150136. A surprising result is that the X-ray
emission of HD 150136 is slowly variable on a timescale of less than one day.
The origin of the variability is not yet known, but the observed behavior
suggests that it is an occultation effect.

major obstacle in trying to understand the evolution of DLAs and sub-DLAs has
been the small number of metallicity measurements at z < 1.5, an epoch spanning
\~70 % of the cosmic history. In recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope
and Multiple Mirror Telescope, we have doubled the DLA Zn sample at z < 1.5.
Combining our results with those at higher redshifts from the literature, we
find that the global mean metallicity of DLAs does not rise to the solar value

mean metallicity observed for nearby (z ~ 0) galaxies and the predictions of
cosmic chemical evolution models based on the global star formation history.
Finally, we discuss direct constraints on the star formation rates (SFRs) in
the absorber galaxies from our deep Fabry-Perot Ly-alpha imaging study and
other emission-line studies in the literature. A large fraction of the observed
heavy-element quasar absorbers at 0 < z < 3.4 appear to have SFRs substantially

modeled by $\Gamma = 4/3$ equilibrium polytrope for simplicity and a parametric

wide variety of initial conditions changing the mass, the angular momentum, the
rotational velocity profile of the core, and the parameters of the equations of
state (which are chosen so that the maximum mass of the cold spherical
polytrope is $\approx 1.6M_{\odot}$), a criterion for the prompt black hole
formation is clarified in terms of them. It is found that (i) with the increase
of the thermal energy generated by shocks, the threshold mass for the prompt
black hole formation is increased by 20--40%, (ii) the rotational centrifugal
force increases the threshold mass by $\alt 25%$, (iii) with the increase of
the degree of differential rotation, the threshold mass is also increased, and
(iv) the amplification factors shown in the results (i)--(iii) depend
sensitively on the equation of state. We also find that the collapse dynamics
and the structure of the shock formed at the bounce depend strongly on the
stiffness of the adopted equation of state. In particular, as a new feature, a
strong bipolar explosion is observed for the collapse of rapidly rotating iron
cores with an equation of state which is stiff in subnuclear density and soft
in supranuclear density. Gravitational waves are computed in terms of a

that the CELR may take the form of a pc-scale, high filling factor, structure,

investigated. The general results obtained by Tripicco & Bell (1995) at solar

to which element every index reacts significantly, as a function of

  This work validates a number of assumptions implicitly made in the stellar

results of Tripicco & Bell (1995) to include the effects of element abundance
ratios variations. In particular, these computations confirm that fractional
changes to index strengths computed at solar metallicity (and solar age) can be
applied over a wide range of abundances and ages, also to model old stellar
populations with non-solar abundance ratios. The use of metallicity-dependent
response functions is, however, required for the proper modelling of the

ratio variations, the higher-order Balmer indices H gamma and H delta display
very strong dependencies at high metallicities. As shown in Thomas, Maraston &

strained silicon quantum well (QW), with the central cell effect treated by a
model impurity potential. We find that the increase of quantum well confinement
leads to shrinking charge distribution in all 3 dimensions. Using an
unrestricted Hartree-Fock method with Generalized Valence Bond (GVB)
single-particle wave functions, we are able to solve the two-electron
Sch${\ddot o}$dinger equation with quantum well confinement and realistic gate
potentials. The effects of QW width, gate voltages, donor separation, and donor
position are calculated and analyzed. The gate tunability and gate fidelity are
defined and evaluated, for a typical QC design. Estimates are obtained for the
duration of $\sqrt{SWAP}$ gate operation and the required accuracy in voltage
control. A strong exchange oscillation is observed as both donors are shifted
along [001] axis but with their separation unchanged. Applying a gate potential
tends to suppress the oscillation. The exchange oscillation as a function of
donor position along [100] axis is found to be completely suppressed as the
donor separation is decreased. The simulation presented in this paper is of
importance to the practical design of an exchange-based silicon quantum
computer.

cars is described by a stochastic master equation. Assuming that the escape
rate from a cluster depends only on the cluster size, the dynamics of the model

Knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of the transition rates for large
clusters allows us to apply an established criterion for phase separation in
one-dimensional driven systems. The distribution over cluster sizes in our
zero-range model is given by a one--step master equation in one dimension. It
provides an approximate mean--field dynamics, which, however, leads to the
exact stationary state. Based on this equation, we have calculated the critical
density at which phase separation takes place. We have shown that within a
certain range of densities above the critical value a metastable homogeneous
state exists before coarsening sets in. Within this approach we have estimated
the critical cluster size and the mean nucleation time for a condensate in a
large system. The metastablity in the zero-range process is reflected in a
metastable branch of the fundamental flux--density diagram of traffic flow. Our
work thus provides a possible analytical description of traffic jam formation
as well as important insight into condensation in the zero-range process.

multicritical point, and we verify that this point divides the line into two
different universality classes. One of them corresponds to the collapse driven

transition line between two collapsed phases (one bond-driven and the other

the bond driven collapse, which then forms the fourth universality class on the

exponents for collapsing trees. It is already harder to estimate the critical
exponents for the intermediate regime. Finally, it is very difficult to obtain
with our method good estimates of the critical parameters of the

is established through Dirac's Hamiltonian reduction of General Relativity and
Bogoliubov's transformation by analogy with a similar pathway passed by QFT in
20th century. The cosmological scale factor appears on this pathway as a zero
mode of the momentum constraints treated as a global excitation of the Landau
superfluid liquid type. This approach would be considered as the foundation of
the well--known Lifshitz cosmological perturbation theory, if it did not
contain the double counting of the scale factor as an obstruction to the Dirac
Hamiltonian method. After avoiding this ``double counting'' the Hamiltonian
cosmological perturbation theory does not contain the time derivatives of
gravitational potentials that are responsible for the CMB ``primordial power
spectrum'' in the inflationary model.
  The Hilbert -- Dirac -- Bogoliubov Quantum Gravity gives us another
possibility to explain this ``spectrum'' and other topical problems of
cosmology by the cosmological creation of both universes and particles from
Bogoliubov's vacuum. We listed the set of theoretical and observational
arguments in favor of that the CMB radiation can be a final product of
primordial vector W-, Z- bosons cosmologically created from the vacuum when
their Compton length coincides with the universe horizon. The equations
describing longitudinal vector bosons in SM, in this case, are close to the
equations of the inflationary model used for description of the ``power
primordial spectrum'' of the CMB radiation.

density anisotropies at recombination can be naturally understood in the
framework of standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology (without inflation)
as a consequence of the boundary conditions imposed by the causal horizon on
the statistical two-points correlation functions: the sub-horizon spectrum is
discrete (harmonic), with comoving modes located at $k_n = n
\frac{\pi}{H^{-1}_{eq}}$, $n = 1,2,...$, because the causally connected patch
of the universe at recombination is compact, with comoving radius
$H^{-1}_{eq}$. The results presented in this paper complement those presented
in [1], where it was shown that the scale invariance of the primordial density
anisotropies over comoving scales of cosmological size is also a consequence of
the boundary conditions imposed by causality. Together these results lay an
appealing theoretical alternative to the inflationary paradigm as the ultimate
answer for the origin of cosmological structures in standard cosmology.

microscopic black holes by cosmogenic neutrinos has been extensively studied in

elastically with a parton inside a nucleon, loses a small fraction y of its

ultraviolet dependence and the relevance of graviton emission in these

distribution of cosmogenic events in AMANDA and IceCube and the possibility of
multiple-bang events. For any neutrino flux, the observation of an enhanced
rate of neutral current events above 100 TeV in neutrino telescopes could be
explained by TeV-gravity interactions. The values of the fundamental scale of

consistency with quark and charged lepton data prevents the minimal setup from

the brane, and leads to a tachonic instability of the system on large scales.
Below the critical coupling, there is no tachyonic state and no bound state.
Instead, we find quasi-normal modes which describe stable oscillations, but
with a finite decay time. Only if the coupling is tuned to the critical value

laboratories for testing new concepts under mathematically controllable
condition. In more recent times low-dimensional models (e.g. chiral models,
factorizing models) often have been treated by special recipes in a way which
sometimes led to a loss of unity of QFT. In the present work I try to
counteract this apartheid tendency by reviewing past results within the setting
of the general principles of QFT. To this I add two new ideas: (1) a modular
interpretation of the chiral model Diff(S)-covariance with a close connection
to the recently formulated local covariance principle for QFT in curved
spacetime and (2) a derivation of the chiral model temperature duality from a
suitable operator formulation of the angular Wick rotation (in analogy to the
Nelson-Symanzik duality in the Ostertwalder-Schrader setting) for rational
chiral theories. The SL(2,Z) modular Verlinde relation is a special case of
this thermal duality and (within the family of rational models) the matrix S
appearing in the thermal duality relation becomes identified with the
statistics character matrix S. The relevant angular Euclideanization'' is done
in the setting of the Tomita-Takesaki modular formalism of operator algebras.
  I find it appropriate to dedicate this work to the memory of J. A. Swieca
with whom I shared the interest in two-dimensional models as a testing ground
for QFT for more than one decade.

and the homogenous 3-ary tree concerning stochastic domination and Ising
models; while it is known that the plus states for different temperatures on
$Z^d$ are never stochastically ordered, on the homogenous 3-ary tree, almost
the complete opposite is the case. Next, we show that on $Z^d$, the set of
product measures which the plus state for the Ising model dominates is strictly
increasing in the temperature. Finally, we obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for a finite number of variables, which are both FKG and
exchangeable, to dominate a given product measure.

electron beam. The target cell has a wide aperture for scattered electrons and
is axially symmetric around the beam axis. The construction is optimized to
intensify heat exchange by a transverse turbulent mixing in the hydrogen
stream, which is directed along the electron beam. The target is constructed as
a closed loop circulating system cooled by a helium refrigerator. It is
operated by a tangential mechanical pump with an optional natural convection

detailed statistics of numbers in the World Wide Web, finding that their
distribution is a heavy-tailed dependence which splits in a set of power-law
ones. In particular, we find that the frequency of numbers associated to
western calendar years shows an uneven behavior: 2004 represents a `singular
critical' point, appearing with a strikingly high frequency; as we move away
from it, the decreasing frequency allows us to compare the amounts of existing
information on the past and on the future. Moreover, while powers of ten occur
extremely often, allowing us to obtain statistics up to the huge 10^127,
`non-round' numbers occur in a much more limited range, the variations of their
frequencies being dramatically different from standard statistical
fluctuations. These findings provide a view of the array of numbers used by
humans as a highly non-equilibrium and inhomogeneous system, and shed a new

for the determination of weak chaos in time series dynamics. Existing SDA
procedures do not account properly for the rich structures observed in stock
return sequences, attributed to the presence of heteroscedasticity, seasonal
effects and outliers. In this paper we suggest a modification of the SDA
framework, based on the robust estimation of location and scale parameters of
mean-stationary time series and a probabilistic framework which deals with
outliers. A demonstration on the NASDAQ Composite index daily returns shows
that the proposed approach produces surrogates that faithfully reproduce the
structure of the original series while being manifestations of linear-random
dynamics.

manifolds is used to formulate a generating function pertinent to its
topological properties. In particular, a polynomial in terms of one variable
and a tori underlying this polynomial may be defined that generates an
individual cohomological count. This includes the de Rham complex for example,
as well as various index theorems by definition such as homotopy. The degree of
the polynomials depends on the volume used to define the region parameterizing
the manifolds; its potentially complex form and L-series is not presented in
this work. However, the polynomials and the relevant torii uniformize the
topological properties in various dimensions; in various dimensions this is
interesting in view of known topologies.

each SQUID is utilized to facilitate coherent control and manipulation of
quantum states of the qubits. It is interesting to note that a $n$-qubit
controlled phase gate can be achieved with $n$ SQUIDs by successively applying
a $\pi /2$ Jaynes-Cummings pulse to each of the $n-1$ control SQUIDs before and

non-contextual and local Hidden variable theory. The impossibility of replacing
quantum mechanics by non-contextual Hidden Variable Theory can be turned to a
impossible coloring pseudo-telepathy game to be played by two distant players.
The game can not be won without communication in the classical world. But if
the players share entangled state (quantum correlation) the game can be won
deterministically using no communication. This again shows that though quantum
correlation can not be used for communication, two parties can not simulate
quantum correlation without classical communication. The motivation of the
article is to present the earlier works on Hidden Variable Theory and recently
developed pseudo-telepathy problem in a simpler way, which may be helpful for
the beginners in this area.
