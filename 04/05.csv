of a LCDM universe especially selected to contain a rich cluster by the present
day. The properties of the dark haloes that form in these sub-solar mass
resolution simulations are presented in a companion paper by Gao et al. The
first gas clouds able to cool by molecular hydrogen line emission collapse at
extremely high redshift, z ~ 47, when the mass of the dark halo is 2.4 x 10^5
Msun/h. By z ~ 30, a substantial population of haloes are capable of undergoing
molecular hydrogen cooling although their ability to form stars is dependent on
the efficiency of feedback processes such as dissociating Lyman-Werner
radiation. The mass of the main halo grows extremely rapidly and, by z ~ 36,
its virial temperature has reached 10^4K, at which point gas cooling becomes
dominated by more effective atomic line processes. By z ~ 30, a small ``group''
of such potential galaxies will have formed unless prevented from doing so by
feedback processes. By this redshift, massive (>~ 100 Msun) population III
stars are able to ionise gas well beyond their own host halo and neighbouring
HII regions can percolate to form an ionized superbubble. Such patches would be
too widely separated to contribute significantly to reionisation at this time.
The large number density of early cooling haloes in the pre-reionised universe
raises the exciting prospect that this ultra-early generation of stars may be
observable as gamma-ray bursts or supernovae.

  http://www.imcce.fr/hosted_sites/tempsespace/archives/seminTE-29-05-2006.pps","astro-ph math.DS nlin.CD",,"  The discovery that many trans-neptunian objects exist in pairs, or binaries,
is proving invaluable for shedding light on the formation, evolution and
structure of the outer Solar system. Based on recent systematic searches it has
been estimated that up to 10% of Kuiper-belt objects might be binaries.
However, all examples discovered to-date are unusual, as compared to near-Earth
and main-belt asteroid binaries, for their mass ratios of order unity and their
large, eccentric orbits. In this article we propose a common dynamical origin
for these compositional and orbital properties based on four-body simulations
in the Hill approximation. Our calculations suggest that binaries are produced
through the following chain of events: initially, long-lived quasi-bound
binaries form by two bodies getting entangled in thin layers of dynamical chaos
produced by solar tides within the Hill sphere. Next, energy transfer through
gravitational scattering with a low-mass intruder nudges the binary into a
nearby non-chaotic, stable zone of phase space. Finally, the binary hardens
(loses energy) through a series of relatively gentle gravitational scattering
encounters with further intruders. This produces binary orbits that are well
fitted by Kepler ellipses. Dynamically, the overall process is strongly favored
if the original quasi-bound binary contains comparable masses. We propose a
simplified model of chaotic scattering to explain these results. Our findings
suggest that the observed preference for roughly equal mass ratio binaries is
probably a real effect; that is, it is not primarily due to an observational
bias for widely separated, comparably bright objects. Nevertheless, we predict
that a sizeable population of very unequal mass Kuiper-belt binaries is likely
awaiting discovery.

difference between the Fourier and the DWT (discrete wavelet transform) power
spectra provides a statistical measurement of the halos. This statistical
quantity is free from parameters related to the shape of the mass profile and
the identification scheme of halos. That is, the statistical measurement is
invariant in the sense that models with reasonably defined and selected
parameters of the halo models should yield the same difference of the Fourier
and DWT spectra. This feature is useful to extract ensemble averaged properties
of halos, which cannot be obtained with the identification of individual halo.
To demonstrate this point, we show with WIGEON hydrodynamical simulation
samples that the spectrum difference provides a quantitative measurement of the
discrepancy of the distribution of baryonic gas from that of the underlying
dark matter field within halos. We also show that the mass density profile of
halos in physical space can be reconstructed with this statistical measurement.
This profile essentially is the average over an ensemble of halos, including
well virialized halos as well as halos with significant internal substructures.
Moreover, this reconstruction is sensitive to the tail of the mass density
profile. We showed that the profile with $1/r^3$ tail gives very different
result from that of $1/r^2$. Other possible applications of this method are
discussed as well.

rotation profile and a fixed meridional flow, give a good approximation to the
large scale solar magnetic phenomena, such as the 11-year cycle or the so
called Hale's law of polarities. Nevertheless, the larger amplitude of the
radial shear at the high latitudes makes the dynamo to produce a strong
toroidal magnetic field at high latitudes, in contradiction with the
observations of the sunspots (Sporer`s Law). A possible solution was proposed
by Nandy and Choudhur (2002) in which a deep meridional flow can conduct the
magnetic field inside of a stable layer (the radiative core) and then allow
that it erupts just at lower latitudes. We have recently explored this
hypothesis in a different approximation, using the magnetic buoyancy mechanism
proposed by Dikpaty and Charbonneau (1999) and found that a deep meridional
flow pushes the maximum of the toroidal magnetic field towards the solar
equator, but, in contrast to Nandy and Choudhuri (2002), a second zone of
maximum fields remains at the poles (Guerrero and Munoz (2004)). We here review
these results and also discuss a new possible scenario where the tachocline has
an ellipsoidal shape, following early helioseismologic observations Charbonneau
et. al., (1999), and find that the modification of the geometry of the
tachocline can lead to results which are in good agreement with observations
and opens the possibility to explore in more detail, through the dynamo model,
the place where the magnetic field could be really stored.

more IR luminous galaxies tend to have smaller local galaxy density, being
consistent with the picture where luminous IRGs are created by the
merger-interaction of galaxies that happens more often in lower density
regions; (ii) the fractions of AGNs increase as a function of Lir; (iii) there
is a good correlation between Lir and L[OIII] for AGNs, suggesting both of the
parameters can be a good estimator of the total power of AGNs; (iv) a good
correlation is found between Lir and optically estimated star formation rate
(SFR) for star-forming galaxies, suggesting Lir is a good indicator of galaxy
SFR. However, caution is needed when SFR is estimated using Lir, i.e., high SFR
galaxies selected by Lir is frequently merger/interaction, whereas high SFR
galaxies selected by optical emission is often normal spiral or
Magellanic-cloud like irregular galaxies. (v) more IR luminous galaxies have
slightly larger Halpha/Hbeta ratio; (vi) more IR luminous galaxies have more
centrally-concentrated morphology, being consistent with the morphological
appearance of galaxy-galaxy merger remnants. Optical image of ultra/very

Over a wide range of models, metal enrichment is dominated by the smallest
efficient sources, as the enriched volume scales roughly as E^{3/5} ~ M^{3/5}
while the number density of sources goes as 1/M. In all cases, the earliest
sources have the biggest impact, because fixed comoving distances correspond to
smaller physical distances at higher redshifts. This means that most of the
enriched volume is found around rare peaks, and intergalactic metals are
naturally highly clustered. Furthermore, this clustering is so strong as to
lead to a large overlap between individual bubbles. Thus the typical radius of
enriched z ~ 3 regions should be interpreted as a constraint on groupings of
sources rather than the ejection radius of a typical source. Similarly, the
clustering of enriched regions should be taken as a measurement of source bias
rather than mass.

ground. The rate coefficient for capture from the continuum is obtained from
photoionization cross sections and detailed balancing, while radiative
transition probabilities determine the cascades. We have made every effort to
use today's best atomic data. Radiative decay rates are from Drake's

singlet-triplet mixing. Certain high-$L$ fine-structure levels do not have a

debris disk obtained with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS).
The disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than found
previously. The radius of the disk is at least 43"" (330 AU), 70""(543 AU), and
105"" (815 AU) in extent at 24, 70 and 160 um, respectively. The disk images are
circular, smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths. The radial
surface brightness profiles imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11""+/-2"" (86
AU). Assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, the
disk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk, viewed
face-on, with the surface particle number density following an r^-1 power law.
The disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models using
grains of sizes ~1 to ~50 um. We find that a ring, containing grains larger
than 180 um and at radii of 86-200 AU from the star, can reproduce the observed
850 um flux, while its emission does not violate the observed MIPS profiles.
This ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodies
analogous to our own Kuiper Belt. Cascades of collisions starting with
encounters amongthese large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that is
blown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detect
its thermal emission. The dust production rate is >~10^15 g/s based on the MIPS
results. This rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for the
dust to be produced in a steady state throughout Vega's life. Instead, we

repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies with

both strong radio activity observed in $\sim$14% of early type galaxies and to
supply an adequate number of SNIa progenitors to the stellar population of

distorted by errors in the energy reconstruction. Here we show that if the

than the effect of the magnitude of the error in the energy. We estimate the
UHECR spectrum at the Earth assuming it is originated from a cosmological flux.
We then convolute this flux assuming a lognormal error in the energy. We show
that if the standard deviation of the lognormal error distribution is equal or
larger than 0.25, both the shape and the normalization of the measured energy
spectra will be modified significantly. As a consequence the GZK cutoff might
be sufficiently smeared and as not to be seen. This result is independent of

algorithm can be applied in the deprojection analysis of objects with the
temperature and metallicity gradients, for correction of the PSF effects, for
consistent comparison of numerical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups

the so-called beta-model, which is an isothermal hydrostatic model often used

temperature T_vir of a cluster may be represented better by beta T_X than T_X,
where beta is the parameter obtained from the X-ray surface brightness and T_X
is the emission-weighted mean temperature of the gas. We investigate 121
clusters observed by ROSAT and ASCA and find that the luminosity-temperature
relation L_X - beta T_X is less steep than L_X - T_X. We classify the clusters
into two core-size groups in order to investigate their properties in detail.
While in the larger core group the core radius is marginally proportional to
the virial radius, no significant relation is found for the smaller core group.
This may suggest that the smaller cores reflect the presence of cD galaxies,
effect of radiative cooling or asymmetry in the surface brightness. We examine
such possibilities, and find that the clusters of smaller cores have shorter
cooling time than the Hubble time, while no significant correlation is found
with cD or asymmetry. We carry out hydrodynamical calculations to simulate the
beta-model, intending to see the behavior of the isothermal gas under the
gravitational potential including the dark matter and galaxies with or without
a central cD galaxy. Calculations show r_c \propto r_vir and T_vir \simeq beta
T consistently with our consideration to the beta-model. Also is found from
calculations that the presence of a large cD galaxy may form a gas core \sim 40
kpc, which seems too small to account for the range of the core sizes, 40--80

whether the fission affects the $r$-process paths by using the full nuclear

input dust distribution is analytically calculated by assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium between pressure forces - due to the turbulent motion of the gas
clouds - and gravitational and centrifugal forces as a result of the
contribution of the nuclear stellar distribution and the central black hole.
For a fully three-dimensional treatment of the radiative transfer problem
through the tori we employ the Monte Carlo code MC3D. We find that in
homogeneous dust distributions the observed mid-infrared emission is dominated
by the inner funnel of the torus, even when observing along the equatorial
plane. Therefore, the stratification of the distribution of dust grains - both
in terms of size and composition - cannot be neglected. In the current study we
only include the effect of different sublimation radii which significantly
alters the SED in comparison to models that assume an average dust grain
property with a common sublimation radius, and suppresses the silicate emission
feature at 9.7 micron. In this way we are able to fit the mean SED of both type
I and type II AGN very well. Our fit of special objects for which high angular
resolution observations (less than 0.3 arcseconds) are available indicates that
the hottest dust in NGC 1068 reaches the sublimation temperature while the

wavelength range, observed in second-order between 340 and 450 A. This
enhancement led to the detection of many emission lines not seen on previous
SERTS flights, which were measured with the highest spectral resolution (0.03
A) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this
wavelength range. However, even at this high spectral resolution, several of
the Fe XI lines are found to be blended, although the sources of the blends are
identified in the majority of cases. The most useful Fe XI electron density
diagnostic line intensity ratio is I(184.80 A)/I(188.21 A). This ratio involves
lines close in wavelength and free from blends, and which varies by a factor of
11.7 between N_e = 10^9 and 10^11 cm^-3, yet shows little temperature
sensitivity. An unknown line in the SERTS spectrum at 189.00 A is found to be
due to Fe XI, the first time (to our knowledge) this feature has been
identified in the solar spectrum. Similarly, there are new identifications of
the Fe XI 192.88, 198.56 and 202.42 A features, although the latter two are
blended with S VIII/Fe XII and Fe XIII, respectively.

interpret these variations as signs of concentrated chromospherically active

appear to be caused by plages moved over the visible stellar disk by rotation.
The equivalent width of the Ca K core emission changes approximately in

reconnection events. We find a hydrogen column density of NH=4.1E22 cm-2, which

nonequilibrium molecular vibrations (phonons). By a mapping to a Fokker-Planck

$\sim\lambda^{-\alpha}$ when the coupling decreases, with voltage-dependent,
non-integer exponents $\alpha$. This implies a breakdown of perturbation theory
in the electron-phonon coupling for fully developed nonequilibrium. We also
discuss possible experimental implications of this result such as

K$_{x}$Ba$_{1-x}$BiO$_{3}$ ($x \simeq 0.35$). In both compounds, vortex pinning
manifests itself as a sharp angular dependence of the \em equilibrium \rm
torque. In YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$, pinning by the defects appears at
the temperature $T_{C_{p}}^{max}$ of the specific heat maximum, well above the

tracks the onset of the specific heat anomaly and the irreversibility line. In

vanishing of pinning. In K$_{x}$Ba$_{1-x}$BiO$_{3}$, vortex pinning disappears

exhibiting a long-range elasticity along the defect. We show that as a function

the photoassociation rate at short times, and creation of correlated pairs of
atoms, confirming previous works. We also observe that the photoassociation
line shapes become asymmetric in the first-order cumulant approximation, while
they remain symmetric in the reduced pair wave approximation, giving the

correlated sources must be delivered to a single data collector node, over a
network of noisy independent point-to-point channels. We prove that perfect
reconstruction of all the sources at the sink is possible if and only if, for
all partitions of the network nodes into two subsets S and S^c such that the
sink is always in S^c, we have that H(U_S|U_{S^c}) < \sum_{i\in S,j\in S^c}
C_{ij}. Our main finding is that in this setup a general source/channel
separation theorem holds, and that Shannon information behaves as a classical
network flow, identical in nature to the flow of water in pipes. At first
glance, it might seem surprising that separation holds in a fairly general
network situation like the one we study. A closer look, however, reveals that
the reason for this is that our model allows only for independent
point-to-point channels between pairs of nodes, and not multiple-access and/or
broadcast channels, for which separation is well known not to hold. This
``information as flow'' view provides an algorithmic interpretation for our
results, among which perhaps the most important one is the optimality of
implementing codes using a layered protocol stack.

the MMSE case, the proposed design also maximizes the Gaussian mutual

noncommutative algebra A defined on a transformation groupoid given by the
action of a group G on a space E. Owing to the fact that G was assumed to be
finite it was possible to compute the model in full details. In the present
paper we develop the model in the case when G is a noncompact group. It turns
out that also in this case the model works well. The case is important since to
obtain physical effects predicted by the model we should assume that G is a
Lorentz group or some of its representations. We show that the generalized
Einstein equation of the model has the form of the eigenvalue equation for the
generalized Ricci operator, and all relevant operators in the quantum sector of
the model are random operators; we study their dynamics. We also show that the
model correctly reproduces general relativity and the usual quantum mechanics.
It is interesting that the latter is recovered by performing the measurement of
any observable. In the act of such a measurement the model ``collapses'' to the

relativity (GR) in the harmonic gauge by Futamase & Schutz (1983) is based on a
family of initial data for the matter fields of a perfect fluid and for the
initial metric, defining a family of weakly self-gravitating systems. We show
that Weinberg's (1972) expansion of the metric and his general expansion of the
energy-momentum tensor ${\bf T}$, as well as his expanded equations for the
gravitational field and his general form of the expanded dynamical equations,
apply naturally to this family. Then, following the asymptotic scheme, we
derive the explicit form of the expansion of ${\bf T}$ for a perfect fluid, and
the expanded fluid-dynamical equations. (These differ from those written by
Weinberg.) By integrating these equations in the domain occupied by a body, we
obtain a general form of the translational equations of motion for a 1PN
perfect-fluid system in GR. To put them into a tractable form, we use an
asymptotic framework for the separation parameter $\eta $, by defining a family
of well-separated 1PN systems. We calculate all terms in the equations of
motion up to the order $\eta ^3$ included. To calculate the 1PN correction
part, we assume that the Newtonian motion of each body is a rigid one, and that
the family is quasi-spherical, in the sense that in all bodies the inertia
tensor comes close to being spherical as $\eta \to 0$. Apart from corrections
that cancel for exact spherical symmetry, there is in the final equations of
motion one additional term, as compared with the Lorentz-Droste

alternative theories of gravity and to study the merger history of massive
black holes (MBH). These possibilities rely on LISA's parameter estimation
accuracy. We update previous studies of parameter estimation including
non-precessional spin effects. We work both in Einstein's theory and in
alternative theories of gravity of the scalar-tensor and massive-graviton
types. Inclusion of non-precessional spin terms in MBH binaries has little
effect on the angular resolution or on distance determination accuracy, but it
degrades the estimation of the chirp mass and reduced mass by between one and
two orders of magnitude. The bound on the coupling parameter of scalar-tensor
gravity is significantly reduced by the presence of spin couplings, while the
reduction in the graviton-mass bound is milder. LISA will measure the
luminosity distance of MBHs to better than ~10% out to z~4 for a (10^6+10^6)
Msun binary, and out to z~2 for a (10^7+10^7) Msun binary. The chirp mass of a
MBH binary can always be determined with excellent accuracy. Ignoring spin
effects, the reduced mass can be measured within ~1% out to z=10 and beyond for
a (10^6+10^6) Msun binary, but only out to z~2 for a (10^7+10^7) Msun binary.
Present-day MBH coalescence rate calculations indicate that most detectable
events should originate at z~2-6: at these redshifts LISA can be used to
measure the two black hole masses and their luminosity distance with sufficient
accuracy to probe the merger history of MBHs. If the low-frequency LISA noise
can only be trusted down to 10^-4 Hz, parameter estimation for MBHs (and LISA's
ability to perform reliable cosmological observations) will be significantly
degraded.

details of the nuclear long range interactions such as two-body currents, can

particular the deviations of off-shell effects from the longitudinal
convolution provide clear signals to be sought in experimental measurements.

hadronic structure. Generalized parton distributions are analogous to the

give an extensive review of main achievements in the development of this

generalized parton distributions, their modeling and QCD evolution in the
leading and next-to-leading orders. We describe how these functions enter a
wide class of exclusive reactions, such as electro- and photo-production of
photons, lepton pairs, or mesons. The theory of these processes requires and
implies full control over diverse corrections and thus we outline the progress
in handling higher-order and higher-twist effects. We catalogue corresponding
results and present diverse techniques for their derivations. Subsequently, we
address observables that are sensitive to different characteristics of the
nucleon structure in terms of generalized parton distributions. The ultimate
goal of the GPD approach is to provide a three-dimensional spatial picture of
the nucleon, direct measurement of the quark orbital angular momentum, and
various inter- and multi-parton correlations.

this micro-causal light cone for spacelike non-commutativite field theories
agree with the expectations from the bulk spacetime. We describe the spacetime
dual to field theories with lightlike non-commutativity, and show that they
generically have a drastic modification of the light cone in the bulk: the
spacetime is non-distinguishing. This means that the spacetime while being
devoid of closed timelike or null curves, has causal curves that are ``almost
closed''. We go on to show that the micro-causal light cone in the field theory
agrees with this prediction from the bulk.

limit, the wave function of the universe can be obtained by applying the
methods developed by Vilenkin, Hartle and Hawking. Both Vilenkin's and
Hartle-Hawking's wave function predicts nonzero cosmological constant. The
Vilenkin's wave function predicts a universe with a cosmological constant as
large as possible, while the Hartle-Hawking's wave function predicts a universe
with positive cosmological constant, which equals to $\frac{1}{\lambda}$. It is
different from Coleman's result that cosmological constant is zero, and also
different from Hawking's prediction of zero cosmological constant in quantum
cosmology with linear scalar field. We suggest that dark energy in the universe
might result from the B-I type scalar field with potential and the universe can
undergo a phase of accelerating expansion. The equation of state parameter lies
in the range of $-1<$w$<-{1/3}$. When the potential
$V(\phi)=\frac{1}{\lambda}$, our Lagrangian describes the Chaplygin gas. In

the Wilson loop twice. First we expand it in powers of the fluctuations around
a BPS loop configuration. Then we further expand each term in the result of the
first step in powers of the scalar field Z associated with the BPS
configuration. We find that each operator in this expansion with large number
of Z is the BMN operator. The number of fluctuations corresponds to the number
of impurities, and the phase factor of each BMN operator is supplied correctly.
We have to impose the BPS condition on the loop for obtaining the complete form

  Publisher. (Italy) pp.201-235",,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The tubular geometry (T-geometry) is a generalization of the proper Euclidean
geometry, founded on the property of sigma-immanence. The proper Euclidean
geometry can be described completely in terms of the world function $\sigma
=\rho ^{2}/2$, where $\rho $ is the distance. This property is called the
sigma-immanence. Supposing that any physical geometry is sigma-immanent, one
obtains the T-geometry $\mathcal{G}$, replacing the Euclidean world function
$\sigma_{E}$ by means of $\sigma $ in the sigma-immanent presentation of the
Euclidean geometry. One obtains the T-geometry $\mathcal{G}$, described by the
world function $\sigma $. This method of the geometry construction is very
simple and effective. T-geometry has a new geometric property: nondegeneracy of
geometry. The class of homogeneous isotropic T-geometries is described by a
form of a function of one parameter. Using T-geometry as the space-time
geometry one can construct the deterministic space-time geometries with
primordially stochastic motion of free particles and geometrized particle mass.
Such a space-time geometry defined properly (with quantum constant as an
attribute of geometry) allows one to explain quantum effects as a result of the
statistical description of the stochastic particle motion (without a use of
quantum principles). Geometrization of the particle mass appears to be
connected with the restricted divisibility of the straight line segments. The
statement, that the problem of the elementary particle mass spectrum is rather
a problem of geometry, than that of dynamics, is a corollary of the particle
mass geometrization.

with the purpose of studying sympatric speciation, that is, the division of a
single species into two or more populations, reproductively isolated, but
without any physical barrier separating them. For that we introduce a new kind
of competition among the individuals, using a modified Verhulst factor. The new
competition depends on some specific phenotypic characteristic of each
individual, which is represented by a pair of bitstrings. These strings are
read in parallel and have no age structure. In this way, each individual genome
consists of two parts. The first one has an age-structure and is related to the
appearance of inherited diseases; the second part is not structured and takes
into account the competition for the available resources. We also introduce
sexual selection into the model, making use of another non-structured and
independent pair of bitstrings.
  In this thesis we present three different models; two of them use, besides
the competition, a sudden change in the ecology to obtain speciation. They were
motivated by the speciation process observed in the Darwin finches, a family of
birds that inhabits the Galapagos Islands, and also by that observed in the
cichlids, a family of fish that lives in the Nicaragua Lakes and in the Vitoria
Lake, in Africa. The third model does not use any ecological change: sympatric
speciation is obtained depending only on the strength of competition among
individuals with similar phenotypic characteristics.
