  are SGRs sources of EeV CRs?","13 pages,8 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The apparently huge energy budget of the gamma ray burst GRB 990123 led to
the final collapse of the isotropic fireball model, forcing even the most
skeptical to consider a beamed Jet emission correlated to a supernova (SN)
explosion. Similarly the surprising giant flare from the soft gamma repeater
SGR 1806-20 that occurred on 2004 December 27, may induce the crisis of the
magnetar model. If the apparently huge energy associated to this flare has been
radiated isotropically, the magnetar should have consumed at once most of (if
not all) the energy stored in the magnetic field. On the contrary we think that
a thin collimated precessing jet, blazing on-axis, may be the source of such
apparently huge bursts with a moderate output power. We discuss the possible
role of the synchrotron emission and electromagnetic showering of PeV electron
pairs from muon bundles. A jet made of muons may play a key role in avoiding
the opacity of the SN-GRB radiation field. We propose a similar mechanism to
explain the emission of SGRs. In this case we also examine the possibility of a
primary hadronic jet that would produce ultra relativistic e+ e- (1 - 10 PeV)
from pion- muon or neutron decay. Such electron pairs would emit a few hundreds
keV radiation from their interaction with the galactic magnetic field, as it is
observed in the intense gamma ray flare from SGR 1806-20. A thin precessing jet
from a pulsar may naturally explain the negligible variation of the spin
frequency. A correlation between SGR 1806-20, SGR 1900 +14, Cygnus and the
AGASA excess of EeV cosmic rays (CRs) has been found; we suggest that a robust

variability from blazars to include external-radiation Compton (ERC) emission
and electron energy losses from inverse Compton scattering of seed photons
originating outside the jet. We consider seed-photon emission from a dusty
molecular torus and the broad line region (BLR) surrounding the central engine.
We establish constraints on the properties of the molecular torus and BLR under
which synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission dominates such that the results
obtained in our previous paper are applicable. The focus of this study is on
relative time delays between the light curves observed at different
frequencies. For definiteness, we consider emission resulting from a collision
between relativistic shocks, but the results apply more generally to conditions
involving acceleration of relativistic electrons and/or magnetic field
amplification at any type of front. Unlike SSC emission, ERC flares involving a
constant field of seed photons are not delayed by light travel time of the seed
photons. The main cause of delays is from radiative energy losses, which result
in frequency stratification behind the front and quench the flare first at the
highest frequencies, progressing to lower frequencies as time advances.
However, if the spectrum of electrons injected at the shock front is
characterized by a relatively high value of the minimum energy (a Lorentz
factor $\gamma_{min}\sim100$ is sufficient), the ERC flare in the X-ray band
can be delayed and may even peak after the injection has ceased. This effect is
strongly frequency dependent, with a longer lag at lower frequencies and an
X-ray spectral index that changes rapidly from positive (inverted spectrum) to
steep values.

decreasing Mach number, with the result that M=2 shocks require cooling
exponents < -1.2 to be overstable. The frequency of oscillation of the
fundamental mode has a strong Mach number dependence. We find that feedback
between the cooling region and the cold dense layer (CDL) further downstream is
a function of Mach number, with stronger feedback and oscillation of the
boundary between the CDL and the cooling region occuring at lower Mach numbers.
This feedback can be quantified in terms of the reflection coefficient of sound
waves. An interesting finding is that the stability properties of low Mach
number shocks can be dramatically altered if the shocked gas is able to cool to
temperatures less than the pre-shock value, and it is probable that low Mach
number astrophysical shocks will be overstable in a variety of situations. The
results of this work are relevant to astrophysical shocks with low Mach

medium (e.g., within a starburst region), and shocks in molecular clouds, where
time-dependent chemistry can lead to overstability. (Abridged)

association between muon enhancements at ground observed by the TUPI telescope
and transient events such as the Sun's X-ray activity. The analysis of the
observed phenomenon by using the GOES satellite archive data seems to indicate
that on most cases the Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) could potentially be
associated with solar flares. We show that small scale solar flares, those with
prompt X-ray emission classified as C class (power above $10^{-6}Watts m^{-2}$
at 1 AU) may give rise to GLEs, probably associated with solar protons and ions
arriving to the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The TUPI telescope's high
performance with these energetic solar particles arises mainly from: (1) its
high counting rate (up to $\sim 100$ KHz). This value in most cases is around
100 times higher than other detectors at ground and (2) due to its tracking
system. The telescope is always looking near the direction of the IMF lines.
The GLE's delay in relation of the X-ray prompt emission suggest that shock
driven by corona mass ejection (CME) is an essential requirement for the
particle acceleration efficiency.

allows one to distinguish between recently formed and evolved bars, as well as
estimate their ages, assuming that bars form in vertically thin disks,
recognizable by low values for the vertical velocity dispersion sigma_z.
Through N-body realizations of bar unstable disk galaxies we could also check
the time scales involved in the processes which give bars an important vertical
structure. We show that sigma_z in evolved bars is roughly around 100 Km/s,
which translates to a height scale of about 1.4 Kpc, giving support to
scenarios in which bulges form through disk material. Furthermore, the bars in
our numerical simulations have values for sigma_z generally smaller than 50
Km/s even after evolving for 2 Gyr, suggesting that a slow process is
responsible for making bars as vertically thick as we observe. We verify
theoretically that the Spitzer-Schwarzschild mechanism is quantitatively able
to explain these observations if we assume that giant molecular clouds are

and clusters, where the chances of biological material spreading from one solar
system to another is greatly enhanced (relative to the field) due to the close
proximity of the systems and lower relative velocities. These effects more than
compensate for the reduced time spent in such crowded environments. This paper
uses 300,000 Monte Carlo scattering calculations to determine the cross
sections for rocks to be captured by binaries and provides fitting formulae for
other applications. We assess the odds of transfer as a function of the
ejection speed and number of members in the birth aggregate. The odds of any
given ejected meteroid being recaptured by another solar system are relatively
low. Because the number of ejected rocks per system can be large, virtually all
solar systems are likely to share rocky ejecta with all of the other solar
systems in their birth cluster. The number of ejected rocks that carry living
microorganisms is much smaller and less certain, but we estimate that several
million rocks can be ejected from a biologically active solar system. For
typical birth environments, the capture of life bearing rocks is expected to
occur 10 -- 16,000 times per cluster (under favorable conditions), depending on
the ejection speeds. Only a small fraction of the captured rocks impact the
surfaces of terrestrial planets, so that only a few lithopanspermia events are

with other diagnostics. We estimate a mass accretion rate of
(5\pm2)\times10^{-8}$ M_\odot/yr using the optical-NUV accretion continuum. The
accreting gas is also detected in bright, broad lines of C IV, Si IV, and N V,
which all show complex structures across the line profile. Many other emission
lines, including those of H_2 and Fe II, are pumped by Ly-alpha. RU Lupi's
spectrum varies significantly in the FUV; our STIS observations occurred when
RU Lupi was brighter than several other observations in the FUV, possibly due
to a high mass accretion rate.

orbital solutions as a function of energy and angular momentum using numerical
methods. In contrast, this paper presents a number of analytic results for the

orbits have similar properties for any extended mass distribution (including,
e.g., the NFW profile). We discuss circular orbits, radial orbits, zero energy
orbits, different definitions of eccentricity, analogs of Kepler's law, the
definition of orbital elements, and the relation of these orbits to spirograph
patterns (epicycloids). Over much of parameter space the orbits can be
adequately described (with accuracy better than 10%) using the parametric
equations of epicycloids, thereby providing an analytic description of the

standard thin disks. It is believed that the initial transition radius is small
just after the accretion mode transition, and then the transition radius
increases with decreasing accretion rate, as suggested by some theoretical
models and observations. Based on such variable transition radius models, we
derive how the dimensionless accretion rate evolves with time from the observed
Eddington ratio distribution for a sample of low-luminosity active galactic
nuclei in the local universe. The derived time-dependent accretion rates show a
rapid decrease after the transition of the standard thin accretion disk to a

years in the quasar rest frame) after a previous observation with Subaru+HDS.
The new spectrum enables us to search for time variability as an identifier of
intrinsic narrow absorption lines (NALs). This quasar shows a rich complex of C
IV NALs within 60,000 km/s of the emission redshift. Based on covering factor
analysis, Misawa et al. found that the C IV NAL system at z_abs= 2.42--2.45
(System A, at a shift velocity of v_sh = 8,300--10,600 km/s relative to the
quasar) was intrinsic to the quasar. With our new spectrum, we perform time
variability analysis as well as covering factor analysis to separate intrinsic
NALs from intervening NALs for 8 C IV systems. Only System A, which was
identified as an intrinsic system in the earlier paper by Misawa et al., shows
a strong variation in line strength (W_obs ~ 10.4A -> 19.1A). We speculate that
a broad absorption line (BAL) could be forming in this quasar. We illustrate
the plausibility of this suggestion with the help of a simulation. Under the
assumption that a change of ionization state causes the variability, a lower
limit can be placed on the electron density (n_e > 3x10^4 cm^-3) and an upper
limit on the distance from the continuum source (r < 6 kpc). On the other hand,
if the motion of clumpy gas causes the variability (a more likely scenario),
the crossing velocity and the distance from the continuum source are estimated
to be v_cross > 8,000 km/s and r < 3 pc. In this case, the absorber does not
intercept any flux from the broad emission line region, but only flux from the
UV continuum source. If we adopt the dynamical model of Murray et al., we can
obtain a much more strict constraint on the distance of the gas parcel from the
continuum source, r < 0.2 pc.

participating in the angular momentum redistribution which drives the dynamical
evolution. Angular momentum is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the
bar region and is absorbed mainly by near-resonant material in the halo and in
the outer disc. This exchange determines the strength of the bar, the decrease
of its pattern speed, as well as its morphology. Thus, contrary to previous
beliefs, a halo can help the bar grow, so that bars growing in galaxies with
responsive massive haloes can become stronger than bars growing in disc
dominated galaxies. During the evolution the halo does not stay axisymmetric.
It forms a bar which is shorter and fatter than the disc bar and stays so all
through the simulation, although its length grows considerably with time. I
discuss the orbital structure in the disc and the halo and compare it with
periodic orbits in analytical barred galaxy potentials. A central mass
concentration (e.g. a central black hole, or a central disc) weakens a bar and
increases its pattern speed. The effect of the central mass concentration
depends strongly on the model, being less strong in models with a massive
concentrated halo and a strong bar.

effect is influenced by a thin non-magnetic (NM) Ta layer, deposited just below
the AlO$_x$ insulating barrier in tunnel junctions of the type FM/NM/I/FM
(FM=CoFe). Enhanced resistance switching occurs with increasing maximum applied
current ($\Imax$), until a plateau of constant CIS is reached for $\Imax\sim65$
mA (CIS$\sim$60%) and above. However, such high electrical currents also lead
to a large ($\sim$9%) irreversible resistance decrease, indicating barrier
degradation. Anomalous voltage-current characteristics with negative derivative
were also observed near $\pm\Imax$ and this effect is here attributed to
heating in the tunnel junction. One observes that the current direction for
which resistance switches in FM/NM/I/FM (clockwise) is opposite to that of
FM/I/FM tunnel junctions (anti-clockwise). This effect will be discussed in
terms of a competition between the electromigration contributions due to the so
called direct and wind forces. It will be shown that the direct force is likely
to dominate electromigration in the Ta (NM) layers, while the wind contribution
likely dominates in the CoFe (FM) layers.

previous behaviors and plays the PD with eight nearest neighbors and then
copies the behavior of who had the greatest payoff for next generation. This
system shows that, when the conflict is established, cooperation among agents
may emerge even for reasonably high defection temptation values. Contrary to
previous studies, which treat mean inter-group interaction, here a model where
the agents are not allowed to self-interact, representing intra-group
interaction, is proposed. This leads to short time and asymptotic behaviors
similar to the one found when self-interaction is considered. Nevertheless, the
intermediate behavior is different, with no possible data collapse since
oscillations are present. Also, the fluctuations are much smaller in the
intra-group model. The geometrical configurations of cooperative clusters are
distinct and explain the $\rho_c(t)$ differences between inter and intra-group

constant curvature in the asymptotic region permits the explicit construction
of such series of boundary terms. The orthonormal frame is adapted to
appropriately describe the boundary geometry and, as a result, the boundary
term can be expressed as a functional of the boundary metric, extrinsic
curvature and intrinsic curvature. This choice also allows to write down the
background-independent Noether charges associated to asymptotic symmetries in
standard tensorial formalism. The absence of the Gibbons-Hawking term is a
consequence of an action principle based on a boundary condition different than
Dirichlet on the metric. This argument makes plausible the idea of regarding
this approach as an alternative regularization scheme for AdS gravity in all
even dimensions, different than the standard counterterms prescription. As an
illustration of the finiteness of the charges and the Euclidean action in this
framework, the conserved quantities and black hole entropy for four-dimensional

truncations of the corresponding unitary multiplication operator, and the use
of the five-diagonal representation of this operator.
  Unitary truncations on subspaces with finite co-dimension give information
about the derived set of the support of the measure under very general
assumptions for the related Schur parameters. Among other results, we obtain a
natural generalization of the known result for the Lopez class.
  On the other hand, unitary truncations on subspaces with finite dimension
provide sequences of unitary five-diagonal matrices whose spectra
asymptotically approach the support of the measure. This answers a conjecture
of L. Golinskii concerning the relation between the support of the measure and
the strong limit points of the zeros of the para-orthogonal polynomials.
  Finally, we use the previous results to discuss the domain of convergence of
rational approximants of Caratheodory functions, including the convergence on
the unit circle.

of many large real-world graphs. Our model includes as special cases many

  We show that under one very weak assumption (that the expected number of
edges is `what it should be'), many properties of the model can be determined,
in particular the critical point of the phase transition, and the size of the
giant component above the transition. We do this by relating our random graphs
to branching processes, which are much easier to analyze.
  We also consider other properties of the model, showing, for example, that
when there is a giant component, it is `stable': for a typical random graph, no
matter how we add or delete o(n) edges, the size of the giant component does
not change by more than o(n).

simulation of biological tissues and morphogenesis. Both tissue physiology and
morphogenesis depend on diffusion of chemical morphogens in the extra-cellular
fluid or matrix (ECM). Standard diffusion solvers applied to the cellular potts
model use finite difference methods on the underlying CPM lattice. However,
these methods produce a diffusing field tied to the underlying lattice, which
is inaccurate in many biological situations in which cell or ECM movement
causes advection rapid compared to diffusion. Finite difference schemes suffer
numerical instabilities solving the resulting advection-diffusion equations. To
circumvent these problems we simulate advection-diffusion within the framework
of the CPM using off-lattice finite-difference methods. We define a set of
generalized fluid particles which detach advection and diffusion from the
lattice. Diffusion occurs between neighboring fluid particles by local
averaging rules which approximate the Laplacian. Directed spin flips in the CPM
handle the advective movement of the fluid particles. A constraint on relative
velocities in the fluid explicitly accounts for fluid viscosity. We use the CPM
to solve various diffusion examples including multiple instantaneous sources,
continuous sources, moving sources and different boundary geometries and
conditions to validate our approximation against analytical and established
numerical solutions. We also verify the CPM results for Poiseuille flow and
Taylor-Aris dispersion.

geometries, we embed two subunits of each species into their native
lipid-bilayer/water environment. Using molecular dynamics simulations with
umbrella sampling and steered molecular dynamics, we probe the free energy
profiles along two reaction coordinates, the angle and the distance between two
subunits. We find that two subunits prefer to arrange at distinctly different
angles, depending on the species, at about 42.5 deg for Rs. molischianum and at
about 38.5 deg for Rps. acidophila, which is likely to be an important factor
contributing to the assembly into different ring sizes. Our calculations
suggest a key role of surface contacts within the transmembrane domain in
constraining these angles, whereas the strongest interactions stabilizing the
subunit dimers are found in the C-, and to a lesser extent, N-terminal domains.
The presented computational approach provides a promising starting point to
investigate the factors contributing to the assembly of protein complexes, in
particular if combined with modeling of genetic variants.

the statistical properties of earthquakes depend on the frictional and elastic
properties of earthquake faults. It is found that, as the velocity-weakening
tendency of the friction force gets weaker, the system tends to be more
critical, while, as the velocity-weakening tendency gets stronger, the system
tends to be more off-critical with enhanced features of a characteristic
earthquake. The model exhibits several eminent precursory phenomena prior to
the large event in its spatio-temporal correlations. Preceding the mainshock,
the frequency of smaller events is gradually enhanced, whereas, just before the
mainshock, it is suppressed in a close vicinity of the epicenter of the
upcoming event (the Mogi doughnut). The time scale of the onset of the
doughnut-like quiescence depends on the extent of the frictional instability.
Under certain conditions, preceding the mainshock, the apparent B-value of the
magnitude distribution increases significantly. The existence of such distinct
precursory phenomena may open a way to the prediction of the time and the

index aerogel radiator allows for an increase in Cherenkov photon yield on
account of the increase in overall radiator thickness, while avoiding the
simultaneous degradation in single photon angular resolution associated with
the increased uncertainty of the emission point. With the refractive index of
consecutive layers suitably increasing in the downstream direction, one may
achieve overlapping of the Cherenkov rings from a single charged particle. In
the opposite case of decreasing refractive index, one may obtain well separated
rings. In the former combination an approximately 40% increase in photon yield

solution, the significant features of the entanglement when a second qubit is
weakly coupled to the field and becomes entangled with the first qubit, is
investigated. We also describe the response of the atomic system as it varies
between the Rabi oscillations and the collapse-revival mode and investigate the
atomic inversion and the Q-function. We identify and numerically demonstrate
the region of parameters where significantly large entanglement can be
obtained. Most interestingly, it is shown that features of the entanglement is
influenced significantly when the multi-photon process is involved. Finally, we
obtain illustrative examples of some novel aspects of this system and show how
the off-resonant case can sensitize entanglement to the role of initial state
setting.

have analyzed the quantum theory of the mazer in the off-resonant case.
However, our analysis of this case refutes their claim by showing that their
evaluation of the coupled equations for the off-resonant case is not
satisfactory. The correct expression can be obtained by applying an appropriate
formulae for the involved dressed-state parameters.

any SU(2) polarization transformation. This requirement fully characterizes the
set of density matrices representing unpolarized states. We introduce the
degree of polarization of a quantum state as its distance to the set of
unpolarized states. We use two different candidates of distance, namely the
Hilbert-Schmidt and the Bures metric, showing that they induce fundamentally
different degrees of polarization. We apply these notions to relevant field
states and we demonstrate that they avoid some of the problems arising with the
classical definition.

both the entanglement and total correlation of the stationary state of two

influence of collective dephasing on entanglement of two qutrits and obtain the
sufficient condition that the stationary state is entangled.
