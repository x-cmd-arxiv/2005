variations of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in the spectra of

by systematic effects. The $\alpha$ values estimated in individual line systems
depend on the set of atomic transitions used and therefore the quoted
dependence on the cosmic age may reflect the fact that different sets of
transitions are used at different redshifts. A correlation between line shifts
and relative optical depths of the atomic transitions is also present. This
correlation is very tight for a high-redshift subsample and accounts for the
anomalous dispersion of the $\alpha$ values found by Murphy et al. (2003a) in
this subsample. The above correlations are consistent with a scenario in which
gravitational redshift, caused by the gravity of the dark halo, contributes to
the shift in frequency of individual components. Gravitational redshift causes
differential spectral shifts of the same order as magnitude of those measured.
In the presence of line misidentification, these shifts can be interpreted in
terms of a variable $\alpha$. In order to verify the gravitational redshift
hypothesis, a direct access to Murphy et al. (2003a) data, or to a large amount
of new high resolution data, is necessary.

both hot (Luminous Blue Variable and extreme B supergiants) and cool (Yellow
Hypergiant and Red Supergiant) objects - we find that half the known Galactic

=-5 (O7 V or later). Based solely on the masses inferred for the 53

confusion and incompleteness are likely to render this an underestimate. As
such, Wd 1 is the most massive compact young cluster yet identified in the

that the UV emissivity at $7 \leq z \leq 12$ can make a noticeable contribution

required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter at $7 \leq z \leq 12$.
However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from Pop III objects is
smaller than 10%, then the IGM can be neutralized at some redshift, which may
lead to the double reionization. As for the enrichment, the ejection of all

Antonow's rule is confirmed and, with the aid of previously studied {\it

and confirms the expected lack of symmetry in $(T-T_c)$. A searching test of

finite Luttinger liquid (LL) connected to electrodes is to match load and drain
impedances to the characteristic impedance of the LL viewed as a mesoscopic
transmission line. For an impedance matched LL, this implies that the AC and DC
shot noise properties of a finite LL are identical to those of an infinite LL.
Even for an impedance mismatched LL, we show by a careful analysis of
reflections that the intrinsic infinite LL properties can still be extracted
yielding possibly irrational charges for the LL elementary excitations. We
improve on existing results for AC shot noise by deriving expressions with
explicit dependence on the charges of the fractional states. Most notably these
results can be established quite straightforwardly without resort to the
Keldysh technique. We apply these arguments to two experimental setups which
allow the observation of different sets of fractional quasiparticles: (i)
injection of current by a STM tip in the bulk of a LL; (ii) backscattering of
current by an impurity. An Appendix reviews pedagogically the 'fractional

vulnerabilities, such as through the detection of relationships between
seemingly disjoint entities. A structure used for this task is a ""semantic
graph"", also known as a ""relational data graph"" or an ""attributed relational
graph"". These graphs encode relationships as ""typed"" links between a pair of
""typed"" nodes. Indeed, semantic graphs are very similar to semantic networks
used in AI. The node and link types are related through an ontology graph (also
known as a schema). Furthermore, each node has a set of attributes associated
with it (e.g., ""age"" may be an attribute of a node of type ""person"").
Unfortunately, the selection of types and attributes for both nodes and links
depends on human expertise and is somewhat subjective and even arbitrary. This
subjectiveness introduces biases into any algorithm that operates on semantic
graphs. Here, we raise some knowledge representation issues for semantic graphs
and provide some possible solutions using recently developed ideas in the field
of complex networks. In particular, we use the concept of transitivity to
evaluate the relevance of individual links in the semantic graph for detecting
relationships. We also propose new statistical measures for semantic graphs and

efficient and robust service discovery and data-access mechanisms are both
essential and challenging. Rendezvous-based mechanisms provide a valuable
solution for provisioning a wide range of services. In this paper, we describe
Rendezvous Regions (RRs) - a novel scalable rendezvous-based architecture for
wireless networks. RR is a general architecture proposed for service location
and bootstrapping in ad hoc networks, in addition to data-centric storage,
configuration, and task assignment in sensor networks. In RR the network
topology is divided into geographical regions, where each region is responsible
for a set of keys representing the services or data of interest. Each key is
mapped to a region based on a hash-table-like mapping scheme. A few elected
nodes inside each region are responsible for maintaining the mapped
information. The service or data provider stores the information in the
corresponding region and the seekers retrieve it from there. We run extensive
detailed simulations, and high-level simulations and analysis, to investigate
the design space, and study the architecture in various environments including
node mobility and failures. We evaluate it against other approaches to identify
its merits and limitations. The results show high success rate and low overhead
even with dynamics. RR scales to large number of nodes and is highly robust and
efficient to node failures. It is also robust to node mobility and location
inaccuracy with a significant advantage over point-based rendezvous mechanisms.

the branching ratio $W^- \to \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ with respect to the electrons

$W^-\ell\bar \nu_\ell$ is the pure left-handed charge-current which has been
tested precisely already, at least for the first two generation fermions, and
(2) the $W^\pm$ two-body leptonic decay is the cleanest one among three
anomalies due to its simpler kinematics and less hadronic uncertainties. In
this paper, we explore the possibilities to account for the anomaly in type II
two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) and minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM), as well
as effective lagrangian approach by introducing anomalous left- and
right-handed $W^-\tau \bar\nu_\tau$ couplings. Our results show that 2HDM and
MSSM can hardly accommodate $W^- \to \tau \nu_\tau$ anomaly, and the anomaly is
only marginally consistent to the measurements of $\tau \to \nu_\tau \ell \bar
\nu_\ell$ at 95% confidence level with the presence of anomalous couplings. In
the allowed regions, the right-handed coupling of $W^-\tau \nu_\tau$ shifts
from 0 in SM to $\sim 0.12$ while the left-handed one from 1 to $\sim 1.005$.

colored Jones function of a knot satisfies a non-trivial linear q-difference
equation. Said differently, the colored Jones function of a knot is annihilated
by a non-zero ideal of the Weyl algebra which is generalted (after
localization) by the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot.
  In that paper, it was conjectured that this polynomial (which has to do with
representations of the quantum group U_q(SL_2)) specializes at q=1 to the
better known A-polynomial of a knot, which has to do with genuine SL_2(C)
representations of the knot complement.
  Computing the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot is a difficult task
which so far has been achieved for the two simplest knots. In the present
paper, we introduce the C-polynomial of a knot, along with its non-commutative
version, and give an explicit computation for all twist knots. In a forthcoming
paper, we will use this information to compute the non-commutative A-polynomial
of twist knots. Finally, we formulate a number of conjectures relating the A,

goal of the paper is to solve an inverse boundary value problem for

material is conformal, i.e., the electric permittivity $\epsilon$ and magnetic
permeability $\mu$ are tensors satisfying $\mu =\alpha^2\epsilon$. This
condition is equivalent to a single propagation speed of waves with different
polarizations which uniquely defines an underlying Riemannian structure. The
analysis is based on an invariant formulation of the system of electrodynamics
as a Dirac type first order system on a Riemannian $3-$manifold with an
additional structure of the wave impedance, $(M,g,\alpha)$, where $g$ is the
travel-time metric. We study the properties of this system in the first part of

determination of $(M,g,\alpha)$ from measurements done only on an open part of

that each successful event introduces an ideal redundant graph edge, which
growth strategies should exploit. For example, if each EO succeeds with

of only about ten EO attempts per graph edge. The BK scheme then becomes

mechanics requires that no `physical' reality can be ascribed to the wave
nature of the photon. The NAFL theory QM, formalizing quantum mechanics, treats
the superposed state ($S$) of a single photon taking two or more different
paths at the same time as a logical contradiction that is formally unprovable
in QM. Nevertheless, in a nonclassical NAFL model for QM in which the law of
noncontradiction fails, $S$ has a meaningful metamathematical interpretation
that the classical path information for the photon is not available. It is
argued that the existence of an interference pattern does not logically amount
to a proof of the self-interference of a single photon. This fact, when coupled
with the temporal nature of NAFL truth, implies the logical validity of the
retroactive assertion of the path information (and the logical superfluousness
of the grid) in Afshar's experiment. The Bohr complementarity principle, when
properly interpreted with the time dependence of logical truth taken into
account, holds in Afshar's experiment. NAFL supports, but not demands, a
metalogical reality for the particle nature of the photon even when the
semantics of QM requires the state $S$.
