of galaxy clusters. Multi-frequency arcminute-resolution SZ observations can,
in principle, determine each cluster's gas temperature (T_e), bulk velocity
(v_pec), and optical depth (tau). However, the frequency bands and detector
sensitivity employed by upcoming surveys will generally not be sufficient to
disentangle the degeneracy between these three cluster parameters, even in the
absence of SZ signal contamination from point sources and imperfect primary
microwave background subtraction. Assuming contaminants can be removed, we find
that near-future SZ surveys will be able to constrain well two cluster gas
parameters that are linear combinations of tau*T_e, tau*v_z, and tau*T_e^2.
Because the SZ intensity shift is nearly a linear function of tau*T_e, tau*v_z,
and tau*T_e^2, a correspondence exists between the two effective gas parameters
that SZ surveys can constrain and simple line-of-sight integrals through the
three dimensional cluster. We illustrate the parameter constraints and
correspondence to line-of-sight integrals using 3D Nbody + hydro cluster
simulations and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We show that adding an
independent T_e measurement to upcoming SZ data breaks the parameter
degeneracy. The cluster effective velocity thus constrained is approximately
the optical-depth-weighted velocity integrated along the cluster line of sight.
A temperature prior with an error as large as 2 keV still gives bulk velocity
errors < 100 km/sec, even for a more typical cluster with an electron
temperature of 3 keV, for ACT-like SZ observations in the absence of signal
contamination. The Markov chain constraints on v_pec and tau are more
encouraging and likely more accurate than those obtained from Fisher matrices.

NICMOS/NIC2 in the F110W (J) and F160W (H) near-infrared (NIR) filters and
interpreted with the synthetic color-magnitude diagram method. The galaxy
experienced a complex star formation (SF) activity. The best fit to the data is
found by assuming three episodes of activity in the last 1-2 Gyr. The most
recent and strong episode constrained by these NIR data started ~37 Myr ago and
ended ~13 Myr ago, although we cannot exclude the possibility that up to three
SF episodes occurred in this time interval. The average star-formation rate
(SFR) of the episode is 3.2 Msun yr-1 kpc-2, in agreement with literature data.
A previous episode produced stars between 150 Myr and 40 Myr ago, with a mean
SFR about 2/3 lower than the mean SFR of the youngest episode. An older SF
episode occurred about 1 Gyr ago. All these SFRs are 2-3 orders of magnitude
higher than those derived for late-type dwarfs of the Local Group. In all cases
an initial mass function similar to Salpeter's allows for a good reproduction
of the data, but we cannot exclude flatter mass functions. These results have
been obtained adopting a distance of 2.2 Mpc and a reddening E(B-V)=0.56. A
larger distance would require younger episodes and higher SFRs. We have
explored some possible scenarios using the astrated mass in the best fit model,
in order to constrain the past star formation history. We cannot rule out a low
rate in the past SF but we can safely conclude that the last 1-2 Gyr have been
peculiar.

systems. Previously unpublished ROSAT HRI data are also presented. The point
source population and the hot diffuse gas in this system are investigated, and
compared with other merging galaxy pairs. 16 X-ray point sources are detected
in Arp 270, 7 of which are classified as ULXs (Lx > 10^39 erg/s). From spectral
fits and the age of the system it seems likely that these are predominantly
high mass X-ray binaries. The diffuse gas emits at a global temperature of ~0.5
keV, consistent with temperatures observed in other interacting systems, and we
see no evidence of the starburst-driven hot gaseous outflows seen in more
evolved systems such as The Mice and The Antennae. It is likely that these
features are absent from Arp 270 as the gas has had insufficient time to break
out of the galaxy disks. 32% of the luminosity of Arp 270 arises from the
diffuse gas in the system, this is low when compared to later stage merging
systems and gives further credence that this is an early stage merger.
Comparing the ULX population of Arp 270 to other merging systems, we derive a
relationship between the star formation rate of the system, indicated by Lfir,
and the number (N(ULX)) and luminosity (Lulx) of its ULX population. We find
Nulx proportional to Lfir^0.18 and Lulx proportional to Lfir^0.54. These
relationships, coupled with the relation of the point source X-ray luminosity
(Lxp) to Lk and Lfir+uv (Colbert et al. 2003), indicate that the ULX sources in
an interacting system have contributions from both the old and young stellar
populations.

the flux within 2R_P, with the inverted Petrosian index 1/eta(R_P)=0.2) can
represent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside of
the Petrosian aperture (2R_P). The size of this flux deficit varies
monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., its
concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R^{1/4} profile, the deficit is
0.20 mag; for an R^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide
a simple method for recovering total (Sersic) magnitudes from Petrosian
magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R_90/R_50 or R_80/R_20) within
the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that Sersic's model
provides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. We show how the
concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective
half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface
brightness. Our technique is applied to the SDSS DR2 Petrosian parameters,
yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean

angular momentum transport on the periastron distance, the relative mass of the
encountering stars and eccentricity of the encounter is investigated in detail.
This is done for prograde and retrograde coplanar encounters as well as
non-coplanar encounters. For distant coplanar encounters our simulation results
agree with the analytical approximation of the angular momentum loss by
Ostriker(1994). However, for close or high-mass encounters, significant
differences to this approximation are found. This is especially so in the case
of retrograde encounters, where the analytical result predict no angular
momentum loss regardless of the periastron distance whereas the simulations
find up to ~ 20% loss for close encounters. For the non-coplanar case a more
complex dependency on the inclination between orbital path and disc plane is
found than for distant encounters. For the coplanar prograde case new fitting
formulae for the mass and angular momentum loss are obtained, which cover the
whole range from grazing to distant encounters. In addition, the final disc
size and the mass exchange between discs is examined, demonstrating that for
equal mass stars in encounters as close as 1.5 the disc radius, the disc size

"astro-ph/0504292","Subharthi Ray","Monika Sinha, Subharthi Ray, Mira Dey and Jishnu Dey","Strange stars and superbursts at near-Eddington mass accretion rates",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  Careful assessment of four good superburst candidates for GX 17+2 reveals
that superburst is possible at near Eddington mass accretion rates. For the
other seven stars, where superburst is found, there is the standard model of
burning accumulated carbon from normal type I bursts of the accreting stars.
However, there is the need for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen mass fraction
(Z_{CNO}) which must be larger than Z_{CNO,\odot}, where the latter refers to
the standard value found in the sun. Also it is very difficult to incorporate
GX 17+2 into the standard picture of superbursts. In case of superbursts from
strange stars, arising from broken quark pairs going over to diquarks at the
surface of the star, these problems do not arise. Furthermore there is a
natural explanation for the large value of ~ 1000 for \alpha which is defined
in the literature as the ratio of energy released between normal bursts to the
energy released during the normal burst. In the scenario for superbursts in
strange stars it may be argued that the relatively smaller value of \alpha of ~
440 indicates frequent recurrence of superbursts which is reflected in 4U
1636-53.

pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 80 using a {\sl

components of a ram-pressure confined PWN embedded in the SNR ejecta: a point
source representing the pulsar, X-ray emission from the bow shock, a luminous
X-ray tail, a 30$\arcsec$ diameter plateau whose northwestern part is absent,
and the outside more diffuse X-ray emission. The plateau is just surrounded by
the radio, [O III], [S II], and [N II] shells, and the outside diffuse emission
is mostly within the H${\alpha}$ shells. While the spectra of all the features
are well fitted with power law models, a power law plus blackbody model can fit
the spectrum of the pulsar significantly better than using a power law model
alone. Generally the spectra of these components obey the trend of steepening
from the inside to the outside. However, the edge of the plateau probably has a
harder spectrum than that of the central region of the plateau. The cause of
the apparent hard spectrum of the plateau edge is unclear, and we speculate
that it might be due to a shock between the PWN and the SNR ejecta. The
possible blackbody radiation component from the pulsar has a temperature of
0.13$\pm0.02$ keV and an equivalent emitting radius of 2.2$^{+1.4}_{-0.8}$ (d/2
kpc) km, and is thus probably from the hot spots on the pulsar. We also show in
this paper that the blackbody temperature of the entire surface of PSR B1951+32
is much lower than those predicted by the standard neutron star cooling models.

emission is originating in a ~0.34pc diameter spherical volume expanding at
<=12km/s which is surrounded, and partially coincident with an [O III] emitting
inner shell expanding at 12km/s. The bright helical structure surrounding this
inner region is modelled as a bi-polar nebula with lobe expansions of 25km/s
whose axis is tilted at 37deg to the sight line but with a toroidal waist
itself expanding at 14 km/s. These observations are compared with the
expectations of the interacting two winds model for the formation of PNe. Only
after the fast wind has switched off could this global velocity structure be
generated. Ablated flows must complicate any interpretation. It is suggested
that the clumpy nature of much of the material could play a part in creating
the radial `spokes' shown here to be apparently present close to the central
star. These `spokes' could in fact be the persistant tails of cometary globules
whose heads have now photo-evaporated completely. A halo arc projecting from
the north-east of the bright core has a conterpart to the south-east. Anomolies
in the position-velocity arrays of line profiles could suggest that these are
part of an expanding disc not aligned with the central helical structure though
expanding bi-polar lobes along a tilted axis are not ruled out.

leading to a coexistence of a droplet rich isotropic phase with a droplet poor

pretransitional fluctuations in 5CB molecular orientation and in the
nanodroplet concentration. The observed phase behavior supports the notion that
the nanosized droplets, while large enough for their statistical behavior to be
probed via light scattering, are also small enough to act as impurities,
disturbing the local orientational ordering of the liquid crystal and thus
experiencing pretransitional attractive interaction mediated by paranematic

complexity classes, as opposed to interactive proof classes such as MIP and
MA-EXP. For Vinodchandran showed, by a nonrelativizing argument, that PP does
not have circuits of size n^k for any fixed k. We present an alternative proof
of this fact, which shows that PP does not even have quantum circuits of size
n^k with quantum advice. To our knowledge, this is the first nontrivial lower
bound on quantum circuit size.
  Second, we study a beautiful algorithm of Bshouty et al. for learning Boolean
circuits in ZPP^NP. We show that the NP queries in this algorithm cannot be
parallelized by any relativizing technique, by giving an oracle relative to
which ZPP^||NP and even BPP^||NP have linear-size circuits. On the other hand,
we also show that the NP queries could be parallelized if P=NP. Thus, classes
such as ZPP^||NP inhabit a ""twilight zone,"" where we need to distinguish
between relativizing and black-box techniques. Our results on this subject have
implications for computational learning theory as well as for the circuit
minimization problem.

identically distributed (i.i.d.) sources are derived. A pattern is a sequence
of indices that contains all consecutive integer indices in increasing order of
first occurrence. If the alphabet of a source that generated a sequence is
unknown, the inevitable cost of coding the unknown alphabet symbols can be
exploited to create the pattern of the sequence. This pattern can in turn be
compressed by itself. The bounds derived here are functions of the i.i.d.
source entropy, alphabet size, and letter probabilities. It is shown that for
large alphabets, the pattern entropy must decrease from the i.i.d. one. The
decrease is in many cases more significant than the universal coding redundancy
bounds derived in prior works. The pattern entropy is confined between two
bounds that depend on the arrangement of the letter probabilities in the
probability space. For very large alphabets whose size may be greater than the
coded pattern length, all low probability letters are packed into one symbol.
The pattern entropy is upper and lower bounded in terms of the i.i.d. entropy
of the new packed alphabet. Correction terms, which are usually negligible, are
provided for both upper and lower bounds.

recurrent neural networks are able take into account of a context in document.
To be useful for data mining, self-organizing neural network techniques of

Newton-Einstein gravity due to the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld
model. The Gauss perturbative scheme is used. It turns out that the argument of
pericentre and the mean anomaly are affected by secular rates which are
independent of the semimajor axis of the orbit of the test particle. The first
nonvaishing eccentricity-dependent corrections are of order O(e^2). For
circular orbits the Lue-Starkman (LS) effect on the pericentre is obtained.
Some observational consequences are discussed for the Solar System planetary
mean longitudes lambda which would undergo a 1.2\cdot 10^-3 arcseconds per
century braneworld secular precession. According to recent data analysis over
92 years for the EPM2004 ephemerides, the 1-sigma formal accuracy in

while the braneworld effect over the same time span would be 1.159

century systematic error due to the mismodelling in the Keplerian mean motion
of Mars. A suitable linear combination of the mean longitudes of Mars and Venus
may overcome this problem. The formal, 1-sigma obtainable observational
accuracy would be \sim 7%. The systematic error due to the present-day
uncertainties in the solar quadrupole mass moment, the Keplerian mean motions,
the general relativistic Schwarzschild field and the asteroid ring would amount
to some tens of percent.

constrains the parameter space of supersymmetric models in general, and of the

distribution. The family F_w(s) of distribution functions have been obtained
before by Baik and Rains in the context of the PNG model with boundary sources,
which requires the asymptotics of a Riemann-Hilbert problem. In our work we
arrive at F_w(s) through the asymptotics of a Fredholm determinant. F_w(s) is
simply related to the scaling function for the space-time covariance of the
stationary TASEP, equivalently to the asymptotic transition probability of a
single second class particle.

equivalence of categories between the category of etale adic formal schemes
over a noetherian formal scheme (X, O_X) and the category of etale schemes over
the ordinary scheme (X, O_X/I), with I an Ideal of definition. These results
characterize completely the local behavior of formally smooth pseudo finite

this paper we propose a new process to produce quantum fusion modules from it :

a new (non semi-simple) tensor category Mod. For quantum affine algebras this
process is new and different from the usual tensor product. For general quantum
affinizations, for example for toroidal algebras, so far, no process to produce
fusion modules was known. We derive several applications from it : we construct
the fusion of (finitely many) arbitrary l-highest weight modules, and prove
that it is always cyclic. We establish exact sequences involving fusion of
Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules related to new T-systems. Eventually for a large
class of quantum affinizations we prove that the subcategory of finite length
modules of Mod is stable under the new monoidal bifunctor.

unsteady diffusion in a random medium. The diffusivity of the medium is modeled
as a random field with short correlation length, and the governing equations
are cast in the form of stochastic differential equations. A detailed
fine-scale computation of such a problem requires discretization and solution
of a large system of equations, and can be prohibitively time-consuming. To
circumvent this difficulty, we propose an equation-free approach, where the
fine-scale computation is conducted only for a (small) fraction of the overall
time. The evolution of a set of appropriately defined coarse-grained variables
(observables) is evaluated during the fine-scale computation, and ``projective
integration'' is used to accelerate the integration. The choice of these coarse
variables is an important part of the approach: they are the coefficients of
pointwise polynomial expansions of the random solutions. Such a choice of
coarse variables allows us to reconstruct representative ensembles of
fine-scale solutions with ""correct"" correlation structures, which is a key to
algorithm efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrating accuracy and efficiency
of the approach are presented.

limited by an ATP-dependent step at low load and a force-dependent step at high
load, and that at least one step is effectively irreversible in the measured
range of forces. The irreversible nature of the sub-step(s) lead to interesting
predictions for future experiments: We find different parameterizations with
mathematically identical force velocity relations but different fluctuations

technique for calculation of light propagation in photonic crystal structures.
The advantage of this method in comparison to the conventional
finite-difference time domain (FDTD) technique is that it computes Green's
function of the photonic structure recursively by adding slice by slice on the
basis of Dyson's equation. This eliminates the need for storage of the wave
function in the whole structure, which obviously strongly relaxes the memory
requirements and enhances the computational speed. The second advantage of this
method is that it can easily account for the infinite extension of the
structure both into the air and into the space occupied by the photonic crystal
by making use of the so-called ""surface Green's functions"". This eliminates the
spurious solutions (often present in the conventional FDTD methods) related to
e.g. waves reflected from the boundaries defining the computational domain. The
developed method has been applied to study scattering and propagation of the
electromagnetic waves in the photonic band-gap structures including cavities
and waveguides. A particular attention has been paid to surface modes residing
on a termination of a semi-infinite photonic crystal. We demonstrate that
coupling of the surface states with incoming radiation may result in enhanced

refers to a theory built on three foundations: relativity principles, the
original Maxwell's equations, and the mathematics of exterior calculus. In this
theory of electromagnetism the general laws are expressed as geometric
(coordinate-free) relations between quantities on a four-dimensional spacetime
manifold. Based on these laws, and exterior calculus on metric spaces, we
derive fields and relations that describe electromagnetism from the inside
perspective of Lorentz observers, inside the Minkowski spacetime (the ordinary
flat spacetime). It is shown how fields and relations defined on the spacetime
are sliced into three-dimensional fields and relations on time slices, and that
Lorentz observers perceive these as time-dependent fields and relations on a
single three-dimensional Euclidean space. In exterior calculus (on metric
spaces) each field is associated to four field variants from which one can
choose how a field is to appear. Using this feature, we derive alternative
equation systems describing electromagnetism from the inside perspective. In
one system, A, all field quantities are form fields. In another system, C, the
fields are represented as vector and scalar fields. But in contrast to the
traditional Maxwell's equations with div and curl operators, there is here no
need for pseudo-vectors and pseudo-scalars. Some theorems of a pseudo-free
vector analysis, adapted to the C-system, are derived. The paper concludes with
a section where we analyse properties of the electromagnetic field and its laws

re-accelerating of slow-light solitons in atomic media in the nonadiabatic
regime. Dynamical control over slow-light solitons is realized via a
controlling field generated by an auxiliary laser. For a rather general time
dependence of the field; we find the dynamics of the slow-light soliton inside
the medium. We provide an analytical description for the nonlinear dependence
of the velocity of the signal on the controlling field. If the background field
is turned off at some moment of time, the signal stops. We find the location
and shape of the spatially localized memory bit imprinted into the medium. We
discuss physically interesting features of our solution, which are in a good
agreement with recent experiments.

of quantum computation, in which coherent quantum information processing is
accomplished via a sequence of single-qubit measurements applied to a fixed
quantum state known as a cluster state. We also discuss a few novel properties
of the model, including a proof that the cluster state cannot occur as the
exact ground state of any naturally occurring physical system, and a proof that
measurements on any quantum state which is linearly prepared in one dimension
can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, and thus are not
candidates for use as a substrate for quantum computation.
