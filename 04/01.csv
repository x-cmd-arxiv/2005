  analysis","16 pages, 8 figures, accepted in A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  As most exoplanets host stars, HD 160691 (alias mu Ara) presents a
metallicity excess in its spectrum compared to stars without detected planets.
This excess may be primordial, in which case the star would be completely
overmetallic, or it may be due to accretion in the early phases of planetary
formation, in which case it would be overmetallic only in its outer layers. As
discussed in a previous paper (Bazot and Vauclair 2004), seismology can help
choosing between the two scenarios. This star was observed during eight nights
with the spectrograph HARPS at La Silla Observatory. Forty three p-modes have
been identified (Bouchy et al. 2005). In the present paper, we discuss the
modelisation of this star. We computed stellar models iterated to present the
same observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical
composition) while the internal structure was different according to the two
extreme assumptions : original overmetallicity or accretion. We show that in
any case the seismic constraints lead to models in complete agreement with the
external parameters deduced from spectroscopy and from the Hipparcos parallax
(L and Teff). We discuss the tests which may lead to a choice between the two
typical scenarios. We show that the ``small separation'' seem to give a better
fit for the accretion case than for the overmetallic case, but in spite of the
very good data the uncertainties are still too large to conclude. We discuss
the observations which would be needed to go further and solve this question.

result, resonances between the bar and the disk become an important factor. In
order to detect resonances, we measure angular and radial frequencies of
individual orbits in N-body models of barred galaxies. In our simulations with
several million particles, stellar disks are immersed in live halos of dark
matter. A bar forms spontaneously and interacts with the disk through
resonances. We detect 9 of them. The corotation (CR) and the inner Lindblad
resonance (ILR) are the most significant. The spatial distributions of
particles trapped at these resonances show that ILR is not localized at a given
radius. Particles trapped at ILR lie along the bar spanning a wide range of
radii. On the other hand, particles at the corotation resonance form a ring
around the corotation radius. We study how orbits evolve near corotation and
how they are trapped. When an orbit is getting trapped, it evolves strongly,
but after that there is little evolution. Those trapped orbits circulate along
the corotation ring or librate around a stable lagragian point. The same
technique is applied to study resonances in the halo. The bar interacts
strongly with the halo particles that stay close to the disk. We find the
corotation resonance and the inner Lindblad resonance for halo particles.

These vortical modes inturn leave a characteristic imprint on the temperature

re-scatterred after recombination. Observations from WMAP indicate that the
Universe underwent a relatively early re-ionization ($z_{ri} \sim 15$), which
does indeed lead to a significant optical depth for re-scattering of CMB
photons after the re-ionization epoch. We compute the resulting additional
temperature anisotropies, induced by primordial magnetic fields in the

nearly scale-invariant spectrum of tangled magnetic fields which redshift to a

the power spectra in the chi state are typical to the very high/intermediate
state of black-hole binaries. The spectrum of the omega state is characterized
by a strong blackbody component Comptonized by thermal electrons and a weak
nonthermal tail. We then calculate rms spectra (fractional variability as
functions of energy) for the PCA data. We accurately model the rms spectra by
coherent superposition of variability in the components implied by the spectral
fits, namely a less variable blackbody and more variable Comptonization. The
latter dominates at high energies, resulting in a flattening of the rms at high
energies in most of the data. This is also the case for the spectra of the QPOs
present in the chi state. Then, some of our data require a radial dependence of
the rms of the disc blackbody. We also study the distance to the source, and

should possess highly eccentric orbits. This leads to greatly accelerated
orbital decay, due to the enormous increase in the emission of gravitational
radiation at periastron as originally demonstrated by Peters (1964). A uniform
distribution of kick velocities constrained to the orbital plane would result
in ~24% of surviving binaries coalescing at least 10,000 times faster than an
unperturbed circular system. Even if the planar kick constraint is lifted, ~6%
of bound systems still coalesce this rapidly. In a non-negligible fraction of
cases it may even be possible that the system could coalesce within 10 years of
the final supernova, resulting in what we might term a ""double supernova''. For
systems resembling the progenitor of PSR J0737-3039A, this number is as high as
\~9% (in the planar kick model). Whether the kick velocity distribution extends
to the range required to achieve this is still unclear. We do know that the
observed population of binary pulsars has a deficit of highly eccentric systems
at small orbital periods. In contrast, the long-period systems favour large
eccentricities, as expected. We argue that this is because the short-period
highly eccentric systems have already coalesced and are thus selected against
by pulsar surveys. This effect needs to be taken into account when using the
scale-factor method to estimate the coalescence rate of double neutron star
binaries. We therefore assert that the coalesence rate of such binaries is
underestimated by a factor of several.

offers a quantitative implementation of Occam's razor.
  I introduce the Savage-Dickey density ratio, a computationally quick method
to determine the Bayes factor of two nested models and hence perform model
selection. As an illustration, I consider three key parameters for our
understanding of the cosmological concordance model. By using WMAP 3-year data
complemented by other cosmological measurements, I show that a non-scale
invariant spectral index of perturbations is favoured for any sensible choice
of prior. It is also found that a flat Universe is favoured with odds of 29:1
over non--flat models, and that there is strong evidence against a CDM
isocurvature component to the initial conditions which is totally
(anti)correlated with the adiabatic mode (odds of about 2000:1), but that this
is strongly dependent on the prior adopted.
  These results are contrasted with the analysis of WMAP 1-year data, which

compact (~100 AU) emission is detected, which has an elongated shape (axis
ratio ~3). For AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9, the emission is single-peaked,
while for the highest luminosity source, W33A, a `mini-cluster' of three
sources is detected. The derived sizes, flux densities, and broad-band radio
spectra of the sources support recent models where the initial expansion of HII
regions around very young O-type stars is prevented by stellar gravity. In
these models, accretion flows onto high-mass stars originate in large-scale
molecular envelopes and become ionized close to the star. These models
reproduce our observations of ionized gas as well as the structure of the
molecular envelopes of these sources on 10^3--10^4 AU scales derived previously
from single-dish submillimeter continuum and line mapping. For AFGL 2591, the
43 GHz flux density is also consistent with dust emission from a disk seen in
near-infrared `speckle' images. However, the alignment of the 43 GHz emission
with the large-scale molecular outflow argues against an origin in a disk for
AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9. In contrast, the outflow from W33A does not appear
to be collimated. Together with previously presented case studies of W3 IRS5
and AFGL 2136, our results indicate that the formation of stars and stellar
clusters with luminosities up to ~10^5 L0 proceeds through accretion and
produces collimated outflows as in the solar-type case, with the `additional
feature' that the accretion flow becomes ionized close to the star. Above ~10^5
L0, clusters of HII regions appear, and outflows are no longer collimated,
possibly as the result of mergers of protostars or pre-stellar cores.

question is addressed using both dynamical mean-field theory, and a
representation of fermion operators in terms of slave quantum spins, followed
by a mean-field approximation (similar in spirit to a Gutzwiller

orbital-selective for all values of the Coulomb exchange (Hund) coupling J when
the bandwidth ratio is small, and only beyond a critical value of J when the
bandwidth ratio is larger. Dynamical mean-field theory partially confirms these
findings, but the intermediate phase at J=0 is found to differ from a
conventional Mott insulator, with spectral weight extending down to arbitrary
low energy. Finally, the orbital-selective Mott phase is found, at
zero-temperature, to be unstable with respect to an inter-orbital

effectively the approximation corresponds to the dynamics where there are no

is found that the complete adiabatic approximants lead to a remarkable
improvement in the {\it effectualness} at lower PN ($<$ 3PN) orders, while
standard approximants of order $\geq$ 3PN provide a good lower-bound to the
complete approximants for the construction of effectual templates. {\it
Faithfulness} of complete approximants is better than that of standard

derived from the following conditions: (i) $s'\leq 2\pi T_{ab}k^ak^b$, where
$s'=k^a\grad_a s$ and $T_{ab}$ is the stress energy tensor; (ii) on the initial
2-surface $B$, $s(0)\leq -{1/4}\theta(0)$, where $\theta$ is the expansion of

a thermodynamic limit. The QED Hamiltonian is written in Coulomb gauge and does
not contain any normal-ordering or choice of bare electron/positron subspaces.
Neglecting photons, we define properly this Hamiltonian in a finite box
$[-L/2;L/2)^3$, with periodic boundary conditions and an ultraviolet cut-off
$\Lambda$. We then study the limit of the ground state (i.e. the vacuum) energy
and of the minimizers as $L$ goes to infinity, in the Hartree-Fock
approximation.
  In case with no external field, we prove that the energy per volume converges
and obtain in the limit a translation-invariant projector describing the free
Hartree-Fock vacuum. We also define the energy per unit volume of
translation-invariant states and prove that the free vacuum is the unique
minimizer of this energy.
  In the presence of an external field, we prove that the difference between
the minimum energy and the energy of the free vacuum converges as $L$ goes to
infinity. We obtain in the limit the so-called Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock
functional. The Hartree-Fock (polarized) vacuum is a Hilbert-Schmidt
perturbation of the free vacuum and it minimizes the Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock
energy.

recovered when they traverse the linac a second time, lambda/2 out of phase.
There is another interesting condition when the length of the transfer line is
(n+/- 1/4) lambda. In this case, the electrons drift through on the zero RF
crossing, and make a further pass around the transfer line, effectively
doubling the circulating current in the wigglers and undulators. On the third
pass through the linac, they will be decelerated and their energy recovered.
The longitudinal focusing at the zero crossing is a problem, but it can be
canceled if the drifting beam sees a positive energy gradient for the first
half of the linac and a negative gradient for the second half (or vice versa).
This paper presents a proposal to use a double chicane at the center of the
linac to provide this focusing inversion fo rthe drifting beam while leaving

complex separable term in such a way that the corresponding unitary and
non-unitary {\it KN} $S$ matrices are exactly reproduced. These {\it KN}

comprised of singular neutral modes with phase velocity in the range of the
velocity shear. We show how these stability boundaries can be evaluated without
solving for the growth rate over the entire parameter space as was previously
done. The results indicate further that there is a new instability domain that
has not been previously noted in the literature. The unstable modes, in this
new instability domain, appear for larger values of the Richardson number and
are related to the higher harmonics of the internal gravity wave spectrum.

classes of shapes; (c) how to simulate morphologically realistic systems of
multiple objects; (d) how to characterize the connectivity and topology of such
systems in terms of complex network concepts and measurements; and (e) how the

the individual morphological features of the basic objects. Although emphasis

for which the inner products are perfectly uniform. However, SIC-POVMs are
notoriously hard to construct and despite some success of constructing them
numerically, there is no analytic construction known. We present two
constructions of approximate versions of SIC-POVMs, where a small deviation
from uniformity of the inner products is allowed. The first construction is
based on selecting vectors from a maximal collection of mutually unbiased bases
and works whenever the dimension of the system is a prime power. The second
construction is based on perturbing the matrix elements of a subset of mutually
unbiased bases.
  Moreover, we construct vector systems in $\C^n$ which are almost orthogonal
and which might turn out to be useful for quantum computation. Our
constructions are based on results of analytic number theory.
