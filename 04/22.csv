making this the closest known galaxy-scale lensing system. The lensed object is
very blue (B-I = 1.1), and forms two prominent arcs and a less extended third
image. The Einstein radius is R_Ein=1.9 kpc (~3 arcsec on the sky, cf. 12
arcsec effective radius of the lens galaxy). Assuming a high redshift for the
source, the mass within R_Ein is 1.4x10^11 M_sun, and the I-band mass-to-light
ratio is 1.8 (M/L)_sun. The equivalent velocity dispersion is sigma_lens=310
km/s, in excellent agreement with the measured stellar dispersion sigma_v=320
km/s. Modeling the lensing potential with a singular isothermal ellipse (SIE),
we find close agreement with the light distribution. The best fit SIE model
reproduces the ellipticity of the lens galaxy to ~10%, and its position angle
within 1 degree. The model predicts the broad features of the arc geometry as
observed; the unlensed magnitude of the source is estimated at I ~ 23.75. We
suggest that one in ~200 similarly-massive galaxies within z<0.1 will exhibit
such a luminous multiply-imaged source.

their common nature as massive, young stars it has recently been suggested that
IRS 13E may be the remnant of a massive stellar cluster containing an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) that binds its members gravitationally in
the tidal field of Sgr A*. Here, we present an analysis of the proper motions
in the IRS~13E environment that combines the currently best available data with
a time line of 10 years. We find that an IMBH in IRS 13E must have a minimum
mass of ~10^4 solar masses in order to bind the source complex gravitationally.
This high mass limit in combination with the absence so far of compelling
evidence for a non-thermal radio and X-ray source in IRS 13E make it appear
unlikely that an IMBH exists in IRS 13E that is sufficiently massive to bind

highest intrinsic variability levels. The periodogram analysis yields a
small-amplitude modulation in the absorption troughs of the CIV5802/12 and
HeI5876 lines with a period of 0.83 days, which could be related either to
pulsations or large-scale rotating structures as seen in the WN4 star EZ Canis

weak but significant correlation between the varability in emission lines with
different ionization potential, i.e. in lines formed at different distances
from the WR stellar core. Adopting a beta wind-velocity law, from the motion of

of group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,
spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. All these
cross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the
`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups in
consideration. On scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlation
functions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. In
particular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massive
groups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. In the `1-halo' regime, the
cross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the group
center. We consider both a luminosity-weighted center (LWC) and a center
defined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (BGC). With the first
definition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to be
more centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. Using the
BGC, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, we
only find significant segregation in massive groups ($M \gta
10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours or
specific star formation rates). In haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,
there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. Comparing the
results from the 2dFGRS with those obtained from realistic mock samples, we
find that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated than
dark matter haloes predicted by the current $\Lambda$CDM model. (Abridged)

Several problems exist in this field, mostly related to the fact that
integrated properties are distributed. To date, this aspect has been either
ignored (as in standard synthesis models, which are inherently deterministic)
or interpreted phenomenologically (as in Monte Carlo simulations, which
describe distributed properties rather than explain them). We approach
population synthesis as a problem in probability theory, in which stellar
luminosities are random variables extracted from the stellar luminosity
distribution function (sLDF). We derive the population LDF (pLDF) for clusters
of any size from the sLDF, obtaining the scale relations that link the sLDF to
the pLDF. We recover the predictions of standard synthesis models, which are
shown to compute the mean of the sLDF. We provide diagnostic diagrams and a
simplified recipe for testing the statistical richness of observed clusters,
thereby assessing whether standard synthesis models can be safely used or a
statistical treatment is mandatory. We also recover the predictions of Monte
Carlo simulations, with the additional bonus of being able to interpret them in
mathematical and physical terms. We give examples of problems that can be
addressed through our probabilistic formalism. Though still under development,
ours is a powerful approach to population synthesis. In an era of resolved
observations and pipelined analyses of large surveys, this paper is offered as
a signpost in the field of stellar populations.

momentum conservation of an object that emits two equal electromagnetic wave
packets in opposite directions in its own frame. In contrast to Einstein's
derivation of this equation, which applies energy conservation to a similar
thought experiment, the new derivation employs no effects that are greater than
first order in v/c and therefore does not rely on results from Special
Relativity. In addition to momentum conservation, it uses only aberration of
starlight and the electromagnetic-wave momentum-energy relation p=E/c, both of
which were established by 1884. In particular, no assumption is made about the
constancy of the speed of light, and the derivation proceeds equally well if
one assumes that light is governed by a Galilean transformation. In view of
this, it is somewhat puzzling that the equivalence of mass and energy was not
derived well before the advent of Special Relativity. The new derivation is
simpler and more transparent than Einstein's and is therefore pedagogically

ESO's NTT and VLT. Using the NICE method we construct a dust extinction map of
the cloud, which reveals embedded globules, a dense filament, and a dense ring
structure. We derive dust column densities and masses for the entire cloud and
for the individual structures therein. We construct radial extinction profiles
for the embedded globules and find a range of profile shapes from relatively
shallow profiles for cores with low peak extinctions, to relatively steep
profiles for cores with high extinction. Overall the profiles are similar to
those of pressure truncated isothermal spheres of varying center-to-edge
density contrast. We apply Bonnor-Ebert analysis to compare the density
profiles of the embedded cores in a quantitative manner and derive physical
parameters such as temperatures, central densities, and external pressures. We
examine the stability of the cores and find that two cores are likely stable
and two are likely unstable. One of these latter cores is known to harbor an
active protostar. Finally, we discuss the relation between an emerging cluster
in Lupus 3 and the ring structure identified in our extinction map. Assuming
that the ring is the remnant of the core within which the cluster originally
formed we estimate that a star formation efficiency of ~ 30% characterized the
formation of the small cluster. Our observations of Lupus 3 suggest an intimate
link between the structure of a dense core and its state of star forming
activity. The dense cores are found to span the entire range of evolution from
a stable, starless core of modest central concentration, to an unstable,
star-forming core which is highly centrally concentrated, to a significantly
disrupted core from which a cluster of young stars is emerging.

emission relative to the stellar photosphere between 8 and 35 $\mu$m dominated
by strong features attributable to crystalline silicates with an emitting
surface area more than 1,000 times that of our zodiacal cloud. The spectrum
closely resembles that of the comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). Since no excess is
detected at 70 $\mu$m, the emitting material must be quite warm, be confined
within a few AU of the star, and originate in grains with low long-wavelength
emissivity, i.e. grains much smaller than $70 \mu$m$/2\pi\sim 10 $ $\mu$m. The
strong mineralogical features are evidence for even smaller, possibly
sub-micron sized grains. This small grain size is in direct contrast to the
10-100 $\mu$m grains that dominate the relatively featureless spectra of our
zodiacal dust cloud and most other main sequence stars with excesses. The upper
limit at 70 $\mu$m also implies that any Kuiper Belt analog must either be very
cold or be less massive than $\sim$ 5 times our own Kuiper Belt.
  With collisional and Poynting-Robertson drag times of about a thousand years
for small grains, the emitting material must either: a) be created through
continual grinding down of material in a dense asteroid belt; or b) originate
in cometary debris arising from either a single ``super-comet'' or a very large
number of individual comets arriving from a distant reservoir. In the case of a
cometary origin for the emission, the mass requirements for continuous
generation by many individual comets are unreasonable and we favor the capture
of a single ``super comet'' into a 0.5-1 AU orbit where it can evolve a large
number of small grains over a 2 Myr period.

similar to that of GRB 980425 and an upper limit on the rate density of

under-luminous events to occur at rates comparable to the BATSE GRB

clusters, which demonstrates that these objects are plausible progenitors of
old globular clusters (GCs). The method is based on the tight relationship for
old GCs between their V-band luminosities and (central) velocity dispersions,
sigma_0. We improve the significance of the relationship and find that its
functional form, L_V/Lsun \propto sigma_0^(1.57 +- 0.10) (km/s), is fully
consistent with previous determinations for smaller Galactic and M31 GC
samples. The tightness of the relationship for a GC sample drawn from
environments as diverse as those found in the Local Group implies that its
origin must be sought in intrinsic properties of the GC formation process
itself. We evolve the luminosities of the young massive star clusters (YMCs) in
the local Universe to an age of 12 Gyr and find that most YMCs will evolve to
loci close to, or to slightly fainter luminosities than the improved GC
relationship. In the absence of significant external disturbances, this implies
that these objects may potentially survive to become old GC-type objects over a
Hubble time. The main advantage of our new method is its simplicity; the only
observables required here are the system's velocity dispersion and luminosity.
The most important factor affecting the robustness of our conclusions is the
adopted form of the initial mass function. We use N-body simulations to confirm
that dynamical evolution of the clusters does not significantly alter our
conclusions. [ABRIDGED]

present in this thesis models for gamma-ray production in microquasars with the
aim to propose them as possible parent populations for different groups of

radio spectrum is GHz-peaked, consistent with it being relatively young. The
width of the CIV emission line, in conjunction with the total optical
luminosity, implies black-hole mass ~ 10^9 M(sun), L/L(Eddington) ~ 2. The high

free energy in the form of algebraic equation of different powers of
polarization components with the coefficients dependent on film thickness,
mismatch effect, temperature and other parameters. Several new terms
proportional to misfit strain appeared in the free energy expression: built-in
electric field normal to the surface originated from piezoelectricity in
vicinity of surface even for the cubic symmetry of bulk ferroelectrics, odd
powers of normal to the surface component of polarization. The obtained free
energy made it possible to calculate all properties of the film by conventional
procedure of minimization. As an example we calculated phase diagrams of PZT
50/50 films on different substrates that lead to compressive or tensile strain.
The calculations of pyroelectric coefficient and dielectric permittivity
temperature dependencies had shown the electret-like polar state, e.g.
existence of pyroelectricity, below the critical thickness of
ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions. Our theory predicts, that
mismatch-induced field could be compatible with thermodynamic coercive field
and thus cause self-polarization in thin ferroelectric films.

agree with experiment if the details of the electronic states around the Fermi
level are taken into account with some care. More precisely, we present a
calculation of the optical conductivity in YBa2Cu3O7 on the basis of an exact
(ab initio) three dimensional electronic band structure calculation from which
we extract the information on the bands near the Fermi energy that can be
associated to the CuO2 plane-carrier states. To simulate the superconducting
state we superimpose a gap to these bands alone. On these basis, we calculate
from the known Kubo-Greenwood formula, the optical conductivity in the normal
and in the superconducting state. Our calculation agrees with the experimental
result even in the higher part of the frequency spectrum. Our way of
calculating the resonance suggests a model of evolution for the bands under the
effect of doping consistent with the recent experimental findings that the
optical resonance can disappear while the sample remains superconducting. An
important conclusion of this paper is that the resonance depends mostly on the
details of the electronic band structure. It is enough to take into account the
effect of the superconducting transition through a single parameter (the gap).
No details on the mechanism are needed so no mechanism can be tested on this
basis. Our calculation suggests a model of evolution for the bands around the
Fermi energy under doping that gives some microscopic foundations to the the
recent experiments that show unambiguously that the resonance cannot be the
cause of superconductivity.

current-induced hadronic tau decays and (ii) e^+ e^- hadroproduction, in the
region below s~3-4 GeV^2, where discrepancies exist between the isospin-
breaking-corrected charged and neutral current I=1 spectral functions. The tau
data is found to be compatible with expectations based on high-scale
alpha_s(M_Z) determinations, while the electroproduction data displays two
problems. The results favor determinations of the leading order hadronic
contribution to (g-2)_mu which incorporate hadronic tau decay data over those
employing electroproduction data only, and hence a reduced discrepancy between
experiment and the Standard Model prediction for (g-2)_mu.

algorithm solving the constrained evolution equations for the initial-state QCD
radiation. The type of the parton (quark, gluon) and the energy fraction x of
the parton exiting emission chain (entering hard process) are predefined, i.e.
constrained throughout the evolution. Such a constraint is mandatory for any
realistic MC for the initial state QCD parton shower. We add one important
condition: the MC algorithm must not require the a priori knowledge of the full
numerical exact solutions of the evolution equations, as is the case in the
popular ``Markovian MC for backward evolution''. Our aim is to find at least
one solution of this problem that would function in practice. Finding such a
solution seems to be definitely within the reach of the currently available
computer CPUs and the sophistication of the modern MC techniques. We describe
in this work the first example of an efficient solution of this kind. Its
numerical implementation is still restricted to the pure gluon-strahlung. As
expected, it is not in the class of the so-called Markovian MCs. For this
reason we refer to it as belonging to a class of non-Markovian MCs. We show
that numerical results of our new MC algorithm agree very well (to 0.2%) with
the results of the other MC program of our own (unconstrained Markovian) and
another non-MC program QCDnum16. This provides a proof of the existence of the
new class of MC techniques, to be exploited in the precision perturbative QCD
calculations for the Large Hadron Collider.

find that these varieties are equidimensional; and we reduce the general

verify a conjecture of Reuman in many new cases, and to make progress toward a

  curvature","J. Differential Geom. 82, 1 (2009) 1-33",,"ESI 1651","math.DG math.CV",,"  The chains studied in this paper generalize Chern-Moser chains for CR
structures. They form a distinguished family of one dimensional submanifolds in
manifolds endowed with a parabolic contact structure. Both the parabolic
contact structure and the system of chains can be equivalently encoded as
Cartan geometries (of different types). The aim of this paper is to study the
relation between these two Cartan geometries for Lagrangean contact structures
and partially integrable almost CR structures.
  We develop a general method for extending Cartan geometries which generalizes
the Cartan geometry interpretation of Fefferman's construction of a conformal
structure associated to a CR structure. For the two structures in question, we
show that the Cartan geometry associated to the family of chains can be
obtained in that way if and only if the original parabolic contact structure is
torsion free. In particular, the procedure works exactly on the subclass of
(integrable) CR structures.
  This tight relation between the two Cartan geometries leads to an explicit
description of the Cartan curvature associated to the family of chains. On the
one hand, this shows that the homogeneous models for the two parabolic contact
structures give rise to examples of non-flat path geometries with large
automorphism groups. On the other hand, we show that one may (almost)
reconstruct the underlying torsion free parabolic contact structure from the
Cartan curvature associated to the chains. In particular, this leads to a very
conceptual proof of the fact that chain preserving contact diffeomorphisms are
either isomorphisms or anti-isomorphisms of parabolic contact structures.

supports a low-energy scattering resonance. However documented experimental
evidence of this effect has been lacking. Previous theoretical studies of this
phenomenon were confined to the regime where the range of the short-ranged
potential is much smaller than Bohr's radius of the Coulomb field. We go beyond
this limitation by restricting ourselves to highly-excited s states. This
allows us to demonstrate that along the Periodic Table of elements the
Zel'dovich effect manifests itself as systematic periodic variation of the
Rydberg spectra with a period proportional to the cubic root of the atomic
number. This dependence, which is supported by analysis of experimental and

is in terms of the Hurst exponent. A typical corresponding result is that its

the market and on the time scales involved. We study the high frequency price
changes on the American and on the German stock markets. For both corresponding
indices, the Dow Jones and the DAX respectively, the Hurst exponent analysis
results in values close to 0.5. However, by decomposing the market dynamics
into pairs of steps such that an elementary move up (down) is followed by
another move up (down) and explicitly counting the resulting conditional
probabilities we find values typically close to 60%. This effect of persistence
is particularly visible on the short time scales ranging from 1 up to 3
minutes, decreasing gradually to 50% and even significantly below this value on
the larger time scales. We also detect some asymmetry in persistence related to
the moves up and down, respectively. This indicates a subtle nature of the

longer rotationally invariant. These theoretical predictions, based on symmetry
considerations, are confirmed by means of a finite element numerical modelling.
Theoretical and computational results are then substantiated by experimental
investigations at millimeter wavelengths. As a result, a single-mode resonator
which enables all the relevant rotations of the sample is demonstrated at
millimeter wavelengths for the first time. In this resonator the intensity of
the microwave field on the sample and its orientation with respect to the

experimental realization of solid-state qubits. We analyze the dynamics of a
system of three qubits arranged in a linear geometry and a system of four
qubits arranged in a square geometry. Calculations are performed for several
quantum dot confining potentials. In the three-qubit case, three-body effects
are identified that have an important quantitative influence upon quantum
computation. In the four-qubit case, the full Hamiltonian is found to include
both three-body and four-body interactions that significantly influence the
dynamics in physically relevant parameter regimes. We consider the implications
of these results for the encoded universality paradigm applied to the
four-electron qubit code; in particular, we consider what is required to
circumvent the four-body effects in an encoded system (four spins per encoded
qubit) by the appropriate tuning of experimental parameters.

asymptotical separability criterion is suggested. Using the continuous ensemble
method, a sequence of separable density matrices is built which converges to
$\rho$ if and only if $\rho$ is separable. The convergence speed is evaluated
and for any given tolerance parameter $\kappa$ an iterative procedure is
suggested which decides in finite number of steps if there exists a separable
density matrix $\rho_\kappa$ which differs from the matrix $\rho$ by at most
$\kappa$.

  communication","3 pages RevTex, no figures. Revised version with corrected definition
  in abstract and few other (very) minor changes",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A black box with two input bits and two output bits is called a non-local PR
box, if the XOR of the output bits equals the AND of the input bits. In a
recent article, Cerf et al. show that Alice and Bob, using such a PR box, can
effectively simulate entanglement without the need of communication. We show
that an adaptation of a model due to Dirk Aerts, yields a realistic simulation
of the non-local PR box without communication. Because the model is entirely
realistic, it cannot violate relativistic constraints. Like a non-local box, it
can be used to simulate the singlet state coincidence probabilities, but the
time to complete the observation of the outcome will exceed the time it takes a
photon to travel one arm in an EPRB setup. The model explicitly shows how to
produce an outcome that is locally perfectly random, but nevertheless
determines what happens in the other wing of the experiment, without
communication taking place between the two wings. In this sense, it can serve
as an accurate metaphor for the mechanism of entanglement. The model
considerably strengthens the claim that no communication is necessary to
simulate entanglement.

constructed. This leads to an understanding of the appearance of classical
statistical correlations intertwined with the quantum correlations as well as a
physical underpinning of these correlations. As a byproduct of this analysis, a
physical basis of the classical statistical correlations leading to additive
entropy in a bipartite system discussed recently by Tsallis et al emerges as
inherent classical spin fluctuations. It is found that in this example, the
quantum correlations shrink the region of additivity in phase space.
