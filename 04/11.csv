detections allowed us to derive constraints on temperature, radius, and mass,
pointing to a companion that has expanded to a radius between one of a main
sequence star and one at the Roche-limit. We focus on the role of tidal
circularisation in the system, which will have transformed the initially
eccentric orbit expected from formation scenarios into the nearly circular
orbit presently observed. Based on simple energy balance arguments, we are able
to draw a picture of the companion's evolution resulting from the energy
deposition in the star due to circularisation. In this picture, our measurement
of the companion's parameters is consistent with the expected initial
eccentricity. However, with the present understanding of tidal dissipation it
remains difficult to account for the short time in which the system was
circularised.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20042268",,"astro-ph",,"  In this article we first outline the mounting evidence that a significant
fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by OB stars within HII regions escape
from their immediate surroundings and explain how an HII region structure
containing high density contrast in homogeneities facilitates this escape. Next
we describe sets of models containing inhomogeneities which are used to predict
tracks in the commonly used diagnostic diagrams (based on ratios of emission
lines) whose only independent variable is the photon escape fraction, xi. We
show that the tracks produced by the models in two of the most cited of these
diagrams conform well to the distribution of observed data points, with the
models containing optically thick inhomogeneities (""CLUMPY"" models) yielding
somewhat better agreement than those with optically thin inhomogeneities (""FF""
models). We show how variations in the ionization parameter U, derived from
emission line ratios, could be due to photon escape. Using a rather wide range
of assumptions about the filling factor of dense clumps we find, for a selected
set of regions observed in M51 photon escape fraction ranging between 30% and
50%. We show, using oxygen as the test element, that models with different
assumptions about the gas inhomogeneity will give variations in the abundance
values derived from diagnostic diagrams, but do not claim here to have a fully
developed set of diagnostic tools to improve abundance determinations made in
this way. We finally propose a combination of line ratios with the absolute
Halpha luminosity of a given HII region, which allows us to determine the
photon escape fraction, and hence resolve the degeneracy between U and xi.

molecules is the following: 1 to 4 for HCN and HNC, 9 to 39 for HC3N, 31 to 133
for HC5N, and 72 to 85 for HC7N (not detected beyond Jup=85). The lowest
vibrationally excited state of HC7N (nu_15 at 62 cm^-1) has been tentatively
detected. Data analysis has been performed by extending our previous
geometrical and radiative transfer model of the slowly expanding envelope (SEE)
surrounding the compact central continuum source of CRL 618, that was
established from the study of rotational lines in several vibrationally excited
states of HC_3N. The new lines analyzed here require to model the high velocity
wind (HVW) component and the colder circumstellar gas, remnant of the AGB phase
of CRL618. The derived HC3N/HC5N and HC5N/HC7N abundance ratios from this set
of uniformly calibrated lines are between 3 and 6 in the different regions,
similar to standard values in the CSM and ISM, and consistent with previous
estimates obtained from ISO observations and chemical models. However, the
abundance ratios of HC3N, HC5N and HC7N with respect to HCN are at least two
orders of magnitude larger than those typical for AGB C-rich stars, such as
IRC+10216. This fact indicates that, in the short transition toward the
Planetary Nebula phase, HCN is quickly reprocessed into longer cyanopolyyne
chains. A similar behavior was previously found in this object for the
polyacetylenic chains (C(2n)H2).

Nu Eri, analysis of the new data adds four independent frequencies to the nine
derived previously from the 2002-3 data, three in the range from 7.20 to 7.93
c/d, and a low one, equal to 0.614 c/d. Combining the new and the old data
results in two further independent frequencies, equal to 6.7322 and 6.2236 c/d.
Altogether, the oscillation spectrum is shown to consist of 12 high frequencies
and two low ones. The latter have u amplitudes about twice as large as the v
and y amplitudes, a signature of high radial-order g modes. Thus, the
suggestion that Nu Eri is both a Beta Cephei and an SPB star, put forward on
the basis of the first campaign's data, is confirmed.
  Nine of the 12 high frequencies form three triplets, of which two are new.
The triplets represent rotationally split l=1 modes, although in case of the
smallest-amplitude one this may be questioned. Mean separations and asymmetries
of the triplets are derived with accuracy sufficient for meaningful comparison
with models.
  The first comparison star, Mu Eri, is shown to be an SPB variable with an
oscillation spectrum consisting of six frequencies, three of which are
equidistant in period. The star is also found to be an eclipsing variable. The
eclipse is a transit, probably total, the secondary is fainter than the primary
by several magnitudes, and the system is widely detached.

variable. To the frequency of 10.8742 c/d seen already in the first campaign's

stars in massive close binary systems, they can be used to constrain the highly
uncertain mass and angular momentum budget during the major mass transfer
phase. We explore the progenitor evolution of the three best suited WR+O
binaries HD 90657, HD 186943 and HD 211853, which are characterized by a WR/O
mass ratio of $\sim$0.5 and periods of 6..10 days. We are doing so at three
different levels of approximation: predicting the massive binary evolution
through simple mass loss and angular momentum loss estimates, through full
binary evolution models with parametrized mass transfer efficiency, and through
binary evolution models including rotation of both components and a physical
model which allows to compute mass and angular momentum loss from the binary
system as function of time during the mass transfer process. All three methods
give consistently the same answers. Our results show that, if these systems
formed through stable mass transfer, their initial periods were smaller than
their current ones, which implies that mass transfer has started during the
core hydrogen burning phase of the initially more massive star. Furthermore,
the mass transfer in all three cases must have been highly non-conservative,
with on average only $\sim$10% of the transferred mass being retained by the
mass receiving star. This result gives support to our system mass and angular
momentum loss model, which predicts that, in the considered systems, about 90%
of the overflowing matter is expelled by the rapid rotation of the mass
receiver close to the $\Omega$-limit, which is reached through the accretion of
the remaining 10%.

very large data set (of order 10^9 stars) in the presence of observational
errors and against a background population of Galactic stars. We address this
issue through a numerical simulation of the Gaia catalogue with a realistic
number of entries. The Galaxy model includes separate light distributions and
kinematics for the bulge, disc and stellar halo. Our catalogue contains
3.5x10^8 stars. We perform tree code 10^6-body simulations of satellite dwarf
galaxies in orbit around a rigid mass model of the Galaxy. The shrinking
satellite cores and tidal tails are added to the Monte Carlo simulation of the
Gaia catalogue. When combining the Milky Way and dwarf galaxy models we include
the complication that the luminosity function of the satellite is probed at
various depths as a function of position along the tidal tails. The combined
models are converted to a synthetic Gaia catalogue using a detailed model for
the expected astrometric and radial velocity errors, depending on magnitude,
colour and sky position of the stars. We explore the feasibility of detecting
tidal streams in the halo using the energy versus angular momentum plane. A
straightforward search in this plane will be very challenging. The background
population and the observational errors make it difficult to detect tidal
streams as discrete structures in the E-Lz plane. The propagation of
observational errors leads to apparent caustic structures in the integrals of
motion space that may be mistaken for physical entities. Any practical search
strategy will have to use a combination of pre-selection of high-quality data
and complementary searches using the photometric data from Gaia. (abridged)

only very few experimental investigations of this initial slope and they
consist of Pb/Nn double layers (Nn stands for a normal metal). Surprisingly the
coefficient of the initial slope in these experiments is of the order or less
than 2 while the (weak coupling) theory predicts a value of about 4.5. This
discrepancy has not been recognized in the past. The autor suggests that it is

coupling between the moments of the LSMO layers at fields $<$ 200 Oe is seen in

on entering the superconducting state. The coupling energy J$_{1}$ at a fixed
temperature drops exponentially with the thickness of the YBCO layer. The
temperature and d$_{Y}$ dependencies of this primarily non-oscillatory J$_{1}$
are consistent with the coupling theories for systems in which transport is
controlled by tunneling. The truncation of the monotonic T dependence of
J$_{1}$ below T$_{c}$ suggests inhibition of single electron tunneling across
the CuO$_{2}$ planes as the in-plane gap parameter acquires a non-zero value.

exactly one cycle. An L-cycle cover is a cycle cover in which the length of
every cycle is in the set L. The weight of a cycle cover of an edge-weighted
graph is the sum of the weights of its edges.
  We come close to settling the complexity and approximability of computing
L-cycle covers. On the one hand, we show that for almost all L, computing
L-cycle covers of maximum weight in directed and undirected graphs is APX-hard
and NP-hard. Most of our hardness results hold even if the edge weights are
restricted to zero and one.
  On the other hand, we show that the problem of computing L-cycle covers of
maximum weight can be approximated within a factor of 2 for undirected graphs
and within a factor of 8/3 in the case of directed graphs. This holds for
arbitrary sets L.

embedding Minkowski spacetime, we show that the

A, accepted","Nucl.Phys.A762:147-166,2005","10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2005.08.007",,"nucl-th",,"  The production/absorption rate of particles in compressed and heated
asymmetric matter is studied using a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) transport
model with an isospin dependent collision term. Just from energy conservation
in the elementary production/absorption processes we expect to see a strong
dependence of the yields on the basic Lorentz structure of the isovector
effective interaction, due to isospin effects on the scalar and vector
self-energies of the hadrons. This will be particularly evident for the ratio
of the rates of particles produced with different charges: results are shown
for \pi(+)/\pi(-), K(+)/K(0) yields. In order to simplify the analysis we
perform RMF cascade simulations in a box with periodic boundary conditions. In
this way we can better pin down all such fine relativistic effects in particle
production, that could likely show up even in realistic heavy ion collisions.
In particular, K(+,0) production is expected to be directly related to the high
density behaviour of the symmetry energy, since kaons are produced very early
during the high density stage of the collision and their mean free path is
rather large. We show that the K(+)/K(0) ratio reflects important isospin
contributions on the production rates just because of the large sensitivity
around the threshold. The results are very promising for the possibility of a
direct link between particle production data in exotic Heavy Ion Collisions and
the isospin dependent part of the Equation of State at high baryon densities.

of the impossibility of proving experimentally that matter actually disappears.
Recent work has provided evidence that photons are not destroyed in radiative
absorption, for example, but rather attain an undetectable (E=h(nu)=0) state.
Questioning the creation-annihilation hypothesis in the case of positronium
decay leads to the construction of an exponentially damped Breit-Pauli
Hamiltonian which when employed in a Schroedinger equation gives an e+e- ground
state with a binding energy of 1.022 MeV. The analogous treatment does not
produce any (unobserved) states of similarly low energy for the hydrogen atom,
but by virtue of a simple scaling theorem it does lead to a maximal
proton-antiproton binding energy of 1.876 GeV, which is exactly mp/me times
larger than for e+e-. Arguments are presented to identify the resulting tightly
bound e+ e- system with the photon itself, since both are ascribed a zero rest
mass. The above Hamiltonian is identified with the unified electroweak
interaction, especially since it also proves applicable to the description of
neutrino processes. It is pointed out that the analogous (nu)(bar nu) binary
systems would be subject to predissociation into free neutrinos and
antineutrinos, however, unlike their much more strongly bound e+ e- and p+ p-
counterparts. This observation suggests a different explanation for the
well-known solar neutrino problem than the flavor-oscillation theory which has
been proposed earlier.

generating and analyzing more data. The next step is then to seek some evidence

superluminal motion of a bug shadow. Griffiths considers that this example is
conceptually very close to quantum nonlocality or superluminality,i.e. quantum
breaking of the famous Bell inequality. Or, generally, he suggests implicitly
an absolute asymmetric duality (subluminality vs. superluminality) principle in
any fundamental physical theory.It, he hopes, can be used for a natural
interpretation of the quantum mechanics too. But we explain that such
Griffiths's interpretation retires implicitly but significantly from usual,
Copenhagen interpretation of the standard quantum mechanical formalism. Within
Copenhagen interpretation basic complementarity principle represents, in fact,
a dynamical symmetry principle (including its spontaneous breaking, i.e.
effective hiding by measurement). Similarly, in other fundamental physical
theories instead of Griffiths's absolute asymmetric duality principle there is
a dynamical symmetry (including its spontaneous breaking, i.e. effective hiding
in some of these theories) principle. Finally, we show that Griffiths's example
of the bug shadow superluminal motion is definitely incorrect (it sharply
contradicts the remarkable Roemer's determination of the speed of light by
coming late of Jupiter's first moon shadow).

  1) Interactive proofs with quantum advice: We show that the class $QIP/qpoly$
contains ALL languages. That is, for any language $L$ (even non-recursive), the

quantum interactive proof, where the verifier is a polynomial-size quantum
circuit with working space initiated with some quantum state $|\Psi_{L,n} >$
(depending only on $L$ and $n$). Moreover, the interactive proof that we give
is of only one round, and the messages communicated are classical.
  2) PCP with only one query: We show that the membership $x \in SAT$ (for $x$

together with a polynomial-size classical proof consisting of blocks of length
$polylog(n)$ bits each, such that after measuring the state $|\Psi >$ the
