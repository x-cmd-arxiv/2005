recycled in galaxies and are deposited into the intergalactic medium. New
observations are revealing the ubiquity of this process, particularly at high
redshift. We describe the physics behind these winds, discuss the observational
evidence for them in nearby star-forming and active galaxies and in the
high-redshift universe, and consider the implications of energetic winds for
the formation and evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. To
inspire future research, we conclude with a set of observational and
theoretical challenges.

fluctuations on the thermal pressure distribution in thermally bistable flows.
The simulations employ a random turbulent driving generated in Fourier space
rather than star-like heating. The turbulent fluctuations are characterized by
their rms Mach number M and the energy injection wavenumber, k_for. Our results
are consistent with the picture that as either of these parameters is
increased, the local ratio of turbulent crossing time to cooling time
decreases, causing transient structures in which the effective behavior is
intermediate between the thermal-equilibrium and adiabatic regimes. As a
result, the effective polytropic exponent gamma_ef ranges between ~0.2 to ~1.1.
The fraction of high-density zones with P>10^4 Kcm^-3 increases from roughly
0.1% at k_for=2 and M=0.5 to roughly 70% for k_for=16 and M=1.25. A preliminary
comparison with the pressure measurements of Jenkins (2004) favors our case
with M=0.5 and k_for=2. In all cases, the dynamic range of the pressure summed
over the entire density range, typically spans 3-4 orders of magnitude. The
total pressure histogram widens as the Mach number is increased, and develops
near-power-law tails at high (resp.low) pressures when gamma_ef<~ 0.5 (resp.
gamma_ef>~ 1), which occurs at k_for=2 (resp.k_for=16) in our simulations. The
opposite side of the pressure histogram decays rapidly, in an approx. lognormal
form. Our results show that turbulent advection alone can generate large
pressure scatters, with power-law high-P tails for large-scale driving, and
provide validation for approaches attempting to derive the shape of the
pressure histogram through a change of variable from the known form of the
density histogram, such as that performed by MacLow et al.(2004).

occur. A constant ammonia fractionation ratio in star-forming regions is
generally assumed to be consistent with an origin on dust grains. However, in
the pre-stellar cores studied here, the fractionation varies significantly when
going from NH3 to ND3. We present a steady state model of the gas-phase
chemistry for these sources, which includes passive depletion onto dust grains
and multiply saturated deuterated species up to five deuterium atoms (e.g.
CD5+). The observed column density ratios of all four ammonia isotopologues are
reproduced within a factor of 3 for a gas temperature of 10 K. We also predict
that deuterium fractionation remains significant at temperatures up to 20 K. ND

predicted to be abundant.

has revealed mid-infrared excesses for 33 field stars with known spectral types
in a 1.2 sq. degree field centered on the southern Galactic HII region RCW49.
These stars comprise a subset of 184 stars with known spectral classification,
most of which were pre-selected to have unusually red IR colors. We propose
that the mid-IR excesses are caused by circumstellar dust disks that are either
very late remnants of stellar formation or debris disks generated by planet
formation. Of these 33 stars, 29 appear to be main-sequence stars based on
optical spectral classifications. Five of the 29 main-sequence stars are O or B
stars with excesses that can be plausibly explained by thermal bremsstrahlung
emission, and four are post main-sequence stars. The lone O star is an O4V((f))
at a spectrophotometric distance of 3233+ 540- 535 pc and may be the earliest
member of the Westerlund 2 cluster. Of the remaining 24 main-sequence stars, 18
have SEDs that are consistent with hot dusty debris disks, a possible signature
of planet formation. Modeling the excesses as blackbodies demonstrates that the
blackbody components have fractional bolometric disk-to-star luminosity ratios,
LIR/L*, ranging from 10^-3 to 10^-2 with temperatures ranging from 220 to 820
K. The inferred temperatures are more consistent with asteroid belts rather
than the cooler temperatures expected for Kuiper belts. Mid-IR excesses are
found in all spectral types from late B to early K.

theoretical efforts. Here we show that all the types of spectral evolution and
spectral shapes that have been observed can indeed be described with one and
the same model, namely a hybrid model of a thermal and a non-thermal component.
We further show that the thermal component is the key emission process
determining the spectral evolution. Even though bursts appear to have a variety
of, sometimes complex, spectral evolutions, the behaviors of the two separate
components are remarkably similar for all bursts, with the temperature
describing a broken power-law in time. The non-thermal component is consistent
with emission from a population of fast cooling electrons emitting
optically-thin synchrotron emission or non-thermal Compton radiation. This
indicates that these behaviors are the fundamental and characteristic ones for
gamma-ray bursts.

newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a
general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, which consists of three
sets of differential equations, one in each side of the sonic line and the
other along it. By solving the equations along the sonic line we find
explicitly the spectrum, $k$, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the
stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are
smoothly across the sonic line, our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran.
To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions
outside the sonic line, we study the linear perturbations in the external
region of the sonic line (the ones in the internal region are identically
zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary
conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial
infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the
boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on $k$.
As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime
does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only
along the sonic line.

(SDSS) II, a proposed 3-year extension to the SDSS, we have conducted an early
engineering and science run during the fall of 2004, which consisted of
approximately 20 scheduled nights of repeated imaging of half of the southern
equatorial stripe. Transient supernova-like events were detected in near
real-time and photometric measurements were made in the five SDSS filter
bandpasses with a cadence of ~2 days. Candidate type Ia supernovae (SNe) were
pre-selected based on their colors, light curve shape, and the properties of
the host galaxy. Follow-up spectroscopic observations were performed with the
Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5m telescope and the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly
Telescope to confirm their types and measure the redshifts. The 2004 campaign
resulted in 22 spectroscopically confirmed SNe, which includes 16 type Ia, 5
type II, and 1 type Ib/c. These SN Ia will help fill in the sparsely sampled
redshift interval of z = 0.05 - 0.35, the so-called 'redshift desert', in the
Hubble diagram. Detailed investigation of the spectral properties of these
moderate-redshift SNe Ia will also provide a bridge between local SNe and
high-redshift objects, and will help us understand the systematics for future
cosmological applications that require high photometric precision. Finally, the
large survey volume also provides the opportunity to select unusual supernovae
for spectroscopic study that are poorly sampled in other surveys. We report on
some of the early results from this program and discuss potential future
applications.

these dense environments. Such interactions may be (at least partly)
responsible for the transformation of normal star-forming galaxies into passive
dwarf ellipticals (dEs). In this contribution we present the first systematic
study of the IntraCluster Light (ICL) for a statistically representative sample
(Zibetti et al. 2005), which comprises 683 clusters selected between z=0.2 and
0.3 from ~1500 deg^2 in the SDSS. Their ICL is studied by stacking the images
in the g-, r-, and i-band after masking out all galaxies and polluting sources.
In this way a very uniform background illumination is obtained, that allows us
to measure surface brightnesses as faint as 31 mag/arcsec^2 and to trace the
ICL out to 700 kpc from the central galaxy. We find that the local fraction of
light contributed by intracluster stars rapidly decreases as a function of the
clustercentric distance, from ~40% at 100 kpc to ~5% at 500 kpc. By comparing
the distribution and colours of the ICL and of the clusters galaxies, we find
indication that the main source of ICL are the stars stripped from galaxies
that plunge deeply into the cluster potential well along radial orbits. Thus,
if dEs are the remnants of these stripped progenitors we should expect similar
radial orbital anisotropies and correlations between the dE luminosity function
and the amount of ICL in different clusters. The diffuse emission we measure is
contaminated by faint unresolved galaxies: this makes our flux estimate depend
to some extent on the assumed luminosity function, but, on the other hand,
allows us to constrain the number of faint galaxies. Our present results
disfavour steep (alpha<-1.35) faint-end powerlaw slopes.

applications to cosmology suggest of possibility of avoiding the singularity
and replace it with the bounce. The distant type Ia supernovae data are used to
constraints on bouncing evolutional scenario where square of the Hubble
function $H^2$ is given by formulae
$H^2=H^2_0[\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{m}-\Omega_{n,0}(1+z)^{n}]$, where $\Omega_{m,0},
\Omega_{n,0}>0$ are density parameters and $n>m>0$. We show that the on the
base of the SNIa data standard bouncing models can be ruled out on the
$4\sigma$ confidence level. If we add the cosmological constant to the standard
bouncing model then we obtain as the best-fit that the parameter $\Omega_{n,0}$
is equal zero which means that the SNIa data do not support the bouncing term
in the model. The bounce term is statistically insignificant the present epoch.
We also demonstrate that BBN offer the possibility of obtaining stringent
constraints of the extra term $\Omega_{n,0}$. The other observational test
methods like CMB and the age of oldest objects in the Universe are used. We
also use the Akaike informative criterion to select a model according to the
goodness of fit and we conclude that this term should be ruled out by Occam's

well described by a two-component model comprising a power law with constant
spectral shape and variable normalisation and a much more constant ionised
reflection component from the inner accretion. One of the observations was
performed when the source was in a particularly low flux state in which the
X-ray spectrum is rather peculiar and exhibits a very flat hard spectrum with
broad residuals below 6.6 keV and a steep soft excess below about 1 keV. We
interpret the spectrum as being reflection-dominated by X-ray reprocessed
emission from the inner accretion disc. The primary continuum is almost
completely unobserved possibly because of strong light bending towards the
central black hole. The ionised reflection model simultaneously accounts for
the broad residuals and hard flat spectrum and for the soft excess. The same
model provides an excellent description of the data at all the other flux
levels, the most important difference being a variation in the power law
normalisation. Our results imply that most of the X-ray emission in this source
originates from within few gravitational radii from the central black hole and
requires that the compact object is an almost maximally spinning Kerr black
hole. (abridged)

We employ density-functional theory calculations to address the thermodynamic
stability and magnetism of both pseudomorphic CsCl-like $M$Si ($M$=Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni) thin films and Heusler alloy $M_2$MnSi ($M$=Fe, Co, Ni) films on Si(001).
Our calculations show that Si-termination of the $M$Si films is energetically
preferable during epitaxy since it minimizes the energetic cost of broken bonds
at the surface. Moreover, we can explain the calculated trends in thermodynamic
stability of the $M$Si thin films in terms of the $M$-Si bond-strength and the
$M$ 3d orbital occupation. From our calculations, we predict that ultrathin
MnSi films are FM with sizable spin magnetic moments at the Mn atoms, while
FeSi and NiSi films are nonmagnetic. However, CoSi films display itinerant
ferromagnetism. For the $M_2$MnSi films with Heusler-type structure, the MnSi
termination is found to have the highest thermodynamic stability. In the FM
ground state, the calculated strength of the effective coupling between the
magnetic moments of Mn atoms within the same layer approximately scales with
the measured Curie temperatures of the bulk $M_2$MnSi compounds. In particular,
the Co$_2$MnSi/Si(001) thin film has a robust FM ground state as in the bulk,

splitting due to metal-metal overlap along the c-axis of the corundum

asymmetric with considerably more weight on the high energy branch. We argue
that this asymmetry is due to an unexpected broadening of the bonding a_{1g}

the antibonding a_{1g} states display no such hybridization and form a sharp
peak. Our results shed new light on the role of the a_{1g} orbitals for the

Cd as a function of temperature and excitation level. The optical response in
time domain is well fitted by linear combination of a damped harmonic
oscillation because of excitation of coherent $E_{2g}$ phonon and a
subpicosecond transient response due to electron-phonon thermalization. The
electron-phonon thermalization time monotonically increases with temperature,
consistent with the thermomodulation scenario, where at high temperatures the
system can be well explained by the two-temperature model, while below
$\approx$ 50 K the nonthermal electron model needs to be applied. As the
lattice temperature increases, the damping of the coherent $E_{2g}$ phonon
increases, while the amplitudes of both fast electronic response and the
coherent $E_{2g}$ phonon decrease. The temperature dependence of the damping of
the $E_{2g}$ phonon indicates that population decay of the coherent optical
phonon due to anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling dominates the decay process. We
present a model that accounts for the observed temperature dependence of the
amplitude assuming the photoinduced absorption mechanism, where the signal
amplitude is proportional to the photoinduced change in the quasiparticle
density. The result that the amplitude of the $E_{2g}$ phonon follows the
temperature dependence of the amplitude of the fast electronic transient
indicates that under the resonant condition both electronic and phononic
responses are proportional to the change in the dielectric function.

Condensation of the bosonic spinons leads to the $AF$, where the condensed

elementary excitations in the $AF$. {\it Approaching the $QCP$ from the $AF$,
spin 1 critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations are expected to break up into
spin 1/2 critical bosonic spinons. Then, these bosonic spinons hybridize with

fermionic spinons decay into the bosonic spinons and the spinless fermions.
But, the spinless fermions are confined and thus, only the bosonic spinons
emerge at the $QCP$. This coincides with the recent studies of {\it deconfined

media with weak periodic modulation of the permittivity, and photonic crystals

It is shown that in these systems, in contrast to electrons in solid crystals,

polaritons arises in the photonic crystals due to the interaction of the
electromagnetic field, eigenoscillations of the dielectric medium, and Debye
resonance. The widths of the transparency zones and of the band gaps have been

is shown that in the photonic crystals with dispersion, the number of

The transition is of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type and occurs between

does not obey any scaling. A scaling relation is valid not for minimal, but for
some effective Lyapunov exponent, whose dependence on parameters is determined
by scaling itself. If finite-size scaling is based on the effective Lyapunov

probable. Interpretation of the results in terms of the Gell-Mann -- Low

oxygens to Zn are larger than in the unsubstituted clusters. The calculated
electric field gradient at Cu sites that are nearest neighbor to Zn is found to

general relativity to generic off-diagonal metrics defining knew classes of
exact solutions in 4D and 5D gravity. These solutions possess Lie algebroid
symmetries and local anisotropy and define certain generalizations of manifolds
with Killing and/ or Lie algebra symmetries. For Lie algebroids, there are
structures functions depending on variables on a base submanifold and it is
possible to work with singular structures defined by the 'anchor' map. This
results in a number of new physical implications comparing with the usual
manifolds possessing Lie algebra symmetries defined by structure constants. The
spacetimes investigated here have two physically distinct properties: First,
they can give rise to disk type configurations with angular/ time/ extra
dimension gravitational polarizations and running constants. Second, they
define static, stationary or moving disks in nontrivial solitonic backgrounds,
with possible warped factors, additional spinor and/or noncommutative
symmetries. Such metrics may have nontrivial limits to 4D gravity with
vanishing, or nonzero torsion. The work develops the results of Ref.
gr-qc/0005025 and emphasizes the solutions with Lie algebroid symmetries

of a more complex nature than the Dirac $\d$-function. To study them, a
technique has been used based on a limiting solution sequence. The solutions
are shown to satisfy the Einstein equations everywhere, if the energy-momentum

strongly enhanced comparing with amorphous medium. In appendixes the integral

oscillators that goes beyond the existing results for all-to-all networks of
identical oscillators. Our work is applicable to oscillator networks of
arbitrary interconnection topology with uncertain natural frequencies. Using
tools from spectral graph theory and control theory, we prove that for
couplings above a critical value, the synchronized state is locally
asymptotically stable, resulting in convergence of all phase differences to a
constant value, both in the case of identical natural frequencies as well as
uncertain ones. We further explain the behavior of the system as the number of
oscillators grows to infinity.

algebraic tools which might lead to new generalizations of the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and the Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch theorem.
Despite this pivotal role in the traditional investigations and the efforts of
various people the most general version of Tsygan's formality conjecture has
not yet been proven. In my thesis I propose Fedosov resolutions for the
Hochschild cohomological and homological complexes of the algebra of functions
on an arbitrary smooth manifold. Using these resolutions together with
Kontsevich's formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild cochains of R[[y_1,
>..., y_d]] and Shoikhet's formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild chains of
R[[y_1,..., y_d]] I prove Tsygan's formality conjecture for Hochschild chains
of the algebra of functions on an arbitrary smooth manifold. The construction
of the formality quasi-isomorphism for Hochschild chains is manifestly
functorial for isomorphisms of the pairs (M,\nabla), where M is the manifold
and \nabla is an affine connection on the tangent bundle. In my thesis I apply
these results to equivariant quantization, computation of Hochschild homology
of quantum algebras and description of traces in deformation quantization.

  Engineering",,,,"physics.ao-ph",,"  The topographical scattering of gravity waves is investigated using a
spectral energy balance equation that accounts for first order wave-bottom
Bragg scattering. This model represents the bottom topography and surface waves
with spectra, and evaluates a Bragg scattering source term that is
theoretically valid for small bottom and surface slopes and slowly varying
spectral properties. The robustness of the model is tested for a variety of
topographies uniform along one horizontal dimension including nearly
sinusoidal, linear ramp and step profiles. Results are compared with
reflections computed using an accurate method that applies integral matching
along vertical boundaries of a series of steps. For small bottom amplitudes,
the source term representation yields accurate reflection estimates even for a
localized scatterer. This result is proved for small bottom amplitudes $h$
relative to the mean water depth $H$. Wave reflection by small amplitude bottom
topography thus depends primarily on the bottom elevation variance at the Bragg
resonance scales, and is insensitive to the detailed shape of the bottom
profile. Relative errors in the energy reflection coefficient are found to be
typically $2h/H$.

These peaks can not be explained by one scale theories. The theory was assessed
by calculating the light scattering profiles using the Atomic Force Microscope

comparing the results with experiments. The theory is in good agreement with

of genetic and metabolic networks of organisms, as well as in identifying
single genes and reactions that are essential for the organism. A goal of
computational and systems biology is to go beyond identification towards an
explanation of specific modules and essential genes and reactions in terms of
specific structural or evolutionary constraints. In the metabolic networks of
E. coli, S. cerevisiae and S. aureus, we identified metabolites with a low
degree of connectivity, particularly those that are produced and/or consumed in
just a single reaction. Using FBA we also determined reactions essential for
growth in these metabolic networks. We find that most reactions identified as
essential in these networks turn out to be those involving the production or
consumption of low degree metabolites. Applying graph theoretic methods to
these metabolic networks, we identified connected clusters of these low degree
metabolites. The genes involved in several operons in E. coli are correctly
predicted as those of enzymes catalyzing the reactions of these clusters. We
independently identified clusters of reactions whose fluxes are perfectly
correlated. We find that the composition of the latter `functional clusters' is
also largely explained in terms of clusters of low degree metabolites in each
of these organisms. Our findings mean that most metabolic reactions that are
essential can be tagged by one or more low degree metabolites. Those reactions
are essential because they are the only ways of producing or consuming their
respective tagged metabolites. Furthermore, reactions whose fluxes are strongly
correlated can be thought of as `glued together' by these low degree
metabolites.

support for the hypothesis that the phenomena largely result from local
short-range (< 0.5 mm) cortical connections and LGN input. Surround suppression
in our simulations results from (A) direct cortical inhibition or (B)
suppression of recurrent cortical excitation, or (C) action of both these
mechanisms simultaneously. Mechanisms B and C are substantially more prevalent
than A. We observe an average growth in the range of spatial summation of
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs for low contrast. However, we find
this is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain contrast dependent
receptive field size, which usually involves additional changes in the relative

different potential energy functions. Among them, the Pearson's correlation
coefficient r has no units and allows only semi-quantitative statements to be

physically relevant scale, such as the root mean square deviation (RMSD), the
mean error of the energies (ER), the standard deviation of the error (SDER) or
the mean absolute error (AER), overestimate the distance between potentials.
Moreover, their precise statistical meaning is far from clear. In this article,
a new measure of the distance between potential energy functions is defined
which overcomes the aforementioned difficulties. In addition, its precise
physical meaning is discussed, the important issue of its additivity is
investigated and some possible applications are proposed. Finally, two of these
applications are illustrated with practical examples: the study of the van der
