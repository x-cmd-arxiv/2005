interactionson the star formation activity in the local Universe. We selected
galaxy pairs from the 3D galaxy distribution according to a proximity
criterion. The 2D galaxy catalog was constructed by projecting the 3D total
galaxy distribution and then selecting projected galaxy pairs. The analysis of
the 3D galaxy pair catalog showed that an enhancement of the star formation
activity can be statistically correlated with proximity.
  The projected galaxy pairs exhibited a similar trend with projected distances
and relative radial velocities. However, the star formation enhancement signal
is diminished with respect to that of the 3D galaxy pair catalog owing to
projection effects and spurious galaxy pairs. Overall, we found that
hierarchical scenarios reproduced the observational dependence of star
formation activity in pairs on orbital parameters and environment. We also
found that geometrical effects due to projection modify the trends more
severely than those introduced by spurious pairs.

means of measuring the effect, its variation, its potential anisotropies, and
its region of influence. We show that minor planets provide an observational
vehicle for investigating the gravitational field in the outer solar system,
and that a sustained observation campaign against properly chosen minor planets
could confirm or refute the existence of the Pioneer Effect. Additionally, even

produce short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Two possibilities are discussed: the
annihilation of neutrino anti-neutrino pairs above the merged remnant and the
exponential amplification of magnetic fields in the central object up to values
close to equipartition. We find that the neutrino annihilation drives bipolar,
relativistic outflows with Lorentz-factors large enough to circumvent the GRB
'compactness problem'. The total energy within these outflows is moderate by
GRB-standards ($\sim 10^{48}-10^{49}$ ergs), but the interaction with the
baryonic material blown-off by the neutrinos collimates the outflows into
opening angles of typically 0.1 sterad, yielding isotropic energies close to
$10^{51}$ ergs. We further want to stress the plausibility of the central
object resisting the immediate collapse to a black hole. In this case the
central object will --similar to a proto-neutron star-- be subject to neutrino
driven convection that --together with the rapid, differential rotation-- will
lead to a drastic amplification of pre-existing magnetic fields. Within
fractions of a second, field strengths comparable to equipartition field
strength ($> 10^{17}$ G) will be reached. These will produce large torques that
will spin-down the object within about 0.2 s, and would thus naturally explain
the duration of short GRBs.

particularly intriguing plerionic SNR in which the central powering engine is
not yet detected. Early Chandra observations revealed a faint extended X-ray
halo which was suggested to be associated with the SNR shell; however its
spectrum was nonthermal, unlike what is expected from an SNR shell. On the
other hand, a plerionic origin to the halo is problematic since the X-ray
plerion would be larger than the radio plerion. We present here our analysis of
an integrated 245 ksec of archival Chandra data acquired with the
High-Resolution Camera (HRC) and 520 ksec acquired with the Advanced CCD

a rich structure in the inner (40""-radius) bright plerion including wisps and a
double-lobed morphology with an axis of symmetry running in the
northwest-southeast direction. Our spatially resolved spectroscopic study of
the ACIS-I data indicates that the photon index steepens with increasing
distance from the central point source out to a radius of 40"" then becomes
constant at ~2.4 in the X-ray halo (for a column density N_H=2.2E22/cm^2). No
line emission was found from the eastern limb; however marginal evidence for
line emission in the halo's northern knots was found. This study illustrates
the need for deep Chandra observations to reveal the missing SNR material in

be \phi(-21.6) = (2.6+/-0.7) x 10^{-5} mag^{-1} Mpc^{-3}. This must be the most
reliable measurement ever obtained of the number density of bright z~6 LBGs,
because it is more robust against both contamination and cosmic variance than
previous values. The FUV luminosity density contributed from LBGs brighter than
MFUV = -21.3 is (2.8+/-0.8) x 10^{24} ergs/s/Hz/Mpc^3, which is equivalent to a
star formation rate density of (3.5+/-1.0) x 10^{-4} Msun/yr/Mpc^3. Combining
our measurement with those at z<6 in the literature, we find that the FUV
luminosity density of bright galaxies increases by an order of magnitude from
z~6 to z~3 and then drops by 10^3 from z~3 to the present epoch, while the
evolution of the total luminosity density is much milder. The evolutionary
behavior of bright LBGs resembles that of luminous dusty star-forming galaxies

(SNIa) on the evolution of stellar systems. An effective formalism is presented
to couple the SNIa rate to the star formation history, which rests upon the
definition of two key properties of the progenitor's model: the realization
probability of the SNIa event from a single stellar generation and the
distribution function of the delay times. It is shown that the current SNIa
rate in late type galaxies implies that the realization probability is on the
order of 0.001. Analytical formulations for the distribution function of the
delay times for Single (SD) and Double Degenerate (DD) progenitors are derived,
based on stellar evolution arguments. These formulations, which agree well with
the results of Monte Carlo simulations for the evolution of close binaries,
have a built in parametrization of the key properties of the alternative
candidates. The various models for the progenitors have different impact on the
large scales. In particular, the paper examines the systematic trend of the
SNIa rate per unit mass with the color of the parent galaxy, and shows that the
recent observations favor the DD model. The SD scenario can reproduce the data
only if the distribution of the primordial mass ratios is flat, and the
accretion efficiency onto the WD is close to 100%. The timescale for the Fe
release from SNIa to the interstellar medium ranges between 0.3 and 3 Gyr for a
wide variety of hypothesis on the SNIa progenitors. (ABRIDGED)

for a quantitative determination of the increase of the growth rate due to the

state, non-thermal source where rapidly accelerated electrons cool by emitting
synchrotron radiation and Compton upscattering ambient photons produced outside
the source. We focus on the case where the radiation density inside the source
exceeds that of the magnetic field. We show that the KN reduction in the
electron Compton cooling rate causes the steady-state electron spectrum to
harden at energies above \gamma_{KN}, where \gamma_{KN}= 1/4\epsilon_0 and
\epsilon_0=h\nu_0/m_ec^2 is the characteristic ambient photon energy. The
source synchrotron spectrum thus shows a high-energy ``bump'' or excess even
though the electron acceleration spectrum has no such excess. In contrast, the
low-energy Compton gamma-ray spectrum shows little distortion because the
electron hardening compensates for the KN decline in the scattering rate. For
sufficiently high electron energies, however, Compton cooling becomes so
inefficient that synchrotron cooling dominates -- an effect omitted in most
previous studies. The hardening of the electron distribution thus stops,
leading to a rapid decline in Compton gamma-ray emission, i.e., a strong
spectral break whose location does not depend on the maximum electron energy.
This break can limit the importance of Compton gamma-ray pair production on
ambient photons and implies that a source's synchrotron luminosity may exceed
its Compton luminosity even though the source magnetic field energy density is
smaller than the ambient radiation energy density. We discuss the importance of
these KN effects in blazars, micro-quasars, and pulsar binaries.

principle be generalized to quark stars entering a superconductive phase where
similar photon generation mechanisms are at play. As much as 10^{45}-10^{47}
erg of energy is provided by the GLB decay in the 2SC phase. The generated
photons slowly diffuse out of the quark star keeping it hot and radiating as a
black-body (with possibly a Wien spectrum in gamma-rays) for millions of years.

theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. In the
simulations at moderate Bjerrum length, we observe that the brush height varies
weakly with grafting density, in contrast to the accepted scaling law, which
predicts a brush thickness independent of the grafting density. We show that
such behavior can be explained by considering lateral electrostatic effects
(within the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory) combined with the coupling
between lateral and longitudinal degrees of freedom due to the conserved
polymer volume (which are neglected in scaling arguments). We also take the
non-linear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains into consideration, which makes
significant effects as chains are almost fully stretched in the osmotic regime.
It is shown that all these factors lead to a non-monotonic behavior for the
brush height as a function of the grafting density. At large grafting
densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due
to the volume constraint. At small grafting densities, we obtain a
re-stretching of the chains for decreasing grafting density, which is caused by
lateral electrostatic contributions and the counterion-condensation process at
polyelectrolyte chains. These results are obtained assuming all counterions to
be trapped within the brush, which is valid for sufficiently long chains of
large charge fraction.

introduced strong-coupling theory, which becomes asymptotically exact in the
limit of large coupling parameter (i.e. for large counterion valency, low
temperature, or high surface charge density on macroions). Since we deal with
curved surfaces, an additional parameter, referred to as Manning parameter, is
introduced, which measures the ratio between the radius of curvature of
macroions to the Gouy-Chapman length and controls the counterion-condensation
process that directly affects the effective interactions. For sufficiently
large Manning parameters (weakly-curved surfaces), we find a strong long-ranged
attraction between two macroions that form a closely-packed bound state with
small surface-to-surface separation of the order of the counterion diameter in
agreement with recent simulations. For small Manning parameters (highly-curved
surfaces), on the other hand, the equilibrium separation increases and the
macroions unbind from each other as the confinement volume increases to
infinity. This occurs via a continuous universal unbinding transition for two
charged rods at a threshold Manning parameter of 2/3, while the transition is
discontinuous for spheres because of a pronounced potential barrier at

fact that the cross section is sensitive to both charged and neutral currents.
Thus one can simultaneously probe the electron neutrino disappearance as well
as the appearance of the other two flavors. By folding the differential cross
section with the neutrino spectrum one can study the dependence of the
oscillation parameters as a function of the electron energy. The technical
challenges to this end can be summarized as building a very large TPC capable
of detecting low energy recoils, down to a few 100 eV, within the required low

order to define the relevant vacuum state. Solutions have the
$(n-2)$-dimensional Euclidean sub-manifold whose curvature is $k=1,~0$, or -1.
In Gauss-Bonnet gravity, solutions are classified into plus and minus branches.
In the plus branch all solutions have the same asymptotic structure as those in
general relativity with a negative cosmological constant. The charge affects a
central region of the spacetime. A branch singularity appears at the finite
radius $r=r_b>0$ for any mass parameter. There the Kretschmann invariant
behaves as $O((r-r_b)^{-3})$, which is much milder than divergent behavior of
the central singularity in general relativity $O(r^{-4(n-2)})$. Some charged
black hole solutions have no inner horizon in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Although
there is a maximum mass for black hole solutions in the plus branch for $k=-1$
in the neutral case, no such maximum exists in the charged case. The solutions

inner and the ""outer"" black hole horizons. Considering the evolution of black

with respect to both a standard, local Poisson operator J and a new non-local,
skew, almost Poisson operator K, on the appropriate space; (b) can be
recursively generated from a recursion operator R (obtained by composing K and
the inverse of J.) In addition, the proof of these facts relies upon two new
pivotal resolvent identities which suggest a general method for uncovering
bi-Hamiltonian structures for other families of discrete, integrable equations.

border between differential and discrete geometry. Whereas classical
differential geometry investigates smooth geometric shapes (such as surfaces),
and discrete geometry studies geometric shapes with finite number of elements
(such as polyhedra), the discrete differential geometry aims at the development
of discrete equivalents of notions and methods of smooth surface theory.
Current interest in this field derives not only from its importance in pure
mathematics but also from its relevance for other fields like computer
graphics. Recent progress in discrete differential geometry has lead, somewhat
unexpectedly, to a better understanding of some fundamental structures lying in
the basis of the classical differential geometry and of the theory of
integrable systems. The goal of this book is to give a systematic presentation
of current achievements in this field.

The size of the ellipse is controlled with the threshold parameter: the larger
the threshold parameter, the larger return are accepted for investors as normal
fluctuations. The return vectors falling into the kernel are used for
calculation of fluctuation risk. Analogously, the data points falling outside
the kernel are used for the calculation of drawdown risks. As a result the
portfolio optimisation problem becomes three-dimensional: in addition to the
return, there are two types of risks involved. Optimal portfolio for
drawdown-averse investors is the portfolio minimising variance outside the
noise kernel. The theory has been tested with MSCI North America, Europe and
Pacific total return stock indices.

  screens","10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables",,,,"physics.class-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  An antenna prototype utilizing artificial impedance surfaces to control the
near field distribution is described. The antenna is a folded dipole placed
above a finite-size artificial impedance surface. We have found that the field
screening is most effective if the surface is a metal conductor. However, to
achieve a reasonable value of the radiation resistance the dipole should be
located far off the screen. If the surface is a magnetic wall, the antenna
design is more compact, but the field behind the screen is large. Here we
realize a compromise solution using an inductive surface of a moderate surface
impedance, which allows realization of an effective near-field screen with
still a reasonably low-profile design.

feedback between linking and similarity which is responsible for the model's
behaviour is also an important mechanism in real social networks.

dogma is the existence of density dependence mechanisms, which can be modelled
with distinct functional forms that depend on the size of the population. One
important class of regulatory functions is the $\theta$-logistic, which
generalises the logistic equation. Using this model as a motivation, this paper
introduces a simple dynamical reformulation that generalises many growth
functions. The reformulation consists of two equations, one for population
size, and one for the growth rate. Furthermore, the model shows that although
population is density-dependent, the dynamics of the growth rate does not
depend either on population size, nor on the carrying capacity. Actually, the
growth equation is uncoupled from the population size equation, and the model
has only two parameters, a Malthusian parameter $\rho$ and a competition
coefficient $\theta$. Distinct sign combinations of these parameters reproduce
not only the family of $\theta$-logistics, but also the van Bertalanffy,
Gompertz and Potential Growth equations, among other possibilities. It is also
shown that, except for two critical points, there is a general size-scaling
relation that includes those appearing in the most important allometric
theories, including the recently proposed Metabolic Theory of Ecology. With
this model, several issues of general interest are discussed such as the growth
of animal population, extinctions, cell growth and allometry, and the effect of
environment over a population.

various load conditions. Our theoretical arguments are complemented by accurate
numerical simulations, and the robustness of the model is tested via different

of games. The rules of the games suppose two parts: the preparation and
measurement. In the first part due to use of the quantum logical

functions as descriptions of their strategies. The second part consists of
classical games described by Boolean sublattices of the initial non-Boolean

transfer of the optical vortex superposition state onto an initially
