transient emission near 4680 {\AA} in Eta Car, reported earlier by Steiner &
Damineli (2004). If, as seems probable, this is He II $\lambda$4687, then it is
a unique clue to Eta Car's 5.5-year cycle. According to our analysis, several
aspects of this feature support a mass-ejection model of the observed
spectroscopic events, and not an eclipse model. The He II emission appeared in
early 2003, grew to a brief maximum during the 2003.5 spectroscopic event, and
then abruptly disappeared. It did not appear in any other HST spectra before or
after the event. The peak brightness was larger than previously reported, and
is difficult to explain even if one allows for an uncertainty factor of order
3. The stellar wind must provide a temporary larger-than-normal energy supply,
and we describe a special form of radiative amplification that may also be
needed. These characteristics are consistent with a class of mass-ejection or
wind-disturbance scenarios, which have implications for the physical structure
and stability of Eta Car.

cosmologically motivated disk-galaxy models and include the effects of
radiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and accreting
supermassive black holes. We find that during a merger, the colliding gas in
the disks is shock-heated to X-ray-emitting temperatures. The X-ray luminosity
is spatially extended, rises during the initial stages of the merger, and peaks
when the galactic centers coalesce. When a physical model for accreting black

contribute significantly to the amount and metallicity of hot gas, both of
which increase the X-ray luminosity. In terms of their stellar kinematics and
structural properties, the merger remnants in our simulations resemble
elliptical galaxies. We find that the X-ray luminosities of the remnants with
B-band luminosities in the range L_B ~ 10^10 - 10^11 Lsun are consistent with
observations, while remnants with smaller or larger masses are underluminous in
X-rays. Moreover, because the majority of the merger remnants are broadly

of galaxies was small and gas retainment more difficult. We find that
pregalactic enrichment of the IGM from 10^8-10^{10} M_sun dwarf galaxies at
6<z<12 can quantitatively explain the high cross-correlation between CIV
systems and LBGs observed at z=3. The reason is twofold. First, both LBGs and
high-z dwarfs are biased tracer of the mass distribution and form from
exceptionally high density fluctuations which are strongly clustered. Second,
the action of gravity tends to increase the spatial association between metal
bubbles and LBGs. Our analysis shows that, in order to match the abundance of
CIV systems observed at z=3, the metal bubbles generated by high-z dwarfs must
have comoving sizes of ~100 kpc. We conclude that the observed galaxy-CIV

functions). This is especially relevant given the recent advances in precision

find that the detection probability is generally maximized for I-band
observations. The signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit is weakly
dependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the sky
background, and falls very sharply for sources below sky. Therefore the number
of detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of stars with
fluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number of sources with photometric
error less a given threshold). In order to maximize the number of detections,
experiments should be tailored such that stars near sky are above the detection
threshold. Once this requirement is met, the number of detected planets is
relatively weakly dependent on the detection threshold, diameter of the
telescope, exposure time, seeing, age of the system, and planet radius. The
number of detected planets is a strongly decreasing function of the distance to
the system, implying that the nearest, richest clusters may prove to be optimal
targets.

to R ~ 70 kpc. The constituent stars lag the expected velocity of circular
orbits in the plane of the M31 disk by ~40 kms and have a velocity dispersion
of ~30 kms. The color range on the upper RGB shows a large spread indicative of
a population with a significant range of metallicity. The mean metallicity of
the population, measured from Ca II equivalent widths, is [Fe/H] = -0.9 +/-
0.2. The morphology of the structure is irregular at large radii, and shows a
wealth of substructures which must be transitory in nature, and are almost
certainly tidal debris. The presence of these substructures indicates that the
global entity was formed by accretion. This extended disk follows smoothly on
from the central parts of M31 disk with an exponential density law of
scale-length of 5.1 +/- 0.1 kpc, similar to that of the bright inner disk. The
population possesses similar kinematic and abundance properties over the entire
region where it is detected in the survey. We estimate that the structure
accounts for approximately 10% of the total luminosity of the M31 disk, and
given the huge scale, contains ~30% of the total disk angular momentum. This

hole is studied based on the two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical (2D-RHD)
simulations. The super-critical flow is composed of two parts: the disk region
and the outflow regions above and below the disk. Within the disk region the
circular motion as well as the patchy density structure are observed, which is
caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and probably by convection. The
mass-accretion rate decreases inward, roughly in proportion to the radius, and
the remaining part of the disk material leaves the disk to form outflow because
of strong radiation pressure force. We confirm that photon trapping plays an
important role within the disk. Thus, matter can fall onto the black hole at a
rate exceeding the Eddington rate. The emission is highly anisotropic and
moderately collimated so that the apparent luminosity can exceed the Eddington
luminosity by a factor of a few in the face-on view. The mass-accretion rate
onto the black hole increases with increase of the absorption opacity
(metalicity) of the accreting matter. This implies that the black hole tends to
grow up faster in the metal rich regions as in starburst galaxies or
star-forming regions.

of Damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs). The method is based on measuring the ratio
of the cross-correlation between DLAs and galaxies to the auto-correlation of
the galaxies themselves ($w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$), which is (in linear theory)
the ratio of their bias factor. This is shown to be true irrespective of the
galaxy redshift distribution, provided that one uses the same galaxies for the
two correlation functions. The method is applicable to all redshifts. Here, we
focus on z=3 DLAs and we demonstrate that the method robustly constrains the
mean DLA halo mass using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological
simulations. If we use the bias formalism of Mo & White with the DLA and galaxy
mass distributions of these simulations, we predict a bias ratio of 0.771.
Direct measurement from the simulations of $w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$ st yields a
ratio of 0.73+/-0.08, in excellent agreement with that prediction.
Equivalently, inverting the measured correlation ratio to infer a mean DLA halo
mass yields (log. averaging, in solar units) <log(M_DLA)> =11.13+/-013, in
excellent agreement with the true value in the simulations: 11.16. The cross-
correlation method thus appears to yield a robust estimate of the average host
halo mass even though the DLAs and the galaxies occupy a broad mass spectrum of
halos, and massive halos contain multiple galaxies with DLAs. We show that the
inferred mean DLA halo mass is independent of the galaxy sub-sample used, i.e.
the cross-correlation technique is also reliable. Our results imply that the
cross-correlation length between DLAs and LBGs is predicted to be, at most,
2.85 Mpc. Future observations will soon distinguish models in which DLAs are in
low mass halos from those in which DLAs are in massive halos.

hydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass
and angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars
and of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.
Neglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can
maintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that
mean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary
systems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass
receiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,
leading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely
compensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,
which leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore
the resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present
models that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we
consider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We
investigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular
momentum into the cores of accreting stars. Despite our finding that this
mechanism works, the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accreting
star ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation than in the
non-magnetic case.

clumps around the central source. These clumps exhibit a velocity gradient from
red- to blueshifted velocities toward B1-IRS, probably due to an interaction
with the outflow from an embedded protostar. The outflow and its powering
source are traced by a reflection nebula and an associated infrared point
source detected in a 2MASS K-band image. We find that this infrared point
source is associated with water maser emission distributed in an elongated

tracing the base of the outflow of the region. Ammonia emission is extended and
spatially anticorrelated with CCS. This is the first time that this kind of
anticorrelation is observed in a star forming region with such a high angular
resolution, and illustrates the importance of time-dependent chemistry on small
spatial scales. The relatively large abundance of CCS with respect to ammonia,
compared with other star forming regions, suggests an extreme youth for the

assumes that i) there is a magnetic field along the axis of the jet; ii) the

the electrons in the jet follow a power law distribution function. We have
performed Monte Carlo simulations of Compton upscattering of soft photons from
the accretion disk and have found power-law high-energy spectra with
photon-number index in the range 1.5 - 2 and cutoff at a few hundred keV. The
spectrum at long wavelengths (radio, infrared, optical) is modeled to come from
synchrotron radiation of the energetic electrons in the jet. We find flat to
inverted radio spectra that extend from the radio up to about the optical band.
For magnetic field strengths of the order of 10^5-10^6G at the base of the jet,
the calculated spectra agree well in slope and flux with the observations. Our
model has the advantage over other existing models that it also explains many
of the existing timing data such as the time lag spectra, the hardening of the
power density spectra and the narrowing of the autocorrelation function with
increasing photon energy.

electrostatic disorder results in the finite density of states on the Fermi

of tunneling through a chain of grains and discuss in detail both elastic and

tunneling at high temperature/fields. Our results are obtained within the

through a classically chaotic cavity in the presence of surface absorption.
Experimentally, surface absorption could be realized by attaching an ""absorbing
patch"" to the inner wall of the cavity. In our model, the cavity is connected
to the outside by a waveguide with N open modes (or channels), while an
experimental patch is simulated by an ""absorbing mirror"" attached to the inside
wall of the cavity; the mirror, consisting of a waveguide that supports Na
channels, with absorption inside and a perfectly reflecting wall at its end, is
described by a subunitary scattering matrix Sa. The number of channels Na, as a
measure of the geometric cross section of the mirror, and the lack of unitarity
of Sa as a measure of absorption, are under our control: these parameters have
an important physical significance for real experiments. The absorption
strength in the cavity is quantified by the trace of the lack of unitarity. The
statistical distribution of the resulting S matrix for N=1 open channel and
only one absorbing channel, Na =1, is solved analytically for the orthogonal
and unitary universality classes, and the results are compared with those
arising from numerical simulations. The relation with other models existing in
the literature, in some of which absorption has a volumetric character, is also
studied.

energy differences of distant clusters are essentially independent of the
cluster size. The Curie temperature $T_C$ is estimated directly from these
spin-flip energies in the mean field approximation. When clusters are present
estimated $T_C$ values are around 250 K independent of Mn concentration whereas
for a uniform Mn distribution we estimate a $T_C$ of about 600 K.

diagonalisation of the diffuson and cooperon vertices responsible for weak
localisation effects. We obtain general expressions for eigenvalues and

or clustering with qualitative information, which is a clustering formulation
that has been studied recently. The basic setup here is that we are given as
input a complete graph on n nodes (which correspond to nodes to be clustered)
whose edges are labeled + (for similar pairs of items) and - (for dissimilar
pairs of items). Thus we have only as input qualitative information on
similarity and no quantitative distance measure between items. The quality of a
clustering is measured in terms of its number of agreements, which is simply
the number of edges it correctly classifies, that is the sum of number of -
edges whose endpoints it places in different clusters plus the number of +
edges both of whose endpoints it places within the same cluster.
  In this paper, we study the problem of finding clusterings that maximize the
number of agreements, and the complementary minimization version where we seek
clusterings that minimize the number of disagreements. We focus on the
situation when the number of clusters is stipulated to be a small constant k.
Our main result is that for every k, there is a polynomial time approximation
scheme for both maximizing agreements and minimizing disagreements. (The
problems are NP-hard for every k >= 2.) The main technical work is for the
minimization version, as the PTAS for maximizing agreements follows along the
lines of the property tester for Max k-CUT.
  In contrast, when the number of clusters is not specified, the problem of
minimizing disagreements was shown to be APX-hard, even though the maximization
version admits a PTAS.

incoherent superposition of hundreds of millions of gravitational wave signals
radiated by inspiraling white-dwarf binaries present in our own galaxy. In
order to estimate the magnitude of the LISA response to this background, we
have simulated a synthesized population that recently appeared in the
literature. We find the amplitude of the galactic white-dwarf binary background
in the LISA data to be modulated in time, reaching a minimum equal to about
twice that of the LISA noise for a period of about two months around the time
when the Sun-LISA direction is roughly oriented towards the Autumn equinox.
Since the galactic white-dwarfs background will be observed by LISA not as a
stationary but rather as a cyclostationary random process with a period of one
year, we summarize the theory of cyclostationary random processes and present
the corresponding generalized spectral method needed to characterize such
process. We find that, by measuring the generalized spectral components of the
white-dwarf background, LISA will be able to infer properties of the
distribution of the white-dwarfs binary systems present in our Galaxy.

function, we present a model for a gravitational collapse in which a null dust

that a naked singularity is inevitably formed and its properties are quite

naked when the null dust fluid is turned off after a finite time and the field

possible family symmetries, which when combined with unification, could be
important in explaining quark, lepton and neutrino masses and mixings,
providing new results in several cases. Theoretical possibilities include
Abelian or non-Abelian, symmetric or non symmetric Yukawa matrices, Grand
Unification or not. Our main focus is on anomaly-free U(1) family symmetry
combined with SU(5) unification, although we also discuss other possibilities.
We provide a detailed phenomenological fit of the fermion masses and mixings
for several examples, and discuss the supersymmetric flavour issues in such
theories, including a detailed analysis of lepton flavour violation. We show
that it is not possible to quantitatively and decisively discriminate between
these different theoretical possibilities at the present time.

existence of a massless scalar mode, and singular behavior near it. In this
work we however focus on the finite region around it, defined by a condition
$m_\sigma=2m_\pi$. We point out that in this region the inter-hadron
interaction should be dramatically changed. Light sigma should increase
attractive mean field potentials for baryons and non-Goldstone mesons. The same
effect can be observed in additional downward shift of the mass of vector
mesons $\rho,\omega,\phi$, accessible via dilepton experiments. For pions we
predict that the mean change due to light sigma is in fact a
  $repulsive$ mean potential. The implications of these effects for collective
pion and nucleon flows, radial directed and elliptic, are estimated. Finally,
we speculate tha unusual behavior of flows observed by NA49 at 40 GeV PbPb
collisions at SPS may be explained by location of the critical point region
nearby.

dimensions. The basic idea is that brane solutions wrapped around extra
dimensions, which is allowed by string theory, will resist expansion due to
their winding mode. The momentum modes in principle work in the opposite way.
It is this interplay that leads to dynamical stabilization. We use the idea of
democratic wrapping \cite{art5}-\cite{art6}, where in a given decimation of
extra dimensions, all possible winding cases are considered. To simplify the
study further we assumed a symmetric decimation in which the total number of
extra dimensions is taken to be $Np$ where N can be called the order of the
decimation. We also assumed that extra dimensions all have the topology of
tori. We show that with these rather conservative assumptions, there exists
solutions to the field equations in which the extra dimensions are stabilized
and that the conditions do not depend on $p$. This fact means that there exists
at least one solution to the asymmetric decimation case. If we denote the
number of observed space dimensions (excluding time) by $m$, the condition for
stabilization is $m\geq 3$ for pure Einstein gravity and $m\leq 3$ for dilaton
gravity massaged by string theory parameters.

compact simple Lie group, there is a 1-parameter family of Lie 2-algebras
$\mathfrak{g}_k$ each having $\mathrm{Lie}(G)$ as its Lie algebra of objects,
but with a Jacobiator built from the canonical 3-form on $G$. There appears to
be no Lie 2-group having $\mathfrak{g}_k$ as its Lie 2-algebra, except when $k

2-group whose Lie 2-algebra is equivalent to $\mathfrak{g}_k$. The objects of
this 2-group are based paths in $G$, while the automorphisms of any object form
the level-$k$ Kac-Moody central extension of the loop group of $G$. This
2-group is closely related to the $k$th power of the canonical gerbe over $G$.
Its nerve gives a topological group that is an extension of $G$ by
$K(\mathbb{Z},2)$. When $k = \pm 1$, this topological group can also be
obtained by killing the third homotopy group of $G$. Thus, when $G =

not be continuous} for arbitrary smooth positive data. The non-negativity of
the cost-sectional curvature is shown to be equivalent to the connectedness of
the contact set between any cost-convex function (the proper generalization of
a convex function) and any of its supporting functions. When the cost-sectional

hyperbolic 3-manifold with compact connected geodesic boundary of genus g and k

prove that several elements in M_{g,k} admit non-homeomorphic hyperbolic Dehn
fillings sharing the same volume, homology, cusp volume, cusp shape, Heegaard
genus, complex length of the shortest geodesic, length of the shortest return
path, and Turaev-Viro invariants. Manifolds which share all these invariants
are called geometrically similar, and were first studied by C. D. Hodgson, R.
G. Meyerhoff and J. R. Weeks. The examples of geometrically similar manifolds
they described are commensurable with each other. We show here that many
elements in M_{g,k} admit non-commensurable geometrically similar Dehn

introduced by W. D. Neumann and A. W. Reid and studied by D. Calegary, who
provided explanations for all the previously known examples of isolation
phenomena. We show here that the cusps of any manifold M_{g,k} are
geometrically isolated from each other. Apparently, isolation of cusps in our
examples arises for different reasons from those described by Calegari.
  We also show that any element in M_{g,k} admits an infinite family of
hyperbolic Dehn fillings inducing non-trivial deformations of the hyperbolic

as they existed in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2003. In this study, we
use as data lists of shareholders for companies listed on the stock market or
on the over-the-counter market. The lengths of the shareholder lists vary with
the companies, and we use lists for the top 20 shareholders. We represent these
shareholding networks as a directed graph by drawing arrows from shareholders
to stock corporations. Consequently, the distribution of incoming edges has an
upper bound, while that of outgoing edges has no bound. This representation
shows that for all years the distributions of outgoing degrees can be well
explained by the power law function with an exponential tail. The exponent
depends on the year and the country, while the power law shape is maintained
universally. We show that the exponent strongly correlates with the long-term
shareholding rate and the cross-shareholding rate.

most recent Etna eruptions) require a quantitative description of this
phenomenon and a reliable forecasting of lava flow paths. Due to the high
complexity of these processes, numerical solution of the complete conservation
equations for real lava flows is often practically impossible. To overcome the
computational difficulties, simplified models are usually adopted, including
1-D models and cellular automata. In this work we propose a simplified 2D model
based on the conservation equations for lava thickness and depth-averaged
velocities and temperature which result in first order partial differential
equations. The proposed approach represents a good compromise between the full
3-D description and the need to decrease the computational time. The method was
satisfactorily applied to reproduce some analytical solutions and to simulate a
real lava flow event occurred during the 1991-93 Etna eruption.

primary bone tumour, if it is indeed Erwing's osteosarcoma, cannot increase in
volume beyond some critical limit without showing metastasis. We propose a
statistical method to extrapolate such critical limit to primary tumour volume.
Our model does not involve any physiological variables but rather is entirely
based on time series observations of increase in primary tumour volume from the
point of initial detection to the actual detection of metastases.

  the folding of single monomers",,,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  One of the main problems of drug design is that of optimizing the
drug--target interaction. In the case in which the target is a viral protein
displaying a high mutation rate, a second problem arises, namely the eventual
development of resistance. We wish to suggest a scheme for the design of
non--conventional drugs which do not face any of these problems and apply it to
the case of HIV--1 protease. It is based on the knowledge that the folding of
single--domain proteins, like e.g. each of the monomers forming the HIV--1--PR
homodimer, is controlled by local elementary structures (LES), stabilized by
local contacts among hydrophobic, strongly interacting and highly conserved
amino acids which play a central role in the folding process. Because LES have
evolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly interact with
each other so as to make the protein fold fast as well as to avoid aggregation
with other proteins, highly specific (and thus little toxic) as well as
effective folding--inhibitor drugs suggest themselves: short peptides (or
eventually their mimetic molecules), displaying the same amino acid sequence of
that of LES (p--LES). Aside from being specific and efficient, these inhibitors
are expected not to induce resistance: in fact, mutations which successfully
avoid their action imply the destabilization of one or more LES and thus should
lead to protein denaturation. Making use of Monte Carlo simulations within the
framework of a simple although not oversimplified model, which is able to
reproduce the main thermodynamic as well as dynamic properties of monoglobular
proteins, we first identify the LES of the HIV--1--PR and then show that the
corresponding p--LES peptides act as effective inhibitors of the folding of the
protease which do not create resistance.

Cartan decompositions on the single subsystems. The resulting decomposition,

concurrence canonical decomposition (CCD) presented in the context of
entanglement theory. The CCD is therefore extended from the case of a
multipartite system of n qubits to the case where the component subsystems have
arbitrary dimension.
