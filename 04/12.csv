nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are on the horizon. A key aim of these
datasets is to help determine the distribution of dark matter in these

highly restrictive dynamical assumptions. We describe a new, non-parametric
analysis of the kinematics of nearby dSph galaxies designed to take full
advantage of the future large datasets. The method takes as input the projected
positions and radial velocities of stars known to be members of the galaxies,
but does not use any parametric dynamical model, nor the assumption that the
mass distribution follows that of the visible matter. The problem of estimating
the radial mass distribution, M(r) (the mass interior to true radius r), is
converted into a problem of estimating a regression function
non-parametrically. From the Jeans Equation we show that the unknown regression
function is subject to fundamental shape restrictions which we exploit in our
analysis using statistical techniques borrowed from isotonic estimation and
spline smoothing. Simulations indicate that M(r) can be estimated to within a
factor of two or better with samples as small as 1000 stars over almost the
entire radial range sampled by the kinematic data. The technique is applied to
a sample of 181 stars in the Fornax dSph galaxy. We show that the galaxy
contains a significant, extended dark halo some ten times more massive than its
baryonic component. Though applied here to dSph kinematics, this approach can
be used in the analysis of any kinematically hot stellar system in which the
radial velocity field is discretely sampled.

account for the transient nature of the source. This model can be confirmed if

observed quasar LF from the distribution of peak luminosities, and show that
they differ qualitatively, unlike for the simple models of quasar lifetimes
used previously. We find that the bright end of the LF traces the intrinsic
peak quasar activity, but that the faint end consists of quasars which are
either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and higher
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the LF corresponds directly to the
maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities, which falls off at
both brighter and fainter luminosities. Our interpretation of the quasar LF
provides a physical basis for the nature and slope of the faint-end

corresponding luminosity and host-system dependent column densities, we produce
the expected soft X-ray and B-band LFs. Our predictions agree exceptionally
well with the observed LFs at all observed luminosities, over the redshift
range considered (z < 1), without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about an
obscured population of sources. Our results also suggest that observed
correlations in hard X-ray samples between the obscured fraction of quasars and

surrounding gas due to heating from accretion feedback energy as a quasar nears
its peak luminosity and final black hole mass.

question. The leading models invoke either (i) a roughly uniform jet with sharp
edges, or (ii) a jet with a narrow core and wide wings where the energy per
solid angle drops as a power law with the angle $\theta$ from the jet symmetry
axis. Recently, a two component jet model has also been considered, with a
narrow uniform jet of initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \gtrsim 100$ surrounded
by a wider uniform jet with $\Gamma_0 \sim 10-30$. Some models predict more
exotic jet profiles, such as a thin uniform ring (i.e. the outflow is bounded
by two concentric cones of half opening angle $\theta_c$ and $\theta_c +
\Delta\theta$, with $\Delta\theta \ll \theta_c$) or a fan (a thin outflow with
$\Delta\theta \ll 1$ along the rotational equator, $\theta_c = \pi/2 +
\Delta\theta/2$). In this paper we calculate the expected afterglow light
curves from such jet structures, using a simple formalism that is developed
here for this purpose, and could also have other applications. These light
curves are qualitatively compared to observations of GRB afterglows. It is
shown that the two component jet model cannot produce sharp features in the
afterglow model due to the deceleration of the wide jet or the narrow jet
becoming visible at lines of sight outside of it. We find that a ""ring"" shaped
jet or a ""fan"" shaped jet produce a jet break in the afterglow light curve that
is too shallow compared to observations, where the change in the temporal decay
index across the jet break is about half of that for a uniform conical jet. For
a ""ring"" jet, the jet break is divided into two distinct and smaller breaks,
the first occurring when $\gamma\Delta\theta \sim 1-2$ and the second when
$\gamma\theta_c \sim 1/2$.

bursts (GRBs) are thought to be powered by the rapid conversion of roughly a
solar mass' worth of gravitational binding energy into a comparatively small
amount of outgoing observable kinetic energy. A fractional absorption of the
emitted neutrinos, the particles which carry away the binding energy, by the
expelled matter is a widely discussed mechanism for powering such explosions.
Previous work addressing neutrino emission from core-collapse like environments
assumes that the outgoing neutrino spectrum closely resembles a black body
whose effective temperature is determined by both the rate of energy release
and the surface area of the entire body. Unfortunately, this assumption
minimizes the net efficiency for both neutrino-driven explosion mechanisms.
Motivated by this fact, we qualitatively outline a scenario where a hot corona
deforms the neutrino spectrum away from that of a cool thermal emitter. Our
primary result is that in principle, a coronal-driven explosion mechanism can
enhance the net efficiency of neutrino-driven SNe and GRBs by more than an
order of magnitude.

are consistent with those results. However, the direction of the linear
polarization for the J=1-0 is perpendicular to that of the CO J=2-1
polarization. This unexpected result was explored by obtaining numerical
solutions to the multilevel, radiative transfer equations for a gas with
anisotropic optical depths. We find that in addition to the anisotropic optical
depths, anisotropic excitation due to a source of radiation that is external to
the CO is needed to understand the orthogonality in the directions of
polarization. The continuum emission by dust grains at the core of DR21(OH) is
sufficient to provide this external radiation. The CO polarization must arise

disturbances in accretion flows) assuming the constant shape of the spectrum
emitted at a given radius. We consider the cases when the variability of the
flow is either coherent or incoherent between different radial zones. As
example local emission, we consider blackbody, Wien and thermal Comptonization
spectra. In addition to numerical results, we present a number of analytical
formulae for the resulting rms. We also find an analytical formula for the disc
Wien spectrum, which we find to be a very good approximation to the disc
blackbody. We compare our results to the rms spectrum observed in an ultrasoft
state of GRS 1915+105.

indistinguishable from ellipticals at z = 0. Also, their isophotal shapes
appear very similar to those observed for nearby ellipticals, in that the
percentages of disky and boxy galaxies at z ~ 1 are close to the values

early-type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearby
ellipticals, i.e. disky ellipticals have generally higher characteristic
ellipticities, and boxy ellipticals have larger half-light radii and are
brighter in the restframe B band. In this respect then, no significant
structural differences are seen for ellipticals between z = 0 and 1.

effect of pre-heating on the entropy structure of the ICM. Our simulations
account for non-gravitational heating of the gas either by imposing a minimum
entropy floor at redshift z=3, or by considering feedback by galactic winds
powered by supernova (SN) energy. In the adiabatic simulations we find that the
entropy is increased out to the external regions as a consequence of the
transition from clumpy to smooth accretion induced by extra heating. This
result is in line with the predictions of the semi-analytical model by Voit et
al. However, the introduction of radiative cooling substantially reduces this
entropy amplification effect. While galactic winds of increasing strength are
effective in regulating star formation, they have a negligible effect on the
entropy profile of cluster-sized halos. Only in models where the action of the
winds is complemented with diffuse heating corresponding to a pre-collapse
entropy do we find a sizable entropy amplification out to the virial radius of
the groups. Observational evidence for entropy amplification in the outskirts
of galaxy clusters and groups therefore favours a scenario for feedback that
distributes heating energy in a more diffuse way than predicted by the model
for galactic winds from SN explosions explored here.

Compact Array, of two dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) in the Fornax cluster:
FCC032 and FCC336. The optical positions and velocities of these galaxies place
them well within the Fornax cluster. FCC032 was detected at the 3sigma
significance level with a total HI flux density of 0.66+-0.22 Jy km s^-1 or an
HI mass of 5.0+-1.7 10^7 h_75^-2 M_sun. Based on our deep Halpha+[NII]
narrow-band images, obtained with FORS2 mounted on the VLT, this dE was already
known to contain 600-1800 h_75^-2 M_sun of ionised Hydrogen (depending on the
relative strengths of the Halpha and [NII] emission lines). Hence, this is the
first study of the complex, multi-phase interstellar medium of a dE outside the
Local Group. FCC336 was detected at the same significance level: 0.37+-0.10 Jy
km s^-1 or a total HI mass of 2.8+-0.7 10^7 h_75^-2,M_sun. Using a compilation
of HI data of dwarf galaxies, we find that the observed high HI-mass boundary
of the distribution of dIrrs, BCDs, and dEs in a log(L_B) versus log (M_HI)
diagram is in good agreement with a simple chemical evolution model with
continuous star formation. The existence of many gas-poor dEs (undetected at
21cm) suggest that the environment (or more particularly, a galaxy's orbit
within a cluster) also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of gas in
present-day dEs. E.g., FCC032 and FCC336 are located in the sparsely populated
outskirts of the Fornax cluster. This is in agreement with HI surveys of dEs in
the Virgo Cluster and an Halpha survey of the Fornax Cluster, which also tend
to place gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the cluster periphery.

arcsecond-resolution (~< 400 AU in radius). Vibrationally excited transitions
of SO, SO2 and HCN with energy levels up to 1800 K were also observed. In
addition to the other organic molecules (HC3N, CH2CO, CH3OH, CH2CHCN and
HCOOCH3) previously reported by us (Kuan et al. 2004), these results clearly
indicate the existence of a rich organic chemistry in low-mass `hot corinos'.
  From the observation of optically thin HC15N emission, we conclude I16293A is
a rotating circumstellar disk lying along the north-south direction ~10 deg to
the east and with an inclination ~30 deg to the sky. We suggest that the
observed vibrational SO and SO2 emission may originate from shock waves near or
in the circumstellar disks. Between the two cores, we find a strong
anticorrelation in emission from C2H5OH and C2H5CN. The relative contribution
of gas phase and grain-surface chemistries to the production of the observed
complex molecules is discussed. We point out the shortcomings underlying recent
claims that all the O-bearing organics are formed on grains.
  The presence of so many well-known interstellar molecules in solar-type hot
corinos strengthens the link between molecular cloud chemistry, the starting
materials of protoplanetary disks such as the protosolar nebula, and the
composition of comets. Establishing the fine details of this connection is

We evaluate the size of this effect both in a linear chain and in a square

Hamiltonian onto the time scale we derive the perturbing source current which

function of the electron hopping value and of the phonon spectrum parameters.
We derive the {\it e-ph} corrections to the phonon free energy and show that
its temperature derivatives do not depend on the {\it e-ph} effective coupling

upturn in the low temperature total heat capacity over $T$ ratio is attributed

that when fermionic atoms form a condensate that can be externally tuned

spin susceptibility of the fermionic gas are non-analytic functions of the
two-body bound state energy. This non-analyticity is due to a massive
rearrangement of the momentum distribution in the ground state of the system.
Furthermore, we show that the low temperature superfluid density is also
non-analytic, and exhibits a dramatic change in behavior when the critical
value of the bound state energy is crossed.

there is a crossover length xi approx equal to T^{-nu}, such that on length

There is a scaling relation theta=-1/nu, and we provide several arguments that

safety critical applications including, for example, medical diagnostics. In
such applications the uncertainty of classification can be reliably estimated
within a Bayesian model averaging technique that allows the use of prior
information. Decision Tree (DT) classification models used within such a
technique gives experts additional information by making this classification
scheme observable. The use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology
of stochastic sampling makes the Bayesian DT technique feasible to perform.
However, in practice, the MCMC technique may become stuck in a particular DT
which is far away from a region with a maximal posterior. Sampling such DTs
causes bias in the posterior estimates, and as a result the evaluation of
classification uncertainty may be incorrect. In a particular case, the negative
effect of such sampling may be reduced by giving additional prior information
on the shape of DTs. In this paper we describe a new approach based on sweeping
the DTs without additional priors on the favorite shape of DTs. The
performances of Bayesian DT techniques with the standard and sweeping
strategies are compared on a synthetic data as well as on real datasets.
Quantitatively evaluating the uncertainty in terms of entropy of class
posterior probabilities, we found that the sweeping strategy is superior to the
standard strategy.

orbifold, give a natural framework to unify the gauge bosons, Higgs fields and
even the matter fields in a single multiplet of the unifying gauge symmetry.
The extra dimensions and the supersymmetry are the two key ingredients for such
an unification. In this work, we investigate various scenarios for the
unification of the three gauge couplings, and the Yukawa couplings in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), as well as the trilinear Higgs
couplings \lambda and \kappa of the Non-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(NMSSM). We present an SU(8) model in six dimensions with N=2 supersymmetry,
compactified in a T^2/Z_6 orbifold which unifies the three gauge couplings with
\lambda and \kappa of NMSSM. Then, we present an SU(9) model in 6D, which, in
addition, includes partial unification of Yukawa couplings, either for the
up-type (top quark and Dirac tau-neutrino) or down-type (bottom quark and tau
lepton). We also study the phenomenological implications of these various
unification scenarios using the appropriate renormalization group equations,
and show that such unification works very well with the measured low energy
values of the couplings. The predicted upper bounds for the lightest neutral
Higgs boson mass in our model is higher than those in MSSM, but lower that
those in the general NMSSM (where the couplings \lambda and \kappa are
arbitrary). Some of the predictions of our models can be tested in the upcoming
Large Hadron Collider.

studying strings in the O-plane orbifold, where we show that some winding

The one-loop string partition function has infrared divergences associated to
the condensation of these states.

Euclidean space which has *two different Lorentzian interpretations*, one of
which is a model of an *accelerating cosmology*. We describe in detail how to
implement this idea without resorting to a ""complex metric"". We show that the
four-dimensional version of the OVV cosmology is null geodesically incomplete
but has no curvature singularity; also that it is [barely] stable against the
Seiberg-Witten process [nucleation of brane pairs]. The introduction of matter
satisfying the Null Energy Condition has the paradoxical effect of both
stabilizing the spacetime and rendering it genuinely singular. We show however
that it is possible to arrange for an effective violation of the NEC in such a
way that the singularity is avoided and yet the spacetime remains stable. The
possible implications for the early history of these cosmologies are discussed.

particles moving on a one-dimensional lattice. Particles tend to separate from
each other, and evolution ceases when at least one empty site is found between
any two particles. Motion is a mixture of diffusion to nearest-neighbour sites
and long-range jumps, known as annealed small-world propagation. The long-range
jump probability plays the role of the small-world disorder. We show that there
is an optimal value of this probability, for which the segregation process is
fastest. Moreover, above a critical probability, the time needed to reach a
fully segregated state diverges for asymptotically large systems. These special
values of the long-range jump probability depend crucially on the particle
density. Our system is a novel example of the rare dynamical processes with
critical behaviour at a finite value of the small-world disorder.

this structural property is not clearly understood. One way of studying the
dynamical process is to compare the metabolic networks of species that have
arisen at different points in evolution and hence are related to each other to
varying extents. We have compared the reaction sets of each metabolite across
and within 15 groups of species. For a given pair of species and a given
metabolite, the number $\Delta k$ of reactions of the metabolite that appear in
the metabolic network of only one species and not the other is a measure of the
distance between the two networks. While $\Delta k$ is small within groups of
related species and large across groups, we find its probability distribution
to be $\sim (\Delta k)^{-\gamma'}$ where $\gamma'$ is a universal exponent that
is the same within and across groups. This exponent equals, upto statistical
uncertainties, the exponent $\gamma$ in the scale free degree distribution
$\sim k^{-\gamma}$. We argue that this, as well as our finding that $\Delta k$
is approximately linearly correlated with the degree $k$ of the metabolite, is
evidence of a `proportionate change' process in evolution. We also discuss some
molecular mechanisms that might be responsible for such an evolutionary

time can't exist; still the theorem's meaning is usually interpreted
intolerably wide. The concept of hidden time (and, in general, hidden
space-time) is introduced. Such concept provides a whole new class of physical
theories, fully compatible with current knowledge, but giving new tremendous
possibilities. Those theories do not violate Bell's theorem.

call the $\chi$- and $\mathcal{S}$-matrices -- of a quantum operation and their
applications. The matrices defined with respect to an arbitrary operator basis,
that is, the orthonormal basis for the space of linear operators on the state
space are considered for a general operation acting on a single or two
\textit{d}-level quantum system (qudit). We show that the two matrices are
given by the expansion coefficients of the Liouville superoperator as well as
the associated bijective, positive operator on the doubled-space defined with
respect to two types of induced operator basis having different tensor product
structures, i.e., Kronecker products of the relevant operator basis and dyadic
products of the associated bipartite state basis. The explicit conversion
formulas between the two matrices are established as a computable matrix
multiplication. Extention to more qudits case is trivial. Several applications
of these matrices and the conversion formulas in quantum information science
and technology are presented.

"quant-ph/0504092","Lutz Polley","L. Polley","""Measurement"" by neuronal tunneling: Implications of Born's rule","8 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A non-collapse scenario for ``conscious'' selection of a term from a
superposition was proposed in quant-ph/0309166: thermally assisted tunneling of
neuronal pore molecules. But ``observers'' consisting of only two neurons
appear to be at odds with Born's rule. In the present paper, an observer is
assumed to possess a large number of auxilliary properties irrelevant for the
result of the measurement. Born's rule then reduces to postulating that, prior
to the result becoming conscious, irrelevant properties are in an entangled
state with maximum likelihood, in the sense that phase-equivalent entanglements
cover a maximal fraction of the unit sphere (leading to equal-amplitude
superpositions).

resonator in the strong coupling regime. Using a semiclassical description for
the atom and field dynamics, we derive a closed system of differential
equations to describe this coupled atom-field dynamics. For sufficiently strong
pumping the system starts lasing when the atom gets close to a field antinode,
and the associated light forces provide for self-trapping of the atom. For a
cavity mode blue detuned with respect to the atomic transition frequency this
is combined with cavity induced motional cooling allowing for long term
steady-state operation of such a laser. The analytical results for temperature
and field statistics agree well with our earlier predictions based on Quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. We find sub-Doppler temperatures that decrease with
gain and coupling strength and can even go beyond the limit of passive cavity
cooling. Besides demonstrating the importance of light forces in single-atom
lasers, this result also gives strong evidence to enhance laser cooling through
stimulated emission in resonators.
