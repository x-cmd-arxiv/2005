quadrupole (elliptical) shapes in background galaxy images. Small impact
parameter (a few kpc) gravitational lensing by foreground core masses between 2
10^{9} and 2 10^{12} M_\odot will additionally induce a sextupole shape with
the quadrupole and sextupole minima aligned. This correlation in relative
orientation of the quadrupole and sextupole provides a sensitive method to
identify images which have been slightly curved by lensing events. A general
theoretical framework for sextupole lensing is developed which includes several
low order coefficients in a general lensing map. Tools to impute map
coefficients from the galaxy images are described and applied to the north
Hubble deep field. Instrumental PSFs, camera charge diffusion, and image
composition methods are modelled in the coefficient determination process.
Estimates of Poisson counting noise for each galaxy are used to cut galaxies
with signals too small to reliably establish curvature. Curved galaxies are
found to be spatially clumped, as would be expected if the curving were due to
small impact parameter lensing by localized ensembles of dark matter haloes.
Simulations provide an estimate of the total required lensing mass and the
acceptable mass range of the constituent haloes. The overdensities and
underdensities of visible galaxies and their locations in the Hubble foreground
is found to be consistent with our observations and their interpretation as
lensing events.

our basic understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheric physics. Although a range of

we can effectively separate the two groups. The dead systems are among the most
massive at z~2.5 (mean stellar mass <M*> = 0.8 x 10^11 Msun) and likely formed
most of their stellar mass at z>5. To a limit of 0.5 x 10^11 Msun their number
density is ~10 x lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we
use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J, H, and K fluxes.

rest-frame K-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L_K), implying that even a Spitzer 8

average M/L_K of the DRGs is about three times higher than that of the LBGs,

increases largely with the decrease of redshift, and the RSI-CDM model can
suppress the mass abundance on any scale of halo masses at higher redshift. As
for the largest mass of virialized halos, the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM

suppresses the localization of lone-pair electrons on chalcogen atoms, and
localized states at the top of the valence band are due to Cu 3d orbitals.

a local expression relating the dynamic parameters and the rate of convergence
arises. Such results link the convexity analysis of the potential energy and

perturbations of matter, which may be large; $I(\xi)$ does not contain the
second order derivatives of the perturbed metric. The superpotential is
identically zero when perturbations are absent.
  By integrating conserved vectors over a part $\Si$ of a hypersurface $S$ of
the background, which spans a two-surface $\di\Si$, we obtain integral
relations between, on the one hand, initial data of the perturbed metric
components and the energy-momentum perturbations on $\Si$ and, on the other

integral relations as there are different mappings, $\xi$'s, $\Si$'s and
$\di\Si$'s. For given boundary values on $\di\Si$, the integral relations may
be interpreted as integral constraints (e.g., those of Traschen) on local
initial data including the energy-momentum perturbations. Conservation laws
expressed in terms of Killing fields $\Bar\xi$ of the background become

  (Adviser: Masayasu Harada)",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th",,"  Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is one of the most important features in
low-energy QCD. The chiral symmetry is expected to be restored at very high
temperature and/or density. Accompanied by the chiral phase transition,
properties of hadrons will be changed especially near the critical point. The
study of the phenomena associated with the chiral phase transition will give us
some clues on the connection between the chiral symmetry and the low-energy
hadron dynamics.
  We develop the theory based on the hidden local symmetry (HLS) at finite
temperature, which is an effective field theory of QCD and includes pions and
vector mesons as the dynamical degrees of freedom, and study the chiral phase
transition in hot matter. We show that the chiral symmetry is restored as the
vector manifestation (VM), in which the massless degenerate pion (and its
flavor partners) and the longitudinal $\rho$ meson (and its flavor partners) as
the chiral partner. We also present several predictions based on the VM. We
estimate the critical temperature $T_c$ and show the following phenomena near
$T_c$: the vector charge susceptibility becomes equal to the axial-vector
charge susceptibility; the vector dominance of the electromagnetic form factor
of the pion is largely violated; the pion velocity is close to the speed of
light. Furthermore, we show that the remnant of the VM can be clearly seen in
the system of heavy mesons. We expect that the VM and its predictions are
testable by current and future experiments and the lattice analysis.

interacting particles. In the first part of the book ""Quantum electrodynamics""
we follow rather traditional approach to particle physics. Our discussion
proceeds systematically from the principle of relativity and postulates of
quantum measurements to the renormalization in quantum electrodynamics. In the
second part of the book ""Quantum theory of particles"" this traditional approach
is reexamined. We find that formulas of special relativity should be modified
to take into account particle interactions. We also suggest reinterpreting
quantum field theory in the language of physical ""dressed"" particles. This
formulation eliminates the need for renormalization and opens up a new way for
studying dynamical and bound state properties of quantum interacting systems.
The developed theory is applied to realistic physical objects and processes
including the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the decay law of moving
unstable particles, and the electric field of relativistic electron beams.
These results force us to take a fresh look at some core issues of modern
particle theories, in particular, the Minkowski space-time unification, the
role of quantum fields and renormalization as well as the alleged impossibility
of action-at-a-distance. A new perspective on these issues is suggested. It can
help to solve the old problem of theoretical physics -- a consistent
unification of relativity and quantum mechanics.

quantum state was found to be analogous to an x-rotation of a large spin. In
this paper we extend the analogy further to demonstrate geometric effects by
performing rotations on the spin. Such effects can be used to determine
properties of the chain, such as its length, in a robust manner. Alternatively,
they can form the basis of a spin network quantum computer. We demonstrate a
universal set of gates in such a system by both dynamical and geometrical
means.

Gen. 38 (2005) 4715--4725","10.1088/0305-4470/38/21/015",,"quant-ph",,"  Using the intertwining relation we construct a pseudosuperpartner for a
(non-Hermitian) Dirac-like Hamiltonian describing a two-level system
interacting in the rotating wave approximation with the electric component of
an electromagnetic field. The two pseudosuperpartners and pseudosupersymmetry
generators close a quadratic pseudosuperalgebra. A class of time dependent
electric fields for which the equation of motion for a two level system placed
in this field can be solved exactly is obtained. New interesting phenomenon is
observed. There exists such a time-dependent detuning of the field frequency
from the resonance value that the probability to populate the excited level
ceases to oscillate and becomes a monotonically growing function of time
tending to 3/4. It is shown that near this fixed excitation regime the
probability exhibits two kinds of oscillations. The oscillations with a small
amplitude and a frequency close to the Rabi frequency (fast oscillations) take
place at the background of the ones with a big amplitude and a small frequency
(slow oscillations). During the period of slow oscillations the minimal value
of the probability to populate the excited level may exceed 1/2 suggesting for
an ensemble of such two-level atoms the possibility to acquire the inverse
population and exhibit lasing properties.

Slomczy\'nski (J. Phys. A 34, 6689 [2001]) and of Petz and Sudar (J. Math.
Phys. 37, 2262 [1996]). In the former work, a metric (the Monge one,
specifically) over generalized Husimi distributions was employed to define a
distance between two arbitrary density matrices. In the Petz-Sudar work
(completing a program of Chentsov), the quantum analogue of the (classically
unique) Fisher information (montone) metric of a probability simplex was
extended to define an uncountable infinitude of Riemannian (also monotone)
metrics on the set of positive definite density matrices. We pose here the
questions of what is the specific/unique Fisher information metric for the
(classically-defined) Husimi distributions and how does it relate to the
infinitude of (quantum) metrics over the density matrices of Petz and Sudar? We
find a highly proximate (small relative entropy) relationship between the
probability distribution (the quantum Jeffreys' prior) that yields quantum
universal data compression, and that which (following Clarke and Barron) gives
its classical counterpart. We also investigate the Fisher information metrics
corresponding to the escort Husimi, positive-P and certain Gaussian probability
distributions, as well as, in some sense, the discrete Wigner
pseudoprobability. The comparative noninformativity of prior probability
distributions -- recently studied by Srednicki (Phys. Rev. A 71, 052107 [2005])
-- formed by normalizing the volume elements of the various information
metrics, is also discussed in our context.

generalizes the relationship between Subset Sum and the HSP in the dihedral
