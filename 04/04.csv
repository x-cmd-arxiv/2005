top of degenerate cold white dwarfs are very effective tools for the study of
critical, non spherically symmetric, behaviors during the early stages of nova
outbursts. Such models can shed light both on the mechanism responsible for the
heavy element enrichment observed to characterize nova envelope matter and on
the role of perturbations during the early stages of ignition of the runaway.
The complexity of convective reactive flow in multi-dimensions makes the
computational model itself complex and sensitive to the details of the
numerics. In this study, we demonstrate that the imposed outer boundary
condition can have a dramatic effect on the solution. Several commonly used
choices for the outer boundary conditions are examined. It is shown that the
solutions obtained from Lagrangian simulations, where the envelope is allowed
to expand and mass is being conserved, are consistent with spherically
symmetric solutions. In Eulerian schemes which utilize an outer boundary
condition of free outflow, the outburst can be artificially quenched.

I protostellar phases, we reexamine the case of spherical isothermal collapse
in the case of a finite mass reservoir. The presence of a core boundary results
in the generation of an inward propagating rarefaction wave. This steepens the
gas density profile from r^{-2} to r^{-3} or steeper. After a protostar forms,
the mass accretion rate \dot{M} evolves through three distinct phases: (1) an
early phase of decline in \dot{M}, which is a non-self-similar effect due to
spatially nonuniform infall in the prestellar phase; (2) for large cores, an
intermediate phase of near-constant \dot{M} from the infall of the outer part
of the self-similar density profile; (3) a late phase of rapid decline in
\dot{M} when accretion occurs from the region affected by the inward
propagating rarefaction wave. Our model clouds of small to intermediate size
make a direct transition from phase (1) to phase (3) above. Both the first and
second phase are characterized by a temporally increasing bolometric luminosity
L_bol, while L_bol is decreasing in the third (final) phase. We identify the
period of temporally increasing L_bol with the Class 0 phase, and the later
period of terminal accretion and decreasing L_bol with the Class I phase. The
peak in L_bol corresponds to the evolutionary time when 50% \pm 10% of the
cloud mass has been accreted by the protostar. This is in agreement with the
classification scheme proposed by Andre et al. (1993). We show how our results
can be used to explain tracks of envelope mass M_env versus L_bol for
protostars in Taurus and Ophiuchus. We also develop an analytic formalism which
reproduces the protostellar accretion rate.

us to the detection of at least 30 modes of pulsation of which 22 are

attributed to the high-order g modes. As both kinds of pulsations are observed

finite viscosity case, the continuous spectrum is regularized and we can
calculate the quasi-normal modes for stellar models that do not admit solutions
at first order in perturbation theory when the coupling between the polar and
axial perturbations is neglected. The viscous damping time is found to agree
within factor 2 with the usual estimate obtained by using the eigenfunctions of
the inviscid limit and some approximation for the energy dissipation integrals.
We find that the frequencies and viscous damping times for relativistic
$r-$modes lie between the Newtonian and Cowling results. We compare the results
obtained with homogeneous, polytropic and realistic equations of state and find
that the frequencies depend only on the rotation rate and on the compactness
parameter (M/R), being almost independent of the equation of state. Our
numerical results for realistic neutron stars give viscous damping times with
the same dependence on mass and radius as previously estimated, but
systematically larger of about 60%.

amplification. The density shows a double-peaked PDF, consistent with the
cooling curve that was used. The PDF of the magnetic field shows a high-end
tail, providing a tell-tale signature of the operation of the small scale
dynamo. The magnetic field strength correlates positively with the density. As
a result, the field amplification takes place more vigorously in the lower
temperature, denser gas. The Lagrangian chaos in the simulated turbulent flows
is studied in substantial detail. It is shown that the stretching rate of
material lines as well as the Lyapunov exponents can be used to gain important
insights into the growth of magnetic field. The cancellation exponent for the
small scale supernova-driven dynamo is derived and it is shown that
constructive folding of field lines in the dynamo is very inefficient. We also
show that our Lagrangian approach can yield actual measures of the turbulent
diffusivity in the simulated ISM. The turbulent diffusivity provides insights
into the mixing of elements from supernova ejecta on macroscopic scales. The
high rates of line stretching in interstellar turbulence suggests that the

emission mechanisms in LLAGNs. We detect variability on typical time scales of
a few days, at a confidence level of 99%, in half of the target galaxies.
Either variability that is intrinsic to the radio emitting regions, or that is
caused by scintillation in the Galactic interstellar medium, is consistent with
the data. For either interpretation, the brightness temperature of the emission

of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without referring to the delayed emission of the
early afterglow. Under the assumption that the afterglow of the bursts
concerned occurs well before the prompt emission dies away, the Lorentz factor
measured at the time when the duration of the prompt emission is ended could be
estimated by applying the well-known relations of GRB jets. With the concept of
the efficiency for converting the explosion energy to radiation, this Lorentz
factor can be related to the initial Lorentz factor of the source. The
corresponding rest frame peak energy can accordingly be calculated. Applying
this method, we estimate the initial Lorentz factor of the bulk motion and the
corresponding rest frame spectral peak energy of GRBs for a new sample where
the redshift and the break time in the afterglow are known. Our analysis shows
that, in the circumstances, the initial Lorentz factor of the sample would peak
at 200 and would be distributed mainly within $(100,400)$, and the peak of the
distribution of the corresponding rest frame peak energy would be $0.8keV$ and
its main region would be $(0.3keV,3keV)$.

new opportunities to uncover the deepest aspects of the Kondo effect, one of
the paradigmatic phenomena in the physics of strongly correlated electrons.
Artificial single-impurity Kondo systems have been realized in various

individual molecules. The Kondo effect is usually regarded as a spin-related
phenomenon, namely the coherent exchange of the spin between a localized state
and a Fermi sea of electrons. In principle, however, the role of the spin could
be replaced by other degrees of freedom, such as an orbital quantum number.
Here we demonstrate that the unique electronic structure of carbon nanotubes
enables the observation of a purely orbital Kondo effect. We use a magnetic
field to tune spin-polarized states into orbital degeneracy and conclude that
the orbital quantum number is conserved during tunneling. When orbital and spin
degeneracies are simultaneously present, we observe a strongly enhanced Kondo
effect, with a multiple splitting of the Kondo resonance at finite field and
predicted to obey a so-called SU(4) symmetry.

roles on their physical quantities. Recent development of resonant x-ray
scattering (RXS) at the K-edge of transition metals, however, casts light on
the 4p states, because the signals on orbital and magnetic superlattice spots
are brought about by the modulation in the 4p states. The 4p states are
extending in solids and thereby sensitive to electronic states at neighboring
sites. This characteristic determines the mechanism of RXS that the intensity
on the orbital superlattice spots are mainly generated by the lattice
distortion and those on magnetic superlattice spots by the coupling of the 4p
states with the orbital polarization in the 3d states at neighboring sites.
Taking up typical examples for orbital and magnetic RXS, we demonstrate these
mechanisms on the basis of the band structure calculation. Finally, we study
the MCD spectra at the K-edge, demonstrating that the same mechanism as the

meV which is smaller than the prediction of our band theory, 112 meV. In
addition, an intensity enhancement of $both$ A and B has been observed,
although B is not crossing $E_{\rm F}$. Those two facts are apparently
incompatible with the simple rigid-band shift due to electron doping. We point

ferromagnetic grains disposed in the nodes of a 3D crystal lattice are embedded
in a matrix with different ferromagnetic properties. Frequency ranges forbidden
to spin wave propagation are found in the calculated magnonic spectra. Both the
position and the width of the gaps are found to depend on the magnetic
(exchange and magnetization) contrasts in the composite material, as well as on
its structural parameters (filling fraction, crystal lattice type). Having
applied our theory to interpretation of the existence of a spin wave gap in
doped manganites, recently revealed in neutron scattering experiments by S.
Hennion {\em et al.}, we obtained a good (though approximate) quantitative
agreement with the experimental results. A working hypothesis is proposed on
this basis, supposing that certain manganites can be treated as natural 3D
magnonic crystals.

commutation relation $[x^\mu,x^\nu]=i\Theta^{\mu\nu}(x)$, where the
noncommutativity parameters $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ depend on the position
coordinates $x$. We do this by adopting Rieffel's deformation theory
(originally formulated for constant $\Theta$ and which includes the Moyal
product as a particular case) and find that, for a topology $R^2 \times R^2$,
there is only one class of such products which are associative. It corresponds
to a noncommutativity matrix whose canonical form has components
$\Theta^{12}=-\Theta^{21}=0$ and $\Theta^{34}=-\Theta^{43}= \theta(x^1,x^2)$,
with $\th(x^1,x^2)$ an arbitrary positive smooth bounded function. In Minkowski
space-time, this describes a position-dependent space-like or magnetic
noncommutativity. We show how to generalize our construction to $n\geq 3$
arbitrary dimensions and use it to find traveling noncommutative lumps
generalizing noncommutative solitons discussed in the literature. Next we
consider Euclidean $\lambda\phi^4$ field theory on such a noncommutative
background. Using a zeta-like regulator, the covariant perturbation method and
working in configuration space, we explicitly compute the UV singularities. We
find that, while the two-point UV divergences are non-local, the four-point UV
divergences are local, in accordance with recent results for constant $\Theta$.

(flat connection) as it would appear in a mass term a` la Stueckelberg. However
the paper is limited to the case where only the flat connection is present (no
field strength term). The perturbative solution is constructed by using only
the functional equations and by expanding in the number of loops. In particular
we do not use a perturbative approach based on the path integral or on a
canonical quantization. It is shown that there is no solution with trivial
S-matrix.
  Then the model is embedded in a nonlinear sigma model. The solution is
constructed by exploiting a natural hierarchy in the functional equations given
by the number of insertions of the flat connection and of the constrained
component of the sigma field. The amplitudes with the sigma field are simply
derived from those of the flat connection and of the constraint component.
Unitarity is enforced by hand by using Feynman rules. We demonstrate the
remarkable fact that in generic dimensions the naive Feynman rules yield
amplitudes that satisfy the functional equations. This allows a dimensional
renormalization of the theory in D=4 by recursive subtractions of the poles in
the Laurent expansion. Thus one gets a finite theory depending only on two
parameters.
  The novelty of the paper is the use of the functional equation associated to
the local left multiplication introduced by Faddeev and Slavnov, here improved
by adding the external source coupled to the constrained component. It gives a
powerful tool to renormalize the nonlinear sigma model.

calculus on Heisenberg manifolds. More precisely, the principal symbol of a
\psivdo appears as a homogeneous section over the linear dual of the tangent
Lie algebra bundle of the manifold. This definition is an important step
towards using global $K$-theoretic tools in the Heisenberg setting, such as
those involved in the elliptic setting for proving the Atiyah-Singer index
theorem or the regularity of the eta invariant. On the other hand, the
intrinsic definition of the principal symbol enables us to give an intrinsic
sense to the model operator of \psivdo at point and to give a definitive proof
that the Heisenberg calculus is modelled at each point by the calculus of
left-invariant \psidos on the tangent group at the point. This also allows us
to define an intrinsic Rockland condition for \psivdos which is shown to be
equivalent to the invertibility of the principal symbol, provided that the Levi
form has constant rank. Furthermore, we review the main hypoellipticity results
on Heisenberg manifolds in terms of the results of the paper. In particular, we
complete the treatment of the Kohn Laplacian by Beals-Greiner and establish
that for the horizontal sublaplacian the invertibility of the principal symbol
is equivalent to some condition on the Levi form, called condition $X(k)$.

closed 3-manifolds using a finite dimensional variational method whose energy
function is the volume. The concept of an angle structure on a tetrahedron and
on a triangulated closed 3-manifold is introduced following the work of Casson,
Murakami and Rivin. It is proved by A. Kitaev and the author that any closed
3-manifold has a triangulation supporting an angle structure. The moduli space
of all angle structures on a triangulated 3-manifold is a bounded open convex
polytope in a Euclidean space. The volume of an angle structure is defined.
Both the angle structure and the volume are natural generalizations of
tetrahedra in the constant sectional curvature spaces and their volume. It is
shown that the volume functional can be extended continuously to the compact
closure of the moduli space. In particular, the maximum point of the volume
functional always exists in the compactification. The main result shows that
for a 1-vertex triangulation of a closed
  3-manifold if the volume function on the moduli space has a local maximum
point, then either the manifold admits a constant curvature Riemannian metric
or the manifold contains a non-separating 2-sphere or real projective plane.

the correlations overcounting inherent to the RPA formalism. One-body density
matrix elements in the uncorrelated (i.e. Hartree-Fock) and correlated (i.e.
RPA) ground states are then challenged in proton scattering studies based on
the Melbourne microscopic optical model to highlight the role played by the RPA
correlations. Effects of such correlations which deplete the nuclear matter at

more and more sizeable as the incident energy increases. Illustrations are

sides of the windows except for a central area to let the laser beams in and
out of the cell. This allows very efficient application of the electric field,

The technique used to attach the monocrystalline sapphire windows to the cell
body causes minimal stress birefringence in the windows. In addition,
reflection losses at the windows can be made very small. The vapor cell
operates with no buffer gas and has no magnetic part. The use of this kind of

penalty associated with the brush modifies both the hybridization isotherms and
the rate equations: the attainable hybridization is lowered significantly as is
the hybridization rate. While the equilibrium hybridization fraction, $x_{eq}$,

Displacement operators in this phase space are introduced and their properties
are studied. Wigner and Weyl functions in this context are also considered and
their physical interpretation and properties are discussed. All results are
compared and contrasted with the corresponding ones for the harmonic oscillator
in the $R \times R$ phase space.

Rev. A 72, 062311 (2005) [5 pages]","10.1103/PhysRevA.72.062311",,"quant-ph",,"  Even though the time-reversal is unphysical (it corresponds to the complex
conjugation of the density matrix), for some restricted set of states it can be
achieved unitarily, typically when there is a common de-phasing in a n-level
system. However, in the presence of multiple phases (i. e. a different
de-phasing for each element of an orthogonal basis occurs) the time reversal is
no longer physically possible. In this paper we derive the channel which
optimally approaches in fidelity the time-reversal of multi-phase equatorial
states in arbitrary (finite) dimension. We show that, in contrast to the
customary case of the Universal-NOT on qubits (or the universal conjugation in
arbitrary dimension), the optimal phase covariant time-reversal for equatorial
states is a nonclassical channel, which cannot be achieved via a
measurement/preparation procedure. Unitary realizations of the optimal
time-reversal channel are given with minimal ancillary dimension, exploiting
the simplex structure of the optimal maps.

to the fact that, like in classical physics, any realistic system is subjected
to a coupling to an uncontrollable environment which influences it in a
non-negligible way. The theory of open quantum systems thus plays a major role
in many applications of quantum physics since perfect isolation of quantum
system is not possible and since a complete microscopic description or control
of the environment degrees of freedom is not feasible or only partially so""
[1]. Practical considerations therefore force one to seek for a simpler,
effectively probabilistic description in terms of an open system. There is a
close physical and mathematical connection between the evolution of an open
system, the state changes induced by quantum measurements, and the classical
notion of a stochastic process. The paper provides a bibliographic review of
this interrelations, it shows the mathematical equivalence between markovian
master equation and generalized piecewise deterministic processes [1] and it
introduces the open system in an open observed environment model.
