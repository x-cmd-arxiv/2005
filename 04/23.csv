XMM-Newton deep (200ks) field. In order to constrain the absorbed AGN
population, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulations to directly compare the
X-ray colours of observed sources with those predicted by several model
distributions. We have tested the simplest form of the AGN unified scheme,
whereby the intrinsic XLF of absorbed AGN is set to be the same as that of
their unabsorbed brethren, coupled with various model distributions of
absorption. The best fitting of these models sets the fraction of AGN with
absorbing column NH, proportional to (logNH)^8. We have also tested two
extensions to the unified scheme: an evolving absorption scenario, and a
luminosity dependent model distribution. Both of these provide poorer matches
to the observed X-ray colour distributions than the best fitting simple unified
model. We find that a luminosity dependent density evolution XLF reproduces
poorly the 0.5-2 keV source counts seen in the 13H field. Field to field
variations could be the cause of this disparity. Computing the simulated X-ray
colours with a simple absorbed power-law + reflection spectral model is found
to over-predict, by a factor of two, the fraction of hard sources that are
completely absorbed below 0.5 keV, implying that an additional source of
soft-band flux must be present for a number of the absorbed sources. Finally,
we show that around 40% of the 13H sample are expected to be AGN with NH>10^22
cm^-2.

in molecular clouds through radiative heating and cooling. An isothermal
equation of state is therefore frequently employed in molecular cloud
simulations. However, the dynamical processes in molecular clouds include shock
waves, expansion waves, cooling induced collapse and baroclinic vorticity, all
incompatible with the assumption of a purely isothermal flow. Here, we
incorporate an energy equation including all the important heating and cooling
rates and a simple chemical network into simulations of three-dimensional,
hydrodynamic, decaying turbulence. This allows us to test the accuracy of the
isothermal assumption by directly comparing a model run with the modified
energy equation to an isothermal model. We compute an extreme case in which the
initial turbulence is sufficiently strong to dissociate much of the gas and
alter the specific heat ratio. The molecules then reform as the turbulence
weakens. We track the true specific heat ratio as well as its effective value.
We analyse power spectra, vorticity and shock structures, and discuss scaling
laws for decaying turbulence. We derive some limitations to the isothermal
approximation for simulations of the interstellar medium using simple
projection techniques. Overall, even given the extreme conditions, we find that
an isothermal flow provides an adequate physical and observational description
of many properties. The main exceptions revealed here concern behaviour
directly related to the high temperature zones behind the shock waves.

expansion speeds roughly proportional to distance from the star (``Hubble''

distance to M 2-9. Thus, the inner ionized lobes and outer molecular lobes, as
well as the molecular torus and ``outer loops'' measured by other observers,
were all formed around the same time. Consequently, their nested structure
likely arises from an excitation gradient rather than independent ejections. H2
and [Fe II] emission is distributed more uniformly than [N II], and IR lines
are not dominated by the moving ionization pattern like visual-wavelength
lines. We suggest that this is because IR lines of [Fe II] and H2 are excited
by relatively isotropic far-UV radiation (Balmer continuum), whereas optical

sometimes been interpreted to provide steady-state relations between the energy
associated with the fluctuating magnetic field and that associated with a large
scale or mean field multiplied by a function $f$ that depends on spatial
dimension and a magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$. Here we dissect the origin of
these relations and pinpoint pitfalls that show why they are inapplicable to
realistic, dynamical MHD turbulence and that they disagree with many numerical
simulations. For 2-D, we show that when the total magnetic field is determined
by a vector potential, the standard Zeldovich relation applies only
transiently, characterizing a maximum possible value that the field energy can
reach before necessarily decaying. in relation to a seed value $Bbar$. In 3-D,
we show that the standard Zeldovich relations are derived by balancing
subdominant terms. In contrast, balancing the dominant terms shows that the
fluctuating field can grow to a value independent of $R_M$ and the initially
imposed $Bbar$, as seen in numerical simulations. We also emphasize that these
Zeldovich relations of nonhelical turbulence imply nothing about the amount
mean field growth in a helical dynamo. In short, by re-analyzing the origin of
the Zeldovich relations, we highlight that they are inapplicable to realistic

show that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, Galactic dust

quasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at >4 sigma
in all five SDSS filters. Our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scales
ranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 Mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoretical

explains the noise power above 0.01 Hz, an inner MDAF is needed to explain the
high frequency cutoff near 1 Hz, the presence of a QPO, and the production of a
jet. The MDAF scenario also is consistent with the data-based, phemonenological

networks has a tendency to move as quickly as possible to the abstract
formulation of the stochastic dynamics in terms of probabilities based on the
concept of the Chemical Master Equation (CME), largely ignoring sample path
representation.
  In this publication we discuss both theoretical basis and numerical approach
for the problems in this area using sample path methods as a crucial part of
the process. Relying as it does on a representation of the underlying
stochastic processes as a weak solution of a system of stochastic differential
equations driven by Poisson random measures this approach brings to bear a
heretofore ignored but quite effective problem solving methodology. We first
present a simple and intuitive way of partitioning species and reactions of the
interaction network into different groups. We then discuss how original
stochastic dynamics with state dependent intensities of transitions can be
reformulated in terms of jump-diffusion stochastic differential equations
driven by both Wiener noise sources and Poisson random measures. Finally, we
show that this approach facilitates the construction of hybrid simulation
techniques, an important step in the creation of efficient techniques for
modeling multi-scale stochastic dynamics of the reaction networks.
  Numerical methods related to sampling events from Poisson random measures are
demonstratedon simple intuitive examples. Error control analysis of the finite
differences scheme is also presented.

ordered lists contacts (where a contact is defined as a triple of a sender, a
recipient and a time). We propose measures of attractiveness and activity for
such data sets and analyze these quantities for anonymized contact sequences
from an Internet dating community. For this data set the attractiveness and
activity measures show broad power-law like distributions. Our attractiveness
and activity measures are more strongly correlated in the real-world data than
in our reference model. Effects that indirectly can make active users more
attractive are discussed.

non-linear phenomenon whose investigation is just at the beginning. Both
collective behaviour and personal view play an important role in this
mechanism. In the present work we mimic the dynamics of opinion formation of a
group of agents, represented by two state $\pm 1$, as a stochastic response of
each of them to the opinion of his/her neighbours in the social network and to
feedback from the average opinion of the whole. In the light of recent studies,
a scale-free Barab\'asi-Albert network has been selected to simulate the
topology of the interactions. A turbulent-like dynamics, characterized by an
intermittent behaviour, is observed for a certain range of the model
parameters. The problem of uncertainty in decision taking is also addressed
both from a topological point of view, using random and targeted removal of
agents from the network, and by implementing a three state model, where the
third state, zero, is related to the information available to each agent.
Finally, the results of the model are tested against the best known network of
social interactions: the stock market. A time series of daily closures of the
Dow Jones index has been used as an indicator of the possible applicability of
our model in the financial context. Good qualitative agreement is found.

Theory and Experiments","8 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1117/12.676869",,"physics.ins-det physics.soc-ph",,"  Multi-energy radiography is a new direction in non-destructive testing. Its
specific feature is separate detection of penetrating radiation in several
energy channels. Multi-energy radiography allows quantitative determination of
the atomic composition of objects. This is its principal advantage over
conventional radiography. In particular, dual-energy radiography allows
determination of the effective atomic number of a material with an accuracy of
up to 80-90%. Development of three-energy radiography and radiography of higher
multiplicity makes it possible to further improve the reconstruction of an
objects chemical composition. This presents the possibility, for example, of
detection of explosives and other illegal objects in luggage with a reliability
approaching 100%. These developments can find application not only in
anti-terrorist activities, but also in areas such as industrial testing and
nuclear medicine.

consider the propagation of a plane electromagnetic wave in a medium with a

the wave propagation in a homogeneous medium, we show that the reflection and
transmission of a wave at an interface between the two media is sensitive to
the difference of the axion values. This observation can be used to determine
experimentally the axion piece in matter despite the fact that a constant axion
value does not contribute to the Maxwell equations.

many-particle system is studied with a symmetry analysis. We discover that, if
the spectrum matches the symmetry of a fermion or boson system in a certain
fashion, a perfect quantum state transfer can be implemented without any
operation on the medium. Based on this observation the well-established results
for the QST via quantum spin chains can be generalized to the high-dimensional
many-particle systems with pre-engineered nearest neighbor (NN) hopping
constants. By investigating a simple but realistic near half-filled
tight-binding fermion system with uniform NN hopping integral, we show that an
arbitrary many-particle state near the fermi surface can be perfectly
transferred to its translational counterpart.
