tested in the context of dynamo theory, wherein triple correlations are assumed
to provide relaxation of the turbulent electromotive force. Under MTA, the
alpha effect in mean field dynamo theory becomes proportional to a relaxation
time scale multiplied by the difference between kinetic and current helicities.
It is shown that the value of the relaxation time is positive and, in units of
the turnover time at the forcing wavenumber, it is of the order of unity. It is
quenched by the magnetic field -- roughly independently of the magnetic
Reynolds number. However, this independence becomes uncertain at large magnetic
Reynolds number. Kinetic and current helicities are shown to be dominated by
large scale properties of the flow.

and offers a new perspective on the hierarchy problem. In the brane-world
scenario, our Universe is a four-dimensional subspace or {\em brane} embedded
in a higher-dimensional {\em bulk} spacetime. Ordinary matter fields are
confined to the brane while the gravitational field can also propagate in the
bulk, leading to modifications of Einstein's theory of general relativity at
high energies. In particular, the Randall-Sundrum-type models are
self-consistent and simple and allow for an investigation of the essential
non-linear gravitational dynamics. The governing field equations induced on the
brane differ from the general relativistic equations in that there are nonlocal
effects from the free gravitational field in the bulk, transmitted via the
projection of the bulk Weyl tensor, and the local quadratic energy-momentum
corrections, which are significant in the high-energy regime close to the
initial singularity. In this review we discuss the asymptotic dynamical
evolution of spatially homogeneous brane-world cosmological models containing
both a perfect fluid and a scalar field close to the initial singularity. Using
dynamical systems techniques it is found that, for models with a physically
relevant equation of state, an isotropic singularity is a past-attractor in all
orthogonal spatially homogeneous models (including Bianchi type IX models). In
addition, we describe the dynamics in a class of inhomogeneous brane-world
models, and show that these models also have an isotropic initial singularity.
These results provide support for the conjecture that typically the initial
cosmological singularity is isotropic in brane-world cosmology.

discontinuities in the surface brightness at the leading edge of subclusters in
merging clusters (e.g., Abell 3667), where the temperature drops sharply across
the fronts. These sharp edges are called cold fronts. We present results of
three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interaction
between a dense subcluster plasma and ambient magnetized intracluster medium.
Anisotropic heat conduction along magnetic field lines is included. At the
initial state, magnetic fields are assumed to be uniform and transverse to the
motion of the dense subcluster. Since magnetic fields ahead of the subcluster
slip toward the third direction in the 3D case, the strength of magnetic fields
in this region can be reduced compared to that in the 2D case. Nevertheless, a
cold front can be maintained because the magnetic field lines wrapping around
the forehead of the subcluster suppress the heat conduction across them. On the
other hand, when the magnetic field is absent, a cold front cannot be
maintained because isotropic heat conduction from the hot ambient plasma
rapidly heats the cold subcluster plasma.

in the surveys of Galactic plane star forming regions by Wood & Churchwell

orbifold supergravity (SUGRA). We use our off shell superfield formulation and
give a detailed description of the issue of SUSY breaking by the F-component of
the radion superfield. By a suitably gauged U(1)R symmetry and including
couplings with compensator supermultiplets and a linear multiplet, we achieve a
self consistent radion mediated SUSY breaking of no scale type. The inflaton
1-loop effective potential has attractive features needed for successful
inflation. An interesting feature of both presented inflationary scenarios are
the red tilted spectra with ns~0.96. For gauge inflation we obtain a
significant tensor to scalar ratio r~0.1 of the density perturbations, while
for the modulus inflation r is strongly suppressed.

field theories share a common universal symmetry realized as a motivic Galois
group, whose action is dictated by the divergences and generalizes that of the
renormalization group. The existence of such a group was conjectured by P.
Cartier based on number theoretic evidence and on the Connes-Kreimer theory of
perturbative renormalization. The group provides a universal formula for
counterterms and is obtained via a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence classifying
equivalence classes of flat equisingular bundles, where the equisingularity
condition corresponds to the independence of the counterterms on the mass
scale.

modified dispersion relation and short distance parameter $a$ is given by the
Lerch zeta function. The Green's function is defined on a cylinder of radius R
and we show that the condition $R = a$ yields the Riemann zeta function as a
quantum transition amplitude for the fermion. We formulate the Riemann
hypothesis physically as a nonzero condition on the transition amplitude
between two special states associated with the point of origin and a point half
way around the cylinder each of which are fixed points of a $Z_2$
transformation. By studying partial sums we show that that the transition
amplitude formulation is analogous to neutrino mixing in a low dimensional
context. We also derive the thermal partition function of the fermionic theory
and the thermal divergence at temperature $1/a.$ In an alternative harmonic
oscillator formalism we discuss the relation to the fermionic description of
two dimensional string theory and matrix models. Finally we derive various
representations of the Green's function using energy momentum integrals, point
particle path integrals, and string propagators.

and let (2A) be the set of all numbers of form a+b for each a and b in A. The
arithmetic structure of A was accurately characterized by Freiman when (i)
|2A|<3|A|-3, (ii) |2A|=3|A|-3, or (iii) |2A|=3|A|-2. It is also suggested by
Freiman that for characterizing the arithmetic structure of A when |2A|>3|A|-2,
analytic methods need to be used. However, the interesting and more general
results of Freiman, which use analytic methods, no longer give the arithmetic
structure of A as precise as the results mentioned above. In this paper we
characterize, with the help of nonstandard analysis, the arithmetic structure
of A along the same lines as Freiman's results mentioned above when
|2A|=3|A|-3+b where b is positive but not too large. Precisely, we prove that
there is a positive real number epsilon and a natural number K such that if
|A|>K and |2A|=3|A|-3+b for b between 0 and epsilon times |A|, then A is either
a subset of an arithmetic progression of length at most 2|A|-1+2b or a subset
of a bi-arithmetic progression of length at most |A|+b. The union of two
arithmetic progressions I and J of the same difference d is called a
bi-arithmetic progression if I+I, I+J, and J+J are pairwise disjoint.

$\sigma_{a.c.}$ of the operator $A_\alpha$ and its multiplicity for all values
of the parameter. The spectrum of $A_0$ is purely a.c. and admits an explicit
description. It turns out that for $\alpha<\sqrt 2$ one has
$\sigma_{a.c.}(A_\alpha)= \sigma_{a.c.}(A_0)$, including the multiplicity. For
$\alpha\ge\sqrt2$ an additional branch of absolutely continuous spectrum
arises, its source is an auxiliary Jacobi matrix which is related to the
operator $A_\alpha$. This birth of an extra-branch of a.c. spectrum is the
exact mathematical expression of the effect which was interpreted by Smilansky
as irreversibility.

investigated. Given that the frequency of the classical motion in such
potentials is energy-independent, it is natural to expect their quantum spectra
to be equispaced. However, as it has already been shown in some specific
examples, this property is not always true. To gain some general insight into
this problem, a WKB analysis of the spectrum, valid for any analytic potential,
is performed and the first semiclassical corrections to its regular spacing are
calculated. We illustrate the results on the two-parameter family of
isochronous potentials derived in [1], which includes the harmonic oscillator,
the asymmetric parabolic well, the radial harmonic oscillator and Urabe's
potential as special limiting cases. In addition, some new analytical
expressions for families of isochronous potentials and their corresponding
spectra are derived by means of the above-mentioned method.
