satellites orbiting within a Milky Way-sized halo and study for the first time
the combined effects of tides and ram pressure. The structure of the galaxy
models and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to those
expected in a LCDM Universe.While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces
objects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf
spheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely
remove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping
by diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar
formation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.
This inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.
Assuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational
constraints, dwarfs with V_{peak} < 30 km/s can be completely stripped of their
gas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with
more massive dark haloes and V_{peak} > 30 km/s lose most or all of their gas
content only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially
counteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from
the cosmic UV background at z > 2 can provide the required heating. In these
objects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter
passage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco
and Ursa Minor. The stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressure
confined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densities
comparable to the HI clouds recently discovered around M31.(abridged)

white dwarf to initial conditions during the subsonic burning phase, using 2D
simulations of the full WD. Results are presented for a wide variety of initial
flame distributions including central and off-center single point and
multi-point, simultaneous and non-simultaneous, ignitions. We also examine the
effects of convective velocity field which should exist at the core before the
thermo-nuclear runaway. Our main conclusion suggests that the amounts of
burning products and their distributions through the deflagration phase are
extremely sensitive to initial conditions, much more sensitive than presented
in previous studies. In particular, we find that more complex configurations
such as even slight off-center ignitions, non-simultaneous multi-point
ignitions and velocity fields tend to favor solutions in which individual
plumes rise faster than the bulk of a typical Rayleigh-Taylor driven, unstable
burning front. The difference to previous calculations for an octant of a WD
may be understood as a consequence of the suppression of l=1,2 modes. Our
results are consistent with full star calculations by the Chicago group.
Moreover, the total amount of nuclear burning during the phase of subsonic
burning depends sensitively on the initial conditions and may cause the WD to
pulsate or to become unbound. We discuss the implications of the results on
current models for Type Ia SNe, limitations imposed by the 2-D nature of our
study, and suggest directions for further study.

intergalactic medium in hydrostatic equilibrium within a NFW dark halo
potential in which the evolution of the halo structure between major merger
events proceeds inside-out by accretion. This model is used to explain, within
a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony, the observed X-ray properties of nearby
relaxed, non-cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies. We find that our
preferred solution to the equilibrium equations produces scaling relations in
excellent agreement with observations, while simultaneously accounting for the
typical structural characteristics of the distribution of the diffuse baryons.
In the class of preheating models, ours stands out because it offers a unified
description of the intrahalo medium for galaxy systems with total masses above
$\sm 2\times 10^{13}$\msun, does not produce baryonic configurations with large
isentropic cores, and reproduces faithfully the observed behavior of the gas
entropy at large radii. All this is achieved with a moderate level of energy
injection of about half a keV, which can be easily accommodated within the
limits of the total energy released by the most commonly invoked feedback
mechanisms, as well as with a polytropic index of 1.2, consistent with both
many observational determinations and predictions from high-resolution
gas-dynamical simulations of non-cooling flow clusters. More interestingly, our
scheme offers a physical motivation for the adoption of this specific value of
the polytropic index, as it is the one that best ensures the conservation after
halo virialization of the balance between the total specific energies of the
gas and dark matter components for the full range of masses investigated.

molecules in diffuse and dense interstellar gas clouds. The chemistry of
interstellar fluorine is qualitatively different from that of any other
element, because - unlike the neutral atoms of any other element found in
diffuse or dense molecular clouds - atomic fluorine undergoes an exothermic
reaction with molecular hydrogen. Over a wide range of conditions attained
within interstellar gas clouds, the product of that reaction - hydrogen
fluoride - is predicted to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of interstellar
fluorine nuclei. Our model predicts HF column densities ~ 1.E+13 cm-2 in dark
clouds and column densities as large as 1.E-11 cm-2 in diffuse interstellar gas
clouds with total visual extinctions as small as 0.1 mag. Such diffuse clouds
will be detectable by means of absorption line spectroscopy of the J = 1 - 0
transition at 243.2 micron using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) and the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). The CF+ ion is
predicted to be the second most abundant fluorine-bearing molecule, with
typical column densities a factor ~ 100 below those of HF; with its lowest two
rotational transitions in the millimeter-wave spectral region, CF+ may be
detectable from ground-based observatories. HF absorption in quasar spectra is
a potential probe of molecular gas at high redshift, providing a possible
bridge between the UV/optical observations capable of probing H2 in low column
density systems and the radio/millimeter-wavelength observations that probe
intervening molecular clouds of high extinction and large molecular fraction;
at redshifts beyond ~ 0.3, HF is potentially detectable from ground-based
submillimeter observatories in several atmospheric transmission windows.

statistics that expresses rotation invariance in the most natural way. This not
only offers technical advantages by reducing the integrals required for the
halo model predictions, but amounts to a convenient way of compressing the
information contained in the 3PCF. We find that, with an appropriate choice of
the halo boundary and mass function cut-off, halo model predictions are in good
agreement with the bispectrum measured in numerical simulations. However, the
halo model predicts less than the observed configuration dependence of the 3PCF
on ~ Mpc scales. This effect is mainly due to quadrupole moment deficit,
possibly related to the assumption of spherical halo geometry. Our analysis
shows that using its harmonic decomposition, the full configuration dependence
of the 3PCF in the non-linear regime can be compressed into just a few numbers,
the lowest multipoles. Moreover, these multipoles are closely related to the
highest signal to noise eigenmodes of the 3PCF. Therefore this estimator may
simplify future analyses aimed at constraining cosmological and halo model
parameters from observational data.

emission is collimated into a cone and the received flux depends on the cone

measure the ""true"" energetics of the prompt emission. Ghirlanda et al. (2004)
found that this collimation-corrected energy correlates tightly with
thefrequency at which most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted. Through
this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately enough for a
cosmological use. Using the best known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results
that emphasize the cosmological GRB role. Probing the universe with high
accuracy up to high redshifts, GRBs establish a new insight on the cosmic
expanding acceleration history and accomplish the role of ""missing link""

distinguishing characteristics of these events is the thermal (black body)
spectrum with temperatures ranging from ~50 to ~180 keV, with the highest
temperature observed for the initial 0.2 s spike of the Dec. 27th 2004 event.
We analyzed the spectra of a complete sample of short GRBs with peak fluxes
greater than 4 photon s^(-1) cm^(-2) detected by BATSE. Of the 115 short GRBs
so selected only 76 had sufficient signal to noise to allow the spectral
analysis. We find only 3 short GRBs with a spectrum well fitted by a black

a stringent limit on the rate of extragalactic SGR giant flares with spectral
properties analogous to the Dec. 27th flare. We conclude that up to 4 per cent
of the short GRBs could be associated to giant flares (2 sigma confidence).
This implies that either the distance to SGR 1806-20 is smaller than 15 kpc or
the rate of Galactic giant flares is lower than the estimated 0.033 per year.

-- 6430 A with ~ 3.1 A (FWHM) resolution. The spectroscopic observations and
data reduction were designed to integrate the full projected area within the
cluster core radii in order to properly sample the light from stars in all
relevant evolutionary stages. The S/N values of the flux-calibrated spectra
range from 50 to 240/A at 4000 A and from 125 to 500/A at 5000 A. The selected
targets span a wide range of cluster parameters, including metallicity,
horizontal-branch morphology, Galactic coordinates, Galactocentric distance,
and concentration. The total sample is thus fairly representative of the entire
Galactic globular cluster population and should be valuable for comparison with
similar integrated spectra of unresolved stellar populations in remote systems.
For most of the library clusters, our spectra can be coupled with deep
color-magnitude diagrams and reliable metal abundances from the literature to
enable the calibration of stellar population synthesis models. In this paper we
present a detailed account of the observations and data reduction. The spectral
library is publicly available in electronic format from the National Optical
Astronomical Observatory website.

discrepancies with the power spectrum predicted by the stochastic excitement
and damping theory. In an attempt to explain these discrepancies, the present
paper is concerned with the influence of the observed subsurface flows on the
trapped acoustic modes (p-modes). The effect of these inhomogeneous background
flows is investigated by means of a non-modal analysis and a multi-layer model.
It is shown that the rotational and meridional components of the velocity field
change the wavelengths of the oscillation modes which, in turn, results in
modifications of the corresponding modal frequencies. The magnitudes of the
frequency residuals depend on the spatial scales of the modes and on the
gradients of the different components of the flow velocity. Together with other
mechanisms (e.g. the scattering of modes by the large scale convection
(Goldreich & Murray 1994), the non-modal effect of the variation of the
frequencies in time may contribute: 1) to the observed widening of the
corresponding peaks in the observed power spectrum with increasing angular
degree; 2) to the partial dissipation of spectral power, and, as a result, 3)
to the discrepancies between the predicted and the observed power spectrum of
solar p-modes.

distribution was projected on the equatorial plane and we carried out a 2D
multi-fractal analysis by counting the number of galaxies inside circles of
different radii in the range 5 Mpc/h to 150 Mpc/h centred on galaxies.
Different moments of the count-in-cells were analysed to identify a range of
length-scales (60-70 Mpc/h to 150Mpc/h) where the moments show a power law
scaling behaviour and to determine the scaling exponent which gives the
spectrum of generalised dimension D_q. If the galaxy distribution is
homogeneous, D_q does not vary with q and is equal to the Euclidean dimension
which in our case is 2. We find that D_q varies in the range 1.7 to 2.2. We
also constructed mock data from random, homogeneous point distributions and
from LCDM N-body simulations with bias b=1, 1.6 and 2, and analysed these in
exactly the same way. The values of D_q in the random distribution and the
unbiased simulations show much smaller variations and these are not consistent
with the actual data. The biased simulations, however, show larger variations
in D_q and these are consistent with both the random and the actual data.
Interpreting the actual data as a realisation of a biased LCDM universe, we
conclude that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on scales larger than
60-70 Mpc/h.

nucleosynthesis (Travaglio et al. 2004) was calculated up to the homologous
phase of the explosion. Other models with different ignition conditions and
different resolution are also briefly discussed. The synthetic spectra are
compared to observed late time spectra. We find that while the model spectra
after 300 to 500 days show a good agreement with the observed Fe II-III
features, they also show too strong O I and C I lines compared to the observed
late time spectra. The oxygen and carbon emission originates from the
low-velocity unburned material in the central regions of these models. To get
agreement between the models and observations we find that only a small mass of
unburned material may be left in the center after the explosion. This may be a
problem for pure deflagration models, although improved initial conditions, as
well as higher resolution decrease the discrepancy. The relative intensity from
the different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of the
emitting iron-rich material. We find that clumping, with the presence of low
density regions, is needed to reproduce the observed iron emission, especially
in the range between 4000 and 6000 AA. Both temperature and ionization depend
sensitively on density, abundances and radioactive content. This work therefore
illustrates the importance of including the inhomogeneous nature of realistic
three-dimensional explosion models. We briefly discuss the implications of the
spectral modeling for the nature of the explosion.

color. Both the optical continuum and broad emission lines are reddened by
SMC-like dust of E(B-V)~1.0 mag, while its near-infrared color (J-Ks=1.60)

with an FWHM of 362 km/s and an equivalent width of W_{CaII K}=4.2\AA (in the

stellar origin. The ratio of column density of CaII to that of dust is
consistent with that of the ISM in our Galaxy. We suggest that both the heavy

Fourier abundances that fit the spectroscopic ones with a standard deviation of

Rossby number is much smaller and a mean-field dynamo action is more efficient.
By solving the mean-field induction equation we have computed the critical spin
period below which no dynamo action is possible and found it to be $\sim 1$ s
for a wide range of stellar models and for both axisymmetric and
non-axisymmetric magnetic fields. Because this critical period is substantially
longer than the characteristic spin period of very young pulsars, we expect

saturation dipole field estimated by making use of the model of ``global''
quenching fits well the pulsar magnetic fields inferred from the spin-down

generation of small scale fields which are typically stronger than the poloidal

an appropriate construction algorithm based on clustering the network vertices

find that the network synchronizability improves when the network becomes
disassortative, i.e. when nodes with low degree are more likely to be connected
to nodes with higher degree. We consider the case of both weighed and unweighed

set of numerical observations obtained on weighed and unweighed networks of
nonlinear R\""ossler oscillators. Using a nonlinear optimization strategy we
also show that negative degree correlation is an emerging property of networks
when synchronizability is to be optimized. This suggests that negative degree
correlation observed experimentally in a number of physical and biological
networks might be motivated by their need to synchronize better.

exchanges the degenerate states |+,-> and |-,+>. In NMR, this is achieved
turning on and off the spin-spin interaction b=\Delta E that splits the energy
levels and induces an oscillation with a natural frequency \Delta E/\hbar.
Interaction of strength \hbar/\tau_{SE}, with an environment of neighboring
spins, degrades this oscillation within a decoherence time scale \tau_{\phi}.
While the experimental frequency \omega and decoherence time \tau_{\phi} were
expected to be roughly proportional to b/\hbar and \tau_{SE} respectively, we
present here experiments that show drastic deviations in both \omega and
\tau_{\phi}. By solving the many spin dynamics, we prove that the swapping
regime is restricted to \Delta E \tau_{SE} > \hbar. Beyond a critical
interaction with the environment the swapping freezes and the decoherence rate
drops as 1/\tau_{\phi} \propto (b/\hbar)^2 \tau_{SE}. The transition between
quantum dynamical phases occurs when \omega \propto
\sqrt{(b/\hbar)^{2}-(k/\tau_{SE})^2} becomes imaginary, resembling an
overdamped classical oscillator. Here, 0<k^2<1 depends only on the anisotropy
of the system-environment interaction, being 0 for isotropic and 1 for XY
interactions. This critical onset of a phase dominated by the Quantum Zeno
effect opens up new opportunities for controlling quantum dynamics.

and 0.6). The Cr$^{3+}$ substitution for Mn$^{3+}$ sites causes a removal of
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital of $e_g$-electron resulting in a volume shrinkage of
lattice. Magnetic measurements reveal the appearance of a glassy behavior for
Cr-doped samples, accompanied by both a collapse of the A-type
antiferromagnetic structure and the growth of ferromagnetic clusters. Cr-doping
effect on electrical transport strongly enhances an insulating behavior over a
wide range of temperature, while it suppresses a local minimum of
thermoelectric power at lower temperatures. The phonon thermal conduction
gradually rises with increasing Cr content, which is contradictory to a typical
impurity effect on thermal conductivity. We attribute this to a suppression of
local lattice distortion through the introduction of Jahn-Teller inactive ions
of Cr$^{3+}$.

  The aim of this paper is to survey the recent work in medical documents
summarization.
  Background:
  During the last decade, documents summarization got increasing attention by
the AI research community. More recently it also attracted the interest of the
medical research community as well, due to the enormous growth of information
that is available to the physicians and researchers in medicine, through the
large and growing number of published journals, conference proceedings, medical
sites and portals on the World Wide Web, electronic medical records, etc.
  Methodology:
  This survey gives first a general background on documents summarization,
presenting the factors that summarization depends upon, discussing evaluation
issues and describing briefly the various types of summarization techniques. It
then examines the characteristics of the medical domain through the different
types of medical documents. Finally, it presents and discusses the
summarization techniques used so far in the medical domain, referring to the
corresponding systems and their characteristics.
  Discussion and conclusions:
  The paper discusses thoroughly the promising paths for future research in
medical documents summarization. It mainly focuses on the issue of scaling to
large collections of documents in various languages and from different media,
on personalization issues, on portability to new sub-domains, and on the
integration of summarization technology in practical applications

deciding for a given graph, between the case where one can 3-color all but a

or electromagnetic zero-point field, makes a contribution to the inertial
reaction force on an accelerated object. We show that the result for inertial
mass can be extended to passive gravitational mass. As a consequence the weak
equivalence principle, which equates inertial to passive gravitational mass,
appears to be explainable. This in turn leads to a straightforward derivation
of the classical Newtonian gravitational force. We call the inertia and
gravitation connection with the vacuum fields the quantum vacuum inertia
hypothesis. To date only the electromagnetic field has been considered. It
remains to extend the hypothesis to the effects of the vacuum fields of the
other interactions. We propose an idealized experiment involving a cavity
resonator which, in principle, would test the hypothesis for the simple case in
which only electromagnetic interactions are involved. This test also suggests a
basis for the free parameter $\eta(\nu)$ which we have previously defined to
parametrize the interaction between charge and the electromagnetic zero-point
field contributing to the inertial mass of a particle or object.

in the observable sector can be much larger than the TeV scale. Depending on
the relation between the masses, new important channels for gravitino
production in the early Universe can arise. Gravitinos with a mass above 50 TeV
decay before big bang nucleosynthesis, which leads to relaxation of the well
known bound on the reheating temperature $T_{\rm R} \leq 10^{10}$ GeV. However,
if the heavy gravitinos are produced abundantly in the early Universe, their
decay can alter the abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle.
Moreover, they may dominate the energy density of the Universe. Their decay
will in this case increase entropy and dilute already created baryon asymmetry
and dark matter. Such considerations put new constraints on gravitino and
sfermion masses, and the reheating temperature. In this paper we examine
various cosmological consequences of supermassive gravitinos. We discuss
advnatges and disadvantages of a large reheating temperature in connection with
thermal leptogenesis, and find that large parts of the parameter space are
opened up for the lightest right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We also discuss the

manifold with the curvature $k=1,~0$ and -1. We also assume $4{\tilde

sourceless solution (M=0) to be defined. The general solutions are classified
into plus and minus branches. The structures of the center, horizons, infinity
and the singular point depend on the parameters $\alpha$, $\ell^2$, $k$, $M$
and branches complicatedly so that a variety of global structures for the

asymptotic structure at infinity as that in general relativity with a negative
cosmological constant. For the negative mass parameter, a new type of
singularity called the branch singularity appears at non-zero finite radius
$r=r_b>0$. The divergent behavior around the singularity in Gauss-Bonnet
gravity is milder than that around the central singularity in general
relativity. In the $k=1,~0$ cases the plus-branch solutions do not have any
horizon. In the $k=-1$ case, the radius of the horizon is restricted as

described as a single point particle moving in a high-dimensional space with
fixed hypercylindrical scatterers with specific orientations and positions. In
this paper, the similarities in the Lyapunov exponents are investigated between
systems of many particles and high-dimensional billiards with cylindrical
scatterers which have isotropically distributed orientations and homogeneously
distributed positions. The dynamics of the isotropic billiard are calculated
using a Monte-Carlo simulation, and a reorthogonalization process is used to
find the Lyapunov exponents. The results are compared to numerical results for
systems of many hard particles as well as the analytical results for the
high-dimensional Lorentz gas. The smallest three-quarters of the positive
exponents behave more like the exponents of hard-disk systems than the
exponents of the Lorentz gas. This similarity shows that the hard-disk systems
may be approximated by a spatially homogeneous and isotropic system of
scatterers for a calculation of the smaller Lyapunov exponents, apart from the
exponent associated with localization. The method of the partial stretching
factor is used to calculate these exponents analytically, with results that
compare well with simulation results of hard disks and hard spheres.

varying the momentum cutoff of a two-nucleon potential. Conventional force
models, which have large cutoffs, are nonperturbative because of strong
short-range repulsion, the iterated tensor interaction, and the presence of
bound or nearly-bound states. But for low-momentum interactions with cutoffs
around 2 fm^{-1}, the softened potential combined with Pauli blocking leads to
corrections in nuclear matter in the particle-particle channel that are well
converged at second order in the potential, suggesting that perturbation theory
can be used in place of Brueckner resummations. Calculations of nuclear matter
using the low-momentum two-nucleon force V_{low k} with a corresponding
leading-order three-nucleon (3N) force from chiral effective field theory (EFT)
exhibit nuclear binding in the Hartree-Fock approximation, and become less
cutoff dependent with the inclusion of the dominant second-order contributions.
The role of the 3N force is essential to obtain saturation, and the
contribution to the total potential energy is compatible with EFT
power-counting estimates.

propose a modified model: when a scientist writes a manuscript, he picks up

the model using methods of the theory of branching processes, and find that it

Airy wave theory. This equation is shown to be generally inconsistent due to
inadequate approximations of the wave motion. Indeed the evaluation of the
vertical flux of momentum requires an estimation of the pressure $p$ and
coordinate transformation function $s$ to first order in parameters that define
the large scale evolution of the wave field, such as the bottom slope.
Unfortunately there is no analytical expression for $p$ and $s$ at that order.
A numerical correction method is thus proposed and verified. Alternative
coordinate transforms that allow a separation of wave and mean flow momenta do
not suffer from this inconsistency nor require a numerical estimation of the
wave forcing. Indeed, the problematic vertical flux is part of the wave
momentum flux, thus distinct from the mean flow momentum flux, and not directly
relevant to the mean flow evolution.

Hubbell[2] generalized this neutral theory to explore the expected steady-state
distribution of relative species abundance (RSA) in the local community under
restricted immigration. Here we present a theoretical framework for the unified
neutral theory of biodiversity[2] and an analytical solution for the
distribution of the RSA both in the metacommunity (Fisher's logseries) and in
the local community, where there are fewer rare species. Rare species are more
extinction-prone, and once they go locally extinct, they take longer to
re-immigrate than do common species. Contrary to recent assertions[3], we show
that the analytical solution provides a better fit, with fewer free parameters,
to the RSA distribution of tree species on Barro Colorado Island (BCI)[4] than

cosine-sine matrix decomposition was applied to efficiently implement
decompositions of general quantum gates. In this chapter, we review the
different types of general gate decompositions and slightly improve the best
known gate count for the controlled NOT gates to (23/48)4^n in the leading
