of the Trapezium Cluster with Gemini South/Flamingos. 396 sources were detected
in a 26 arcmin^2 area, including 138 brown dwarf candidates, defined as M<0.075
Msun for an assumed age of 1 Myr. Only 33 of the brown dwarf candidates are
planetary mass candidates (PMCs) with estimated masses in the range
0.003<M<0.012Msun. In an extinction limited sample (A(V)<5) complete to
approximately 0.005 Msun (5 Mjup) the mass function appears to drop by a factor
of 2 at the deuterium burning threshold, i.e. at planetary masses. After
allowing for background contamination it is likely that planetary mass objects
at 3-13 Mjup number <10% of the cluster population, with an upper limit of 13%.
Analysis of the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarf candidates
suggests that brown dwarfs and very low mass stars (M<0.1 Msun) are less likely
than more massive stars to have wide (>150 AU) binary companions. This result
has modest statistical significance (96%) in our data but is supported at 93%
confidence by analysis of an completely independent sample taken from the
Subaru data of Kaifu et al.(2000). There is a statistically very significant
excess of both stars and brown dwarfs with small separations from each other
(<6 arcsec or 2600 AU). This appears to be due to the presence of small N
subgroups, which are likely to be dynamically unstable in the long term. Hence
these results are consistent with the 'ejected stellar embryo' hypothesis for
brown dwarf formation (Reipurth & Clarke 2001). We also report the discovery of
two new bipolar nebulae, which are interpreted as Class I protostars.

between the traditionally-used first harmonic amplitude and the true, physical

the amplitude and angular reconstruction powers of the Pierre Auger

an efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. In two

increases with projected distance from the cluster center. We also find that
the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxy
surface density in the same two clusters. We compare the median rate of star
formation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-forming
field galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster SFRs are

the Mt. Laguna Observatory 1m telescope, and six Stromgren b+y transits
observed between 2001-2004 with two of the Automatic Photometric Telescopes at
Fairborn Observatory. The radial velocities were derived from Keck/HIRES
observations. The model properly treats the orbital dynamics of the system, and
thus yields robust and physically self-consistent solutions. Our set of system
parameters agrees with previously published results though with improved
accuracy. For example, applying robust limits on the stellar mass of
0.93-1.20Msun, we find 1.26 < Rplanet < 1.42 Rjup and 0.59 < Mplanet < 0.70
Mjup. We can reduce the uncertainty on these estimates by including a stellar
mass-radius relation constraint, yielding Rplanet = 1.35 +/- 0.07 Rjup and
Mplanet = 0.66 +/- 0.04 Mjup. Our results verify that the planetary radius is
10-20% larger than predicted by planet evolution models, confirming the need
for an additional mechanism to slow the evolutionary contraction of the planet.

shallower than most previous studies, with intrinsic scatter of 0.13 dex and
0.16 dex. Our direct estimates of the total-to-stellar mass ratio within

typical ratio of the rotation speed predicted for the stellar disk alone to the
observed rotation speed at 2.2R_d is ~0.65. The distribution of R_d at fixed
M_* is broad, but we find no correlation between disk size and the residual
from the M_*-V_2.2 relation, implying that this relation is an approximately
edge-on view of the disk galaxy fundamental plane. Independent of the assumed
IMF, this result implies that stellar disks do not, on average, dominate the
mass within 2.2R_d. We discuss our results in the context of infall models of
disk formation in cold dark matter halos. A model with a disk-to-halo mass
ratio m_d=0.05 provides a reasonable match to the R_d-M_* distribution for spin
parameters \lambda ranging from ~0.04-0.08, and it yields a reasonable match to
the mean M_*-V_2.2 relation. A model with m_d=0.1 predicts overly strong
correlations between disk size and M_*-V_2.2 residual. Explaining the wide

is coincident with a known radio source. The radio spectral index of this
source is consistent with particle acceleration in shocks, leading us to
suggest that it is a non-radiative SNR. We have also found new optical

spectroscopy, the identification of these two optical counterparts increases
the total number of known optically emitting SNRs in M33 to 100. This brings
the total number of identified SNRs with X-ray counterparts, including those

remaining 1% using optical telescopes. Many of the 1-D and 2-D speeds
(referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the

somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent
electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1-D speeds for
the normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6) km/s respectively. The
corresponding mean 2-D speeds are 246(22) and 87(13) km/s. PSRs B2011+38 and

speeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with
previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73
pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3 Myr, we find the mean 3-D pulsar
birth velocity to be 400(40) km/s. The distribution of velocities is well
described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1-D rms sigma=265 km/s. There is no
evidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. The proper motions for PSRs

and dense young clusters show that encounters between disc-surrounded stars are
relatively common events which should significantly influence the resulting
disc structure. In turn this should alter the accretion rate of disc matter
onto the star and the conditions under which planet formation occurs. Although
the effects of star-disc encounters have been previously investigated, very
little is known about encounters where both stars are surrounded by discs. In
this paper encounters of such disc-disc systems are studied quantitatively. It
is found that for low-mass discs ($M_D$= 0.01 $M_\sun$) the results from
star-disc encounters can be straightforwardly generalized to disc-disc
encounters as long as there is no mass transport between the discs. Differences
to star-disc encounters occur naturally where significant amounts of matter are
transported between the discs. In this case it is found that although the mass
distribution does not change significantly, matter caught onto highly eccentric
orbits is transported surprisingly far inside the disc. The captured mass
partly replenishes the disc, but has a much lower angular momentum. This can
lead to a reduction of the angular momentum in the entire disc and thus
considerably increased accretion shortly after the encounter as well as in the
long term.

campaign of the counterpart of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 000911, located at
redshift z=1.06, from 5 days to more than 13 months after explosion. Our
extensive dataset is a factor of 2 larger and spans a time interval about 4
times longer than the ones considered previously for this GRB afterglow; this
allows a more thorough analysis of its light curve and of the GRB host galaxy
properties. The afterglow light curves show a single power-law temporal
decline, modified at late times by light from a host galaxy with moderate
intrinsic extinction, and possibly by an emerging supernova (SN). The afterglow
evolution is interpreted within the classical ""fireball"" scenario as a weakly
collimated adiabatic shock propagating in the interstellar medium. The presence
of a SN light curve superimposed on the non-thermal afterglow emission is
investigated: while in the optical bands no significant contribution to the
total light is found from a SN, the NIR J-band data show an excess which is
consistent with a SN as bright as the known hypernova SN1998bw. If the SN
interpretation is true, this would be the farthest GRB-associated SN, as well
as the farthest core-collapse SN, discovered to date. However, other possible
explanations of this NIR excess are also investigated. Finally, we studied the
photometric properties of the host, and found that it is likely to be a
slightly reddened, subluminous, extreme starburst compact galaxy, with
luminosity about 0.1 L*, an age of about 0.5 Gyr and a specific Star Formation
Rate (SFR) of approximately 30 Msol yr-1 (L/L*)-1. This is the highest specific
SFR value for a GRB host inferred from optical/NIR data.

galaxies are analysed and shown to agree well with observations of disky, fast
rotating elliptical galaxies. This supports the major merger hypothesis of
early-type galaxy formation. However, in contrast to previous claims, the
merger remnants are very anisotropic with values of the anisotropy parameter
that are similar to equal-mass merger remnants that form boxy, slowly rotating
ellipticals. Including gas in the simulations does not change this result
although the line-of-sight velocity profile and the intrinsic orbital structure
are strongly affected by the presenceof gas. The kinematical difference between
boxy and disky ellipticals appears not to be the amount of anisotropy but
rather rotation and the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor. The apparent
isotropy of observed disky ellipticals is shown to result from inclination
effects. Even small inclination angles strongly reduce the measured anisotropy
of fast rotating systems, seen in projection. A second problem is the limited
amount of information that is available when measuring only the central
velocity dispersion and a characteristic rotation and ellipticity. Methods are
investigated that allow a better determination of the intrinsic anisotropy of
fast rotating early-type galaxies with known inclination angles.

a mild, but significant, enrichment ([s/Fe] ~ +0.5) of heavy elements for which
the distribution points to slow neutron capture nucleosynthesis. This result is
strengthened by a comparative analysis to the non-enriched RV Tauri star DS Aqr
([s/Fe] = 0.0). Although V453 Oph is the first RV Tauri star showing a strong
s-process signature, it is NOT accompanied by C enhancement, challenging our
current nucleosynthetic models of post-AGB stars that predict a simultaneous
enrichment in C and s-process elements. The low N abundance excludes CN cycling
as being responsible for the low C abundance. We explore three different
scenarios to explain the heavy element distribution in this evolved object: an
enrichment of the parental cloud, an accretion scenario in which the chemical
patterns were acquired by mass transfer in a binary system and an intrinsic
enrichment by dredge-up.

metals. In the third part, we address special cases such as strained solids,
the defreezing of glass surfaces, and rotational surface melting. Next, we
digress briefly to surface layering of a liquid metal, possibly leading to
solid-like or hexatic two dimensional phases floating on the liquid. In the

of the surface through radial deformation, nor by the coadsorption of Li atom
that makes the semiconducting tube metallic. Though the bonding is strengthened
upon adsorption directly to Li atom, yet its nature continues to be
physisorption. However, the character of the bonding changes dramatically when
SWNT is functionalized by the adsorption of Pt atom. Single H$_{2}$ is
chemisorbed to Pt atom on the SWNT either dissociatively or molecularly. If
Pt-SWNT bond is weakened either by displacing Pt from bridge site to a specific
position or by increasing number of the adsorbed H$_{2}$, the dissociative
adsorption of H$_{2}$ is favored. For example, out of two adsorbed H$_{2}$,
first one can be adsorbed dissociatively, second one is chemisorbed
molecularly. The nature of bonding is weak physisorption for the third adsorbed
H$_{2}$. Palladium also promotes the chemisorption of H$_{2}$ with relatively
smaller binding energy. Present results reveal the important effect of
transition metal atom adsorbed on SWNT and advance our understanding of the

ferromagnetic films. The analysis of the constraint as a function of the axis
deviation angle, the domain aspect ratio and the damping parameter allows the
conditions to be found for maximal microwave permeability. The results obtained
may be useful in connection with the problem of developing high-permeable
microwave magnetic materials.

We employ a coarse-grained phase field model with local conservation of
density, which has been developed earlier for spontaneous imbibition driven by
a capillary forces. The forced flow creates interfaces that propagate at a
constant average velocity. We first derive a linearized equation of motion for
the interface fluctuations using projection methods. From this we extract a
time-independent crossover length $\xi_\times$, which separates two regimes of
dissipative behavior and governs the kinetic roughening of the interfaces by
giving an upper cutoff for the extent of the fluctuations. By numerically
integrating the phase field model, we find that the interfaces are superrough
with a roughness exponent of $\chi = 1.35 \pm 0.05$, a growth exponent of
$\beta = 0.50 \pm 0.02$, and $\xi_\times \sim v^{-1/2}$ as a function of the
velocity. These results are in good agreement with recent experiments on
Hele-Shaw cells. We also make a direct numerical comparison between the
solutions of the full phase field model and the corresponding linearized
interface equation. Good agreement is found in spatial correlations, while the
temporal correlations in the two models are somewhat different.

suffer from fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking. Supersymmetry is
dynamically broken at a scale \Lambda \approx (10 - 100) TeV, which is
transmitted to the supersymmetric standard model sector through standard model
gauge interactions. The dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector possesses an
approximate global SU(5) symmetry, whose SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) subgroup is
explicitly gauged and identified as the standard model gauge group. This SU(5)
symmetry is dynamically broken at the scale \Lambda, leading to
pseudo-Goldstone boson states, which we call xyons. We perform a detailed
estimate for the xyon mass and find that it is naturally in the multi-TeV
region. We study general properties of xyons, including their lifetime, and
study their collider signatures. A generic signature is highly ionizing tracks
caused by stable charged bound states of xyons, which may be observed at the
LHC. We also consider cosmology in our scenario and find that a consistent
picture can be obtained. Our framework is general and does not depend on the
detailed structure of the Higgs sector, nor on the mechanism of gaugino mass
generation.

existence of {\it additional} Dirac bispinor indices decoupled from the

derive four classes of integrable equations of heavenly type, generalizing the

  J. Math",,,,"math.RT math.CO",,"  Cartan matrices are of fundamental importance in representation theory. For
algebras defined by quivers (i.e. directed graphs) with relations the
computation of the entries of the Cartan matrix amounts to counting nonzero
paths in the quivers, leading naturally to a combinatorial setting. In this
paper we study a refined version, so-called q-Cartan matrices, where each
nonzero path is weighted by a power of an indeterminant q according to its
length. Specializing q=1 gives the classical Cartan matrix. Our main motivation
are derived module categories and their invariants: the invariant factors, and
hence the determinant, of the Cartan matrix are preserved by derived
equivalences. The paper deals with the important class of (skewed-) gentle
algebras which occur naturally in representation theory, especially in the
context of derived categories. These algebras are defined in purely
combinatorial terms. We determine normal forms for the Cartan matrices of
(skewed-) gentle algebras. In particular, we give explicit combinatorial
formulae for the invariant factors and thus also for the determinant of the
Cartan matrices of skewed-gentle algebras. As an application of our main
results we show how one can use our formulae for the notoriously difficult
problem of distinguishing derived equivalence classes.

way that this class of compact operators, used in the definition of the class

Fredholm operator which may not admit an adjoint one has a decomposition into a
direct sum of an isomorphism and a finitely generated operator. In the space of
compact operators in the Hilbert space a new IM-topology is defined. In the
case when the $C^{*}$--algebra is a commutative algebra of continuous functions

The first characterization is obtained by associating certain bitableaux with
the graphs. We order these bitableaux by suitably defined lexicographic order
and denote the bitableau that is least in this order as the standard
representation for the associated graph. The standard representation
characterizes graphs uniquely. The second characterization is obtained in terms
of associated rooted, unordered, pseudo trees. We show that the isomorphism of
two given graphs is implied by the isomorphism of their associated pseudo
trees. The third characterization is obtained in terms of ordered adjacency
lists to be associated with two given labeled graphs. We show the two given
labeled graphs are isomorphic if and only if their associated ordered adjacency
lists can be made identical by the action of suitable transpositions on any one

for parameters corresponding to water as a working fluid, we perform full
numerical stability analyses of hexagons in the strongly nonlinear regime

the hexagons, i.e. as $\epsilon$ is increased they can lose and {\it regain}
stability. This can occur for values of $\epsilon$ as low as $\epsilon=0.2$. We
identify two factors contributing to the reentrance: i) the hexagons can make
contact with a hexagon attractor that has been identified recently in the
nonlinear regime even in Boussinesq convection (Assenheimer & Steinberg (1996);
Clever & Busse (1996)) and ii) the non-Boussinesq effects increase with

reentrant hexagons can prevail even for side-wall conditions that favor
convection in the form of the competing stable rolls. For sufficiently strong

elucidates that in-phase synchronization of IF neurons occurs with only
inhibitory synapses. Then, we investigate entrainment of two clusters of IF

show the low entrainment capability, which is explained by a pitchfork

of traffic a similar problem? In order to address this question, we present
experimental results on humans playing a route choice game in a computer
laboratory, which allow one to study decision behavior in repeated games beyond
the Prisoner's Dilemma. We will focus on whether individuals manage to find a
cooperative and fair solution compatible with the system-optimal road usage. We
find that individuals tend towards a user equilibrium with equal travel times
in the beginning. However, after many iterations, they often establish a
coherent oscillatory behavior, as taking turns performs better than applying
pure or mixed strategies. The resulting behavior is fair and compatible with
system-optimal road usage. In spite of the complex dynamics leading to
coordinated oscillations, we have identified mathematical relationships
quantifying the observed transition process. Our main experimental discoveries
for 2- and 4-person games can be explained with a novel reinforcement learning
model for an arbitrary number of persons, which is based on past experience and
trial-and-error behavior. Gains in the average payoff seem to be an important
driving force for the innovation of time-dependent response patterns, i.e. the

performance of fluid transportation in the devices. Therefore, the
determination of flow state which is laminar flow or turbulent flow is an
important task to predict the performance of the flow devices. In previous
works, we have proposed an energy gradient method for studying the flow
instability and turbulent transition. In this method, it is shown that the flow
instability and turbulent transition in wall bounded shear flows depend on the
relative magnitude of the gradient of the total mechanical energy in transverse
direction and the rate of loss of the total mechanical energy along the
streamwise direction for a given imposed disturbance. For pipe and plane
Poiseuille flows, it has been demonstrated that the transition to turbulence
for these wall bounded parallel flows occurs at a consistent value of the
energy gradient parameter (Kmax). In present study, the critical condition for
turbulent transition in annulus flow is calculated with the energy gradient
method for various radius ratios. The critical flow rate and critical Reynolds
number are given for various radius ratios. Then, the analytical results are
compared with the experiments in the literature. Finally, the implication of

of the classical path integral of Gozzi et al.. It is shown how the key element
of this procedure - the loss of information constraint - can be implemented by
means of Faddeev-Jackiw's treatment of constrained systems. It is argued that
the emergent quantum systems are identical with systems obtained in [Phys.Rev.
A 71 (2005) 052507] through Dirac-Bergmann's analysis. We illustrate our
approach with two simple examples - free particle and linear harmonic
oscillator. Potential Liouville anomalies are shown to be absent.

quantum states. The unknown states are provided as inputs, or programs, for the
program registers and a third system, which is guaranteed to be prepared in one
of the states stored in the program registers, is fed into the data register of
the device. The device will then, with some probability of success, tell us
whether the unknown state in the data register matches the state stored in the
first or the second program register. We show that the optimal device, i. e.
the one that maximizes the probability of success, is universal. It does not
depend on the actual unknown states that we wish to discriminate.

charge qubits. It is shown that by using shaped pulses a CNOT gate can be
obtained with a trace fidelity > 0.99999 for the two qubits, and even when
including higher charge states, the leakage is below 1%. Yet, the required time
is only a fifth of the pioneering experiment [T. Yamamoto et al., Nature 425
(2003), 941] for otherwise identical parameters. The controls have palindromic
smooth time courses representable by superpositions of a few harmonics. We
outline schemes to generate these shaped pulses such as simple network
synthesis. The approach is easy to generalise to larger systems as shown by a
fast realisation of TOFFOLI's gate in three linearly coupled charge qubits.
Thus it is to be anticipated that this method will find wide application in
coherent quantum control of systems with finite degrees of freedom whose
dynamics are Lie-algebraically closed.

to a certain maximally entangled state?'' using LOCC, in the context of
hypothesis testing. Under several locality and invariance conditions, optimal
tests will be derived for several special cases by using basic theory of group
representations. Some optimal tests are realized by performing quantum
teleportation and checking whether the state is teleported. We will also give a
finite process for realizing some optimal tests. The performance of the tests
will be numerically compared.
