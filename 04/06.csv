that decoupled early in the history of the universe and cooled adiabatically to
an extremely low temperature. Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon
scales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their
small scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized
cut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at
the thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing
to the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation
field. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at
thermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of
\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.
The suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic
oscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although
the two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a
particle mass of M~100GeV. The initial conditions for recent numerical
simulations of the earliest and smallest objects to have formed in the
universe, need to be modified accordingly. The smallest dark matter clumps may
be detectable through gamma-ray production from particle annihilation, through
fluctuations in the event rate of direct detection experiments, or through
their tidal gravitational effect on wide orbits of objects near the outer edge

effect, such that the number of planets with radius R_p detected in a
signal-to-noise ratio limited transit survey is proportional to R_p^alpha, with
alpha~4-6. In the presence of a dispersion sigma in the intrinsic distribution
of planet radii, this selection effect translates to bias b in the radii of
observed planets. Detected planets are, on average, larger by a fractional
amount b ~ alpha (sigma/<R_p>)^2 relative to the mean radius <R_p> of the
underlying distribution. I argue that the intrinsic dispersion in planetary
radii is likely to be in the range sigma = (0.05-0.13)R_J, where the lower
bound is that expected theoretically solely from the variance in stellar
insolation, and the upper bound is the 95% c.l. upper limit from the scatter in

compensate each other. By comparing VPF's for samples with fixed galaxy mass

The final set comprises 249 galaxies with a median redshift z=0.7. The
distribution of number counts versus apparent magnitude suggests a substantial
decrease of the comoving number density with redshift. The majority of the
galaxies feature passively evolving old stellar populations. One third of those
in the upper half of the redshift distribution have blue colors, in contrast to
only 10% in the lower redshift subsample. An adaptive binning of the color maps
is performed to explore the internal color distribution. We find that most blue
galaxies in our sample feature blue cores whereas most of the red early-types
are passively evolving stellar populations with red cores. The color gradients
and scatter do not evolve with redshift and are compatible with the
observations at z=0 assuming a radial dependence of the metallicity within each
galaxy. This work emphasizes the need for a careful sample selection, as we
found that most of those galaxies which were visually classified as early types

  Electronic Conference Proceedings Archive, 2005, in prep",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The three X-ray states of active accretion in black-hole binaries have been
re-defined to focus attention on different physical elements that may
contribute radiation: the accretion disk, a jet, and a compact and radio-quiet
corona. Examples of state evolution are displayed on a time line, and on a
hardness-intensity diagram. The latter format allows a synthesis of these
states with the ``unified model for black hole binary jets'' by Fender,
Belloni, & Gallo (2004). As suggested by Corbel (2004), the ``jet line''
appears to coincide with the hard limit of the SPL state. In GX339-4, the broad
power peaks in the PDS are confined to intermediate and hard states, where a
jet is present. This suggests that these Fourier components are temporal
signatures of non-thermal processes related to the jet mechanism, rather than
properties inherent to a standard accretion disk.

concentrations of Fe++ and Fe3+ in ionized nebulae. We calculate a set of
photoionization models, updated with the atomic data relevant to the problem,
and compare their results with those derived for the available nebulae where
both [Fe III] and [Fe IV] lines have been measured. Our new model results are
closer to the measured values than the results of previous calculations, but a
discrepancy remains. This discrepancy translates into an uncertainty in the
derived Fe abundances of a factor up to ~4. We explore the possible causes of
this discrepancy and find that errors in the Fe atomic data may be the most
likely explanation. The discrepancy can be fully accounted for by any of the
following changes: (1) an increase by a factor of ~10 in the recombination rate
(radiative plus dielectronic, or charge transfer) for Fe3+, (2) an increase by
a factor of 2-3 in the effective collision strengths for Fe++, or (3) a
decrease by a factor of 2-3 in the effective collision strengths for Fe3+. We
derive the Fe abundances implied by these three explanations and use the
results to constrain the degree of depletion of Fe in our sample nebulae. The
Galactic H II regions and planetary nebulae are found to have high depletion
factors, with less than 5% of their Fe atoms in the gas phase. The
extragalactic H II regions (LMC 30 Doradus, SMC N88A, and SBS 0335-052) have
somewhat lower depletions. The metal-deficient blue compact galaxy SBS 0335-052

amplification mechanism to overcome this. The dark energy is taken to be a
complex scalar field, where the radial field has a Mexican hat potential.
During inflation, the radial component is trapped near the maximum of its
potential. At the end of inflation, it rolls down to the minimum. The dark
energy today is taken to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. The perturbations
generated during inflation are amplified by the rolling of the radial field. We
also examine the use of the variable decay mechanism in order to generate an
anti-correlation between the dark energy perturbations and the curvature
perturbation. We show that using this mechanism then constrains the properties
of the dark energy and its evolution from redshift one until today.

The canonical scale height of the disk population has been taken to be 90 pc
for most studies of the nature of this confusion-limited signal. This estimate
is probably too low, and the consequences of a more realistic scale height are
investigated with a model of the LISA signal due to populations of close white
dwarf binaries with different scale heights. If the local space density of
CWDBs is held constant, increasing the scale height results in both an increase
in the overall strength of the confusion-limited signal as well as in increase
in the frequency at which the signals become individually resolvable. If the
total number of binaries is held constant, increasing the scale height results
in a reduction of the number of expected bright signals above the
confusion-limited signal at low frequencies. We introduce an estimator for
comparing this transition frequency that takes into account the signal
spreading at higher frequencies.

z=0.89. Previous X-ray observations attribute the observed absorption at E<2
keV to the lensing galaxy. Our analysis, although not in contrast with this
hypothesis, suggests also the possibility of an intrinsic (ionized) absorption,
taking place at the front side of the jet. This scenario is also supported by
some evidence, in the same data, of a feature observed at 2.15 keV which can be
interpreted as a blueshifted iron line (v/c ~ 0.18). The SED of PKS1830-211 can
be well modelled by combining a Synchrotron Self-Compton component and an
external source of photons to be scattered up to \gamma-ray energies by
relativistic electrons moving outward in the jet. The main source of low energy
photons is a dust torus at the temperature of 10^3 K as expected in MeV

radiative transfer problems. The sampling of the radiation field and
convergence of dust temperature calculations in the case of optically thick
clouds are both studied. For spherically symmetric clouds we find that the
computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations can be reduced, in some cases by
orders of magnitude, with simple importance weighting schemes. This is
particularly true for models consisting of cells of different sizes for which
the run times would otherwise be determined by the size of the smallest cell.
We present a new idea of extending importance weighting to scattered photons.
This is found to be useful in calculations of scattered flux and could be
important for three-dimensional models when observed intensity is needed only
for one general direction of observations. Convergence of dust temperature
calculations is studied for models with optical depths 10-10000. We examine
acceleration methods where radiative interactions inside a cell or between
neighbouring cells are treated explicitly. In optically thick clouds with
strong self-coupling between dust temperatures the run times can be reduced by
more than one order of magnitude. The use of a reference field was also
examined. This eliminates the need for repeating simulation of constant sources
(e.g., background radiation) after the first iteration and significantly
reduces sampling errors. The applicability of the methods for three-dimensional

belonging to several present day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD
populations have apparently been modified by destructive tidal forces in the
inner Galaxy. We estimate that the present population of Galactic natives may
only represent some two-thirds of the original population. Several low SB
clusters are highly flattened. We briefly speculate that this ellipticity may
represent the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-halos in which such

AT Microscopii and EQ Pegasi. The light curves reveal frequent flaring during
all four observations. We perform a uniform spectral analysis and determine
plasma temperatures, abundances and emission measures in different states of
activity. Applying multi-temperature models with variable abundances separately
to data obtained with the EPIC and RGS detectors we are able to investigate the
consistency of the results obtained by the different instruments onboard
XMM-Newton. We find that the X-ray properties of the sample M dwarfs are very
similar, with the coronal abundances of all sample stars following a trend of
increasing abundance with increasing first ionization potential, the inverse
FIP effect. The overall metallicities are below solar photospheric ones but
appear consistent with the measured photospheric abundances of M dwarfs like
these. A significant increase in the prominence of the hotter plasma components
is observed during flares while the cool plasma component is only marginally
affected by flaring, pointing to different coronal structures. AT Mic, probably
a young pre-main-sequence system, has the highest X-ray luminosity and exhibits
also the hottest corona. While results of EQ Peg and EV Lac are presented here
for the first time, AT Mic and AD Leo have been investigated before with
different analysis approaches, allowing a comparison of the results.

shortest known orbital period. The source shows an 100% X-ray intensity
modulation at the putative orbital frequency of 3.11 mHz (321.5 s). If the
system is a detached, ultracompact binary gravitational radiation should drive
spin-up with a magnitude of ~10-16 Hz/s. Here we describe the results of the
first phase coherent X-ray monitoring campaign on RX J0806.3+1527 with Chandra.
We obtained a total of 70 ksec of exposure in 6 epochs logarithmically spaced
over 320 days. These data conclusively show that the X-ray frequency is
increasing at a rate of 3.77 +- 0.8 x 10-16 Hz/s. Using our new ephemeris we
are able to phase up all the earlier Chandra and ROSAT data and show they are
consistent with a rate of 3.63 +- 0.06 x 10-16 Hz/s over the past decade. This
value appears consistent with that recently derived by Israel et al. largely
from monitoring of the optical modulation, and is in rough agreement with the
solutions reported initially by Hakala et al., based on ground-based optical
observations. The large spin-up is consistent with gravitational radiation
losses driving the evolution. An intermediate polar (IP) scenario where the
observed X-ray period is the spin period of an accreting white dwarf appears
less tenable. If the ultracompact scenario is correct, then the X-ray flux
cannot be powered by stable accretion which would drive the components apart,
suggesting a new type of energy source (perhaps electromagnetic) may power the
X-ray flux.

with large girth is to shorten codes with small girth in such a manner that the
deleted columns of the parity-check matrix contain all the variables involved
in short cycles. This approach is especially effective if the parity-check
matrix of a code is a matrix composed of blocks of circulant permutation
matrices, as is the case for the class of codes known as array codes. We show
how to shorten array codes by deleting certain columns of their parity-check
matrices so as to increase their girth. The shortening approach is based on the
observation that for array codes, and in fact for a slightly more general class
of LDPC codes, the cycles in the corresponding Tanner graph are governed by
certain homogeneous linear equations with integer coefficients. Consequently,
we can selectively eliminate cycles from an array code by only retaining those
columns from the parity-check matrix of the original code that are indexed by
integer sequences that do not contain solutions to the equations governing
those cycles. We provide Ramsey-theoretic estimates for the maximum number of
columns that can be retained from the original parity-check matrix with the
property that the sequence of their indices avoid solutions to various types of
cycle-governing equations. This translates to estimates of the rate penalty
incurred in shortening a code to eliminate cycles. Simulation results show that
for the codes considered, shortening them to increase the girth can lead to
significant gains in signal-to-noise ratio in the case of communication over an
additive white Gaussian noise channel.

core-collapse supernovae, one will often start from the classical Boltzmann
equation for the neutrino's spatial, temporal, and spectral evolution. For each
neutrino species, and its anti-particle, the classical density in phase space,
or the associated specific intensity, will be calculated as a function of time.
The neutrino radiation is coupled to matter by source and sink terms on the
""right-hand-side"" of the transport equation and together with the equations of
hydrodynamics this set of coupled partial differential equations for classical
densities describes, in principle, the evolution of core collapse and
explosion. However, with the possibility of neutrino oscillations between
species, a purely quantum-physical effect, how to generalize this set of
Boltzmann equations for classical quantities to reflect oscillation physics has
not been clear. To date, the formalisms developed have retained the character
of quantum operator physics involving complex quantities and have not been
suitable for easy incorporation into standard supernova codes. In this paper,
we derive generalized Boltzmann equations for quasi-classical, real-valued
phase-space densities that retain all the standard oscillation phenomenology,
including resonant flavor conversion (the MSW effect), neutrino
self-interactions, and the interplay between decohering matter coupling and
flavor oscillations. With this formalism, any code(s) that can now handle the
solution of the classical Boltzmann or transport equation can easily be
generalized to include neutrino oscillations in a quantum-physically consistent
fashion.

is relatively heavy with mass of order 10 TeV, which is favored in view of the
severe gravitino problem. The form of the moduli superpotential is shown to be
determined, if one imposes a phenomenological requirement that no physical CP
phase arise in gaugino masses from conformal anomaly mediation. This bottom-up
approach allows only two types of superpotential, each of which can have its
origins in a fundamental underlying theory such as superstring. One
superpotential is the sum of an exponential and a constant, which is identical
to that obtained by Kachru et al (KKLT), and the other is the racetrack
superpotential with two exponentials. The general form of soft supersymmetry
breaking masses is derived, and the pattern of the superparticle mass spectrum
in the minimal supersymmetric standard model is discussed with the KKLT-type
superpotential. It is shown that the moduli mediation and the anomaly mediation
make comparable contributions to the soft masses. At the weak scale, the
gaugino masses are rather degenerate compared to the minimal supergravity,
which bring characteristic features on the superparticle masses. In particular,
the lightest neutralino, which often constitutes the lightest superparticle and
thus a dark matter candidate, is a considerable admixture of gauginos and
higgsinos. We also find a small mass hierarchy among the moduli, gravitino, and
superpartners of the standard-model fields. Cosmological implications of the
scenario are briefly described.

set-up, light moduli are stabilized by nonperturbative effects at
supersymmetric AdS vacuum which is lifted to a dS vacuum by supersymmetry
breaking uplifting potential. In such models, soft supersymmetry breaking terms
are determined by a specific mixed modulus-anomaly mediation in which the two
mediations typically give comparable contributions to soft parameters. Similar
pattern of soft terms can arise also in brane models to stabilize the radion by
nonperturbative effects. We examine some phenomenological consequences of this
mixed modulus-anomaly mediation, including the pattern of low energy sparticle
spectrum and the possibility of electroweak symmetry breaking. It is noted that
adding the anomaly-mediated contributions at $M_{GUT}$ amounts to replacing the
messenger scale of the modulus mediation by a mirage messenger scale

$\alpha=m_{3/2}/[M_0\ln(M_{Pl}/m_{3/2})]$ for $M_0$ denoting the

KKLT set-up predicts $\alpha=1$. As a consequence, for $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$,
the model can lead to a highly distinctive pattern of sparticle masses at TeV

thus can explain the coincidence of the dark energy density of the universe.
Secondly, we assume the dark matter particle is meta-stable and decays very
lately into the dark energy scalar field. Such a conversion of matter to dark
energy can give an explanation for the starting time of the accelerating
expansion of the universe. Thirdly, we introduce multiple Affleck-Dine fields

quadrangulation to a fixed reference point, converges in distribution once
rescaled by $n^{1/4}$ to the diameter of the Brownian snake, up to a scaling

invariance principle for a class of random maps that follow a Boltzmann
distribution putting weight $q_k$ on faces of degree $2k$: the radius of such

size, there may exist a window in parameter space where complete

this window, an intermittent transition to synchronization occurs. While
asymptotic transversal Lyapunov exponents allow to determine the
synchronization threshold, the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents,
in the vicinity of the critical frontier, is expected to provide relevant
information on phenomena such as intermittency. In this work we scrutinize the
distribution of finite-time exponents when the local dynamics is ruled by the
logistic map $x \mapsto 4x(1-x)$. We obtain a theoretical estimate for the

Depending on the relative weight of linear versus nonlinear instability
mechanisms associated to the single map two different scenarios for the
transition may occur. When only two maps are considered we always find that the
critical coupling $\epsilon_l$ for chaotic synchronization can be predicted
within a linear analysis by the vanishing of the transverse Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_T$. However, major differences between transitions driven by linear or
nonlinear mechanisms are revealed by the dynamics of the transient toward the
synchronized state. As a representative example of extended systems a one
dimensional lattice of chaotic maps with power-law coupling is considered. In
this high dimensional model finite amplitude instabilities may have a dramatic
effect on the transition. For strong nonlinearities an exponential divergence
of the synchronization times with the chain length can be observed above
$\epsilon_l$, notwithstanding the transverse dynamics is stable against
infinitesimal perturbations at any instant. Therefore, the transition takes
place at a coupling $\epsilon_{nl}$ definitely larger than $\epsilon_l$ and its
origin is intrinsically nonlinear. The linearly driven transitions are
continuous and can be described in terms of mean field results for
non-equilibrium phase transitions with long range interactions. While the
transitions dominated by nonlinear mechanisms appear to be discontinuous.

cross-sectional areas of adjoining channels at each junction. Indeed, this

represented as a vectorial force balance equation, where the force weight
depends on the channel cross-sectional area. A scaling law between the minimal
resistance value and the total volume or surface area value is also derived

channels meet in one junction of optimal bi-dimensional networks, depending on
the flow profile (e.g.: Poiseuille-like or plug-like) and the considered
constraint (fixed volume or surface area). In particular, we show that sources

with DC data, in sharp contrast to the claim. The slope corrections are only
significant for the RIKEN2 CD data. For the GSI kinematics, where in fact one
may observe slope different than for DC (at least for the GSI1 data), they find
a fortuitous cancellation that leads to a vanishingly small slope correction.
Hence the validity of these correction based on the observed slopes can not be
substantiated.

resonances that cannot be considered isolated. Our theory permits to understand
why atoms behave differently from classical Rayleigh point-dipole scatterers,
and how the classical description is recovered for larger but still microscopic
objects like molecules or clusters.

implies that an intra-atomic H-Hbar transition must obey the same quantitative
criteria as a classical intra-molecular Walden inversion. In a trigonal pyramid
model for chiral molecule ABCD with A at the top, chirality is minimal when A
crosses mirror plane BCD at critical angle pi/2 radians or 90 degrees. This
angle is reproduced with one-electron energies of natural perturbed atom H. We
prove how these results are still consistent with Bohr theory and the observed
H-spectrum. Unlike bound state QED, we promote hydrogen mass to a critical
variable and obtain, from first principles, a critical n-value equal to pi. We
detect a Mexican hat or double well potential, hidden in the observed terms of
natural perturbed atom H, which reveals how the symmetry of the electron-proton
bond is broken naturally. The result is that recent claims by ATHENA- and
ATRAP-collaborations on the mass production of Hbar may well be premature and
that H-Hbar bonding schemes may have to be reconsidered, in line with recent
observations (note added in proof: G. Van Hooydonk, Eur Phys J D, 32, 299

For fixed functional forms indicating how to obtain edge weights from the set
cover and, after that, substitution-matrix elements from weighted distances on
the graph, the resulting substitution matrix can be checked for performance
against some known set of reference alignments and for given gap costs. Finding
the appropriate functional forms and gap costs can then be formulated as an
optimization problem that seeks to maximize the performance of the substitution
matrix on the reference alignment set. We give computational results on the
BAliBASE suite using a genetic algorithm for optimization. Our results indicate
that it is possible to obtain substitution matrices whose performance is either
comparable to or surpasses that of several others, depending on the particular

mediated tethers above the shear threshold are stabilized by multiple bonds and
fast rebinding of broken bonds, resulting in tether lifetimes on the timescale
of $10^{-1}$ seconds. Our calculations for cluster dissociation suggest that
the single molecule rebinding rate is of the order of $10^4$ Hz. A similar
estimate results if increased tether dissociation for tail-truncated L-selectin
mutants above the shear threshold is modeled as diffusive escape of single
receptors from the rebinding region due to increased mobility. Using computer
simulations, we show that our model yields first order dissociation kinetics
and exponential dependence of tether dissociation rates on shear stress. Our

1$. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which Grover's iterative
operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and derive its

we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp can take any real positive value or
zero. We regard $x\equiv 2Mnp(\geq 0)$ as a perturbative parameter.] We obtain
recurrence relations between terms in the perturbative expansion. By these
relations, we compute higher orders of the perturbation efficiently, so that we
extend the range of the perturbative parameter that provides a reliable
analysis. Calculating the matrix element numerically by this method, we derive
the maximum value of the perturbative parameter x at which the algorithm finds
a correct item with a given threshold of probability P_{th} or more. (We refer
to this maximum value of x as x_{c}, a critical point of x.) We obtain a curve
of x_{c} as a function of P_{th} by repeating this numerical calculation for
many points of P_{th} and find the following facts: a tangent of the obtained
