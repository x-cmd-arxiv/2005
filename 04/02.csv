the OHS/CISCO spectrograph at Subaru telescope. One target exhibits a strong
emission line which we identify as H-alpha at z = 1.34. Using new and existing
ground-based optical and near-IR imaging, and archival HST imaging, we argue
that this target is essentially an elliptical galaxy, with an old stellar
population of around 4E11 solar masses, but having a dust-enshrouded
star-forming component with a SFR of some 50--100 solar masses per yr. There is
no evidence that the galaxy contains an AGN. Analysis of a further two targets,
which do not exhibit any features in our near-IR spectra, suggests that one is
a quiescent galaxy in the redshift range 1.2 < z < 1.6, but that the other
cannot be conclusively categorised as either star-forming or quiescent.
  Even though our first target has many of the properties of an old elliptical,
the ongoing star formation means that it cannot have formed_all_ of its stellar
population at high redshift. While we cannot infer any robust values for the
star formation rate in ellipticals at z > 1 from this one object, we argue that
the presence of an object with such a high SFR in such a small sample suggests
that a non-negligible fraction of the elliptical galaxy population may have
formed a component of their stellar population at redshifts z ~ 1--2. We
suggest that this is evidence for ongoing star formation in the history of
elliptical galaxies.

photospheric-phase of Type II supernovae (SN). The analyses are based on the
non-LTE model atmosphere code, CMFGEN, of Hillier & Miller (1998). A key asset
of CMFGEN is its thorough treatment of line-blanketing due to metal species.
  From its applicability to hot star environments, the main modifications to
the source code were to allow a linear velocity law, a power-law density
distribution, an adaptive grid to handle the steep H recombination/ionization
front occurring in cooler SN models, and a routine to compute the gray
temperature structure in the presence of large velocities. In this first paper
we demonstrate the ability of CMFGEN to reproduce, with a high level of
accuracy, the UV and optical observations of a sample of well observed Type II
SN, i.e. SN1987A and SN1999em, at representative stages of their photospheric
evolution. Two principal stages of SN are modeled - that where hydrogen is
fully ionized, and that in which H is only partially ionized. We provide
detailed and accurate line identifications for our sample of epochs. We discuss
the impact on the SED of varying the density exponent, the spatial scale of the
SN, the value of Rmax and the metallicity; we illustrate the formation sites
for selected lines. Both Hydrogen Balmer and Helium lines (when present) are
very well reproduced, even for our adopted CNO-equilibrium abundance values
adequate for a massive supergiant progenitor star. NII lines are also predicted
in the blue-wing of both Hbeta and HeI 5875A, and thus not associated with
peculiar absorption/emission far above the photosphere. We finally present a
pedagogical discussion of P-Cygni profile formation and explain, e.g., the
noticeable blue-shift of Halpha in early time spectra (much abridged abstract).

optical photometry. Based on colour-magnitude diagrams and stellar radial
density profiles, we show that these concentrations are not open star clusters.
Instead, they appear to be field stars seen through a differentially-reddened
window. We estimate that the bulk of the stars in both stellar concentrations
is located at $\sim1.5$ kpc from the Sun, a distance consistent with that of
the Sgr-Car arm in that direction. This low-absorption window allows one to
probe into distant parts of the disk besides the Sgr-Car arm, probably the

$\ebv\sim0.5$, so that this window through the disk is comparable in reddening
to Baade's window to the bulge. We also investigate the nature of the open
cluster candidate Ru 166. The presently available data do not allow us to
conclude whether Ru 166 is an actual open cluster or field stars seen through a

from GRB progenitors can create low-density bubbles with sizes and densities
strongly depending on the initial ambient density. A boundary between the
bubble and the dense molecular cloud must exist with the density at the
boundary increasing from that of the bubble to that of the outer cloud. We have
calculated the lightcurves of the afterglows in such environments with three
regions: the stellar wind region, the boundary, and the molecular cloud. We
show that the interaction between the cylindrical jet and the density boundary

acceleration of the Universe. Its presence, which is inferred from an
impressive convergence of high-quality observational results along with some
apparently sucessful theoretical predictions, is also supported by the current
estimates of the age of the Universe from dating of local and high-$z$ objects.
In this paper we test the viability of several dark energy scenarios in the
light of the age estimates of the high redshift ($z=3.91$) quasar APM
08279+5255. Using a chemodinamical model for the evolution of spheroids, we
first reevaluate its current estimated age, as given by Hasinger et al. (2002).
An age of 2.1 Gyr is set by the condition that Fe/O abundance ratio (normalized
to solar values) of the model reaches 3.3, which is the best fit value obtained
in the above reference. It is shown that for the currently accepted value of
the matter density parameter, most of the existing dark energy scenarios cannot
accomodate this old high redshift object unless the Hubble parameter is as low
as $H_o = 58$ $\rm{km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}}$, as recently advocated by Sandage and
collaborators. Even considering less stringent age limits, only cosmological
models that predicts a considerably old Universe at high-$z$ can be compatible
with the existence of this object. This is the case of the conventional
$\Lambda$CDM scenario and some specific classes of brane world cosmologies.

the observation that some clumps have tails. The clumps could form by
gravitational instabilities in accreting disk gas, or they could be captured as
gas-rich dwarf galaxies. Support for this second possibility comes from the
high abundance of nearly identical bare clumps in the UDF field. Several

recently proposed a frequency distribution adjustment scheme, which allows
radiative equilibrium Monte Carlo calculations to be performed without
iteration, by choosing the frequency of each re-emitted photon such that it
corrects for the incorrect spectrum of the previously re-emitted photons.
Although the method appears to yield correct results, we argue that its
theoretical basis is not completely transparent, and that it is not completely
clear whether this technique is an exact rigorous method, or whether it is just
a good and convenient approximation. We critically study the general problem of
how an already sampled distribution can be adjusted to a new distribution by
adding data points sampled from an adjustment distribution. We show that this
adjustment is not always possible, and that it depends on the shape of the
original and desired distributions, as well as on the relative number of data
points that can be added. Applying this theorem to radiative equilibrium Monte
Carlo calculations, we provide a firm theoretical basis for the frequency
distribution adjustment method of Bjorkman & Wood, and we demonstrate that this
method provides the correct frequency distribution through the additional
requirement of radiative equilibrium. We discuss the advantages and limitations
of this approach, and show that it can easily be combined with the presence of
additional heating sources and the concept of photon weighting. However, the

the MeV photon flow and generate relativistic e^\pm pairs. These pairs
re-scatter the soft X-ray photons from the forward shock as well as the prompt
\gamma-ray photons and power detectable high energy emission, significant part

drifting subpulses result from the modulation of the radio emission mechanism
due to long-wavelength drift waves in the magnetosphere. The drift waves are
generated at shorter wavelengths, and their nonlinear evolution favours
accumulation in a specific azimuthal eigenmode with an integral number, $m$, of
nodes encircling the magnetic pole. The electric field of the drift waves is
along the magnetic field lines, and this modulates the distribution for
particles and hence the radio emission mechanism. The ratio of the frequency of
the eigenmode to the rotation frequency of the star is insensitive to the
magnetic field strength and the period of rotation, and is of order unity. The
period, $P_3$, of the drifting subpulses is attributed to the mismatch between
this frequency and the nearest harmonic of the rotation frequency of the star.

transition-metal d electron becomes increasingly localized and undergoes a Mott
transition between CaVO3 and LaTiO3. By defining a low-energy Hubbard
Hamiltonian in the basis of Wannier functions for the t2g LDA band and solving
it in the single-site DMFT approximation, it was recently shown[1] that
simultaneously with the Mott transition there occurs a strong suppression of
orbital fluctuations due to splitting of the t2g levels. The present paper
reviews and expands this work, in particular in the direction of exposing the
underlying chemical mechanisms by means of ab initio LDA Wannier functions
generated with the NMTO method. The Wannier functions for the t2g band exhibit
covalency between the transition-metal t2g, the large cation-d, and the
oxygen-p states; this covalency, which increases along the series, turns out to
be responsible not only for the splittings of the t2g levels, but also for
non-cubic perturbations of the hopping integrals, both of which are decisive
for the Mott transition. We find good agreement with the optical and
photoemission spectra, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital
polarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization
volume for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted. Using
super-exchange theory, we reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and
YTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 which,
without the Jahn-Teller distortion, would be AFM C- or A-type, rather than FM.
Finally, we show that it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t2g LDA
bandstructure to a pseudocubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated
from the two others by a direct gap and has a width, W_I, which is
significantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t2g band. The progressive
GdFeO3-type distortion favours electron localization by decreasing W, by
increasing the splitting of the t2g levels and by decreasing W_I. Our
conclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with
those of Mochizuki and Imada [2].

of carbon nanotubes (NTs) in external electric field. Such arrays are commonly
utilized in field-emission devices, due to the known electrostatic effect of
strong field enhancement near the tip of an individual NT. A small ratio of the
NT radius to the separation between neighboring NTs allows us to obtain
asymptotically exact solution for the distribution of induced charge density
along the NT axes. For a regular array, this solution allows us to trace the
suppression of the field penetration with increasing the density of NTs in the
array. We demonstrate that for a random array, fluctuations in the NT density
terminate the applicability of our result at distances from the NT tips much
larger than the field penetration depth, where the induced charge density is
already exponentially small. Our prime conclusion is that, due to collective
screening of the external field by the array, the field-emission current
decreases drastically for dense arrays compared to an individual NT. We argue
that the reason why the strong field emission, described by the Fowler-Nordheim
law and observed in realistic arrays, is the strong dispersion in heights of
the constituting NTs.

recently attracted great interest by measuring the energy distribution of the
electrons at a given point of the wire, in Saclay. In the diffusive limit with
negligible energy relaxation that shows two sharp steps at the Fermi energies
of the two contacts, which are broadened due to the energy relaxation. In some
of the experiments the broadening is reflecting an anomalous energy relaxation
rate proportional to $E^{-2}$ instead of $E^{-3/2}$ valid for Coulomb
electron-electron interaction, where $E$ is the energy transfer. Later it has
been suggested that such relaxation rate can be due to electron-electron
interaction mediated by Kondo impurities. In the present paper the latter is
systematically studied in the logarithmic approximation valid above the Kondo
temperature. In the case of large applied bias voltage Kondo resonances are
formed at the steps of the distribution function and they are narrowed by
increasing the bias. An additional Korringa energy broadening occurs for the
spins which smears the Kondo resonances, and the renormalized coupling can be
replaced by a smooth but essentially enhanced average coupling (factor of
8-10). Thus the experimental data can be described by formulas without
logarithmic Kondo corrections, but with enhanced coupling. In certain regions
of large bias, that averaged coupling depends weakly on the bias. In those
cases the distribution function depends only on the ratio of the electron
energy and the bias, showing scaling behavior. The impurity concentrations
estimated from those experiments and other dephasing experiments can be very
different, and a possible explanation considering the surface spin anisotropy
due to strong spin-orbit interaction is the subject of our earlier paper.

extensivity of a q-entropy expression. 2) The finding that the time evolution
of the order parameter is described by the dynamics of an intermittent

models. Experimental results have shown significant divergence from simulation
results due to the effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication
channels. In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol
performance. We first study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show
that its effect can be dominating. One of our important conclusions is that
eliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading.
We also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the
presence of fading. Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions
between the MAC and routing layers. We identify several of these problems and
make observations about effective approaches for addressing them. For example,
the criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link
status but also the link order. In addition, because routing protocols rely on
MAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route
failure errors are often generated unnecessarily. Finally, because MAC level
broadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading. We analyze
these effects and outline preliminary solutions to them.

a model of information transmission over unreliable channels. A general
framework for designing efficient multiple description quantization schemes is
proposed in this paper. We provide a systematic treatment of the El Gamal-Cover

region can be achieved via a successive quantization scheme along with
quantization splitting. For the quadratic Gaussian case, the proposed scheme
has an intrinsic connection with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, which
implies that the whole Gaussian MD rate-distortion region is achievable with a
sequential dithered lattice-based quantization scheme as the dimension of the
(optimal) lattice quantizers becomes large. Moreover, this scheme is shown to
be universal for all i.i.d. smooth sources with performance no worse than that
for an i.i.d. Gaussian source with the same variance and asymptotically optimal
at high resolution. A class of low-complexity MD scalar quantizers in the
proposed general framework also is constructed and is illustrated
geometrically; the performance is analyzed in the high resolution regime, which
exhibits a noticeable improvement over the existing MD scalar quantization
schemes.

  Retro-reflectors","12 pages; 11 eps figures",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Because of lunar librations, the retroreflectors left on the moon do not, in
general, face directly at the Earth. Usually this is regarded as a
disadvantage. It results in a spread of arrival times, because each cube that
comprises the retroreflector is at a slightly different distance from the
earth. However, we can turn this same effect into an advantage. Using pulses
and detectors somewhat faster than those currently used for lunar ranging, we
can resolve at least some of the structure of a retroreflector, at least when
the libration angles are large. This additional structure in the transfer
function means that a unique mm level fit can be obtained with many fewer
photons. Fitting to the expected reflector transfer function in general
requires fewer photons than straight averaging, and smoothly reduces to
averaging in the cases where no structure can be resolved. The gains from
resolving the reflectors are largest at large libration angles, exactly the
case where averaging is most inefficient. In these cases the number of photons
needed can be reduced by an order of magnitude or more. Analysis shows that
angles for which the gain is very high happen several times each month, with
the details depending on the exact librations. Experimental validation of this
technique should be possible with existing SLR stations and mockups of the
lunar reflectors.

study. We obtain a very good overall description of the recent H1 data with the
choice of scale Q^2 + E^2_{perp}, in contrast to the (Q^2 + E^2_{perp})/2
required earlier when the resolved contribution was included only at LO
accuracy. We find a more modest variation of the predictions, as the scale is
changed from (Q^2 + E^2_{perp})/2 to 2(Q^2 + E^2_{perp}), as compared to the
case where the resolved contribution was included only at LO accuracy. This
variation is of the order of the rather large experimental errors.
Unfortunately, this fact prevents us from concluding that perturbation theory
gives an unambiguous prediction for forward particle production in deep
inelastic scattering. However, the overall success of perturbative QCD in
explaining the small x_{Bj} data means that perhaps a full resummation of the
BFKL ladder is not called for. We notice the need for rather large resolved

bosonization of fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions, at finite, non-zero temperature
T. This is achieved in the framework of the real time formalism of Thermofield
Dynamics. Formally the results parallel those of the T = 0 case. The well known
two-dimensional Fermion-Boson correspondences at zero temperature are shown to
hold also at finite temperature. In order to emphasize the usefulness of the
operator realization for handling a large class of two-dimensional quantum
field-theoretic problems, we contrast this global approach with the cumbersome
calculation of the fermion-current two-point function in the imaginary-time
formalism and real time formalisms. The calculations also illustrate the very
different ways in which the transmutation from Fermi-Dirac to Bose-Einstein
statistics is realized.

individuals experience long-range social attraction and short range dispersal.
For the case of one spatial dimension, we study the steady states analytically
and numerically. There exist strongly nonlinear states with compact support and
steep edges that correspond to localized biological aggregations, or clumps.
These steady state clumps are approached through a dynamic coarsening process.
In the limit of large population size, the clumps approach a constant density
swarm with abrupt edges. We use energy arguments to understand the nonlinear
selection of clump solutions, and to predict the internal density in the large
population limit. The energy result holds in higher dimensions as well, and is
demonstrated via numerical simulations in two dimensions.

quantum protocols. Quantum protocols are novel communication schemes involving
the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena for representation, storage and
transmission of data. As opposed to quantum computers, quantum communication
systems can and have been implemented using present-day technology; therefore,
the ability to model and analyse such systems rigorously is of primary
importance.
  While current analyses of quantum protocols use a traditional mathematical
approach and require considerable understanding of the underlying physics, we
argue that automated verification techniques provide an elegant alternative. We
demonstrate these techniques through the use of PRISM, a probabilistic
model-checking tool. Our approach is conceptually simpler than existing proofs,
and allows us to disambiguate protocol definitions and assess their properties.
It also facilitates detailed analyses of actual implemented systems. We
illustrate our techniques by modelling a selection of quantum protocols (namely
superdense coding, quantum teleportation, and quantum error correction) and
verifying their basic correctness properties. Our results provide a foundation
for further work on modelling and analysing larger systems such as those used
for quantum cryptography, in which basic protocols are used as components.

in terms of ladder operators acting in the space of Sheffer-type polynomials.
Thus we establish a link between the monomiality principle and the umbral
calculus. We use certain operator identities which allow one to evaluate
explicitly special boson matrix elements between the coherent states. This
yields a general demonstration of boson normal ordering of operator functions
linear in either creation or annihilation operators. We indicate possible
applications of these methods in other fields.

We would like to review the latest development in quantum game theory that is
relevant to information processing. We will begin by illustrating the general
idea of a quantum game and methods of gaining an advantage over
  ""classical opponent"". Then we review the most important game theoretical
aspects of quantum information processing. On grounds of the discussed
material, we reason about possible future development of quantum game theory
