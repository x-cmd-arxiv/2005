simplest sites currently forming stars like our Sun. Because of their
simplicity and proximity, dense cores offer the clearest view of the different
phases of star formation, in particular the conditions prior to the onset of
gravitational collapse. Thanks to the combined analysis of the emission from
molecular lines and the emission/absorption from dust grains, the last several
years have seen a very rapid progress in our understanding of the structure and
chemical composition of starless cores. Previous contradictions between
molecular tracers are now understood to arise from core chemical
inhomogeneities, which are caused by the selective freeze out of molecules onto
cold dust grains. The analysis of the dust emission and absorption, in
addition, has allowed us to derive accurate density profiles, and has made
finally possible to carry out self consistent modeling of the internal
structure of starless cores. In this paper I briefly review the evolution of
core studies previous to the current golden age, and show how multi-tracer
emission can now be modeled in a systematic manner. Finally I show how we can
start to reconstruct the early history of core formation taking advantage of
the chemical changes in the gas.

off-limb, signaling the outward acceleration of wind expansion in Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere beyond 200 mas (~8 R*). We discuss detailed radiative
transfer models that fit the STIS observations showing that the local kinetic
gas temperature in the upper chromosphere exceeds 2600 K. Our radiation

chromosphere show however that the ambient gas temperature remains below 600 K
to sustain the presence of dust grains. Hence, the STIS spectra of Betelgeuse's

co-exist with cool dusty plasma in its outer atmosphere.

radio-selected cataclysmic. In the discovery paper, Bond et al. (2002) show a
spectrum consistent with a magnetic AM Her-type system and a light curve with
rapid, irregular flickering. In contrast, Woudt, Warner, and Pretorius (2004)
found a smoothly-varying light curve with a period near 4.75 h and one minimum
per orbit, indicating a dramatic change. We present time-resolved spectra
showing a superficially normal, mid-G type photosphere, with no detectable
emission lines. The absorption-line radial velocity varies sinusoidally, with
semi-amplitude 268 +- 4 km/s, on the orbital period, which is refined to
0.198094(2) d. At this orbital period the secondary's spectral type is
atypically early, suggesting an unusual evolutionary history. We also obtained
BVI photometry around the orbit. The light curve resembles that given by Woudt
et al., and the color modulation is consistent with a heating effect. A simple
illumination model matches the observations strikingly well with a Roche-lobe
filling secondary near 5650 kelvin being illuminated by a primary giving out
around 2 solar luminosities. The modest amplitude of the observed modulation
constrains the orbital inclination to be less than about 55 deg, unless the
gravity darkening is artificially reduced. The resulting primary star mass is
above the Chandrasekhar limit (assuming conventional gravity darkening). We
examine the possibility that the compact object in this system is not a white
dwarf, in which case this is not actually a cataclysmic variable. On close
examination, FIRST J102347.6+003841 defies easy classification.

active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000. During the event
the pulsating supergiant dimmed by more than a visual magnitude, while its
effective temperature decreased from 7000 K to below 4000 K over about 200 d,
and we directly observed the largest mass-loss rate of about 5% of the solar
mass in a single stellar outburst so far. Over the past three years since the
eruption we observed a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Balmer H
alpha, signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere, also observed
before the 2000 event. Continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the H
alpha line profile has transformed into a P Cygni profile since June 2003,
presently (Sept 2004) signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to ~120 km/s
in the extended upper atmosphere.
  Based on the very recent unique spectral evolution we observed the far-UV
spectrum with the FUSE satellite in July 2004. The FUSE spectrum reveals that
high-temperature plasma emission lines of O VI and C III are absent in the
hypergiant, also observed for the red supergiant Alpha Ori (M2 Iab). On the
other hand, we observe prominent transition region emission lines in the
smaller (less luminous) classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor (F-G Iab-Ia),
indicating that the mean atmospheric extension and surface gravity acceleration
(as compared to effective temperature and atmospheric pulsation) play a major
role for the formation of high-temperature stellar atmospheric plasmas. We
present an overview of the recent spectral variability phases of Rho Cas with

dynamic properties of high-temperature plasmas in the atmospheres of stars. We
model asymmetric emission lines of C III lam977 observed in spectra of luminous
cool stars such as Alpha Aqr, to infer the wind- and microturbulence velocity
structures of the upper chromosphere. Semi-empiric radiative transfer models
that include transition region temperature conditions, are further developed
based on detailed fits to O VI resonance emission lines in the supergiant Alpha
Aqr, the classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor, and to self-absorbed O VI
emission lines in the cataclysmic variable SW UMa.
  We observe that the C III resonance line profile of Alpha Aqr assumes a
remarkable asymmetric shape, reminiscent of P Cygni type profiles observed in
hot luminous supergiants. The model calculations indicate outflow velocities
above ~140 km/s at kinetic temperatures of 65 kK and higher. Based on detailed
model fits to the narrow red-shifted and self-absorbed O VI emission lines of
SW UMa we compute that the gas- and electron-density exceed the density

magnitude. We discuss how detailed semi-empiric fits to emission lines observed
with the high spectral resolution of FUSE can provide reliable constraints on
the mass-loss or mass-accretion rates in these objects.

a series of short thermal pulses that significantly change their luminosity and

period if the star is undergoing Mira pulsations. The American Association of
Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) International Database currently contains
visual data for over 1500 Mira variables. Light curves for these stars span
nearly a century in some cases, making it possible to study the secular
evolution of the pulsation behavior on these timescales. In this paper, we
present the results of our study of period change in 547 Mira variables using
data from the AAVSO. We find non-zero rates of period change, dlnP/dt, at the
2-sigma significance level in 57 of the 547 stars, at the 3-sigma level in 21
stars, and at the level of 6-sigma or greater in eight of the 547. The latter
eight stars have been previously noted in the literature, and our derived rates
of period changes largely agree with published values. The largest and most
statistically significant dlnP/dt are consistent with the rates of period
change expected during thermal pulses on the AGB. A number of other stars
exhibit non-monotonic period changes on decades-long timescales, the cause of
which is not yet known.

models: monofractal fractional Brownian motion, bifractal Levy flights, and
different sorts of multifractal binomial cascades. Our results show that in

WTMM gives biased outcomes for the fractional Brownian motion with different
values of Hurst exponent, indicating spurious multifractality. In some cases
WTMM can also give different results if one applies different wavelets. We do
not exclude using WTMM in real data analysis, but it occurs that while one may
apply MFDFA in a more automatic fashion, WTMM has to be applied with care. In
the second part of our work, we perform an analogous analysis on empirical data

Soc.385:385,2008",,,"gr-qc astro-ph",,"  We consider the Weyl-Dirac theory within the framework of the weak field
approximation and show that the resulting gravitational potential differs from
that of Newtonian by a repulsive correction term increasing with distance. The
scale of the correction term appears to be determined by the time variation
rate of the gravitational coupling. It is shown that if the time variation rate
of gravitational coupling is adopted from observational bounds, the theory can
explain the rotation curves of typical spiral galaxies without resorting to
dark matter. To check the consistency of our theoretical model with observation
we use Likelihood analysis to find the best-fit values for the free parameters.
The mean value for the most important free parameter, $\beta\times 10^{14}
(1/yr)$, using the Top-Hat and Gaussian priors are
$6.38^{+2.44}_{-3.46}_{-6.71}^{+6.18}$ and
$5.72_{-1.18}^{+1.22}_{-2.69}^{+2.90}$, respectively. Although the interval for
which $\beta$ is defined is wide, our results show that the goodness of the fit
is, by and large, not sensitive to this quantity. The intergalactic effects and
gravitational lensing of clusters of galaxies are estimated and seem to be
consistent with observational data.

reported a strange new mode of organization--here called the chimera state--in
which coherence and incoherence exist side by side in the same system of
oscillators. Such states have never been seen in systems with either local or
global coupling; they are apparently peculiar to the intermediate case of
nonlocal coupling. Here we give an exact solution for the chimera state, for a
one-dimensional ring of phase oscillators coupled nonlocally by a cosine

bifurcation from a spatially modulated drift state, and dies in a saddle-node

applying the three-level laser as a auxiliary measuring device. This laser has
