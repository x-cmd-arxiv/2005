(patchiness) imprint arcminute-scale temperature anisotropies in the CMB
through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. We employ an improved
version of an analytic model of reionization devised in Furlanetto et al.(2004)
to calculate the kSZ anisotropy from patchy reionization. This model uses
extended Press-Schechter theory to determine the distribution and evolution of
HII bubbles and produces qualitatively similar reionization histories to those
seen in recent numerical simulations. We find that the angular power spectrum
of the kSZ anisotropies depends strongly on the size distribution of the HII
bubbles and on the duration of reionization. In addition, we show that upcoming
measurements of the kSZ effect should be able to distinguish between several
popular reionization scenarios. In particular, the amplitude of the patchy
power spectrum for reionization scenarios in which the IGM is significantly
ionized by Population III stars (or by mini-quasars/decaying particles) can be
larger (or smaller) by over a factor of 3 than the amplitude in more
traditional reionization histories (with temperature anisotropies that range
between 0.5 and 3 micro-Kelvin at l = 5000). We highlight the differences in
the kSZ signal between many possible reionization morphologies and discuss the
constraints that future observations of the kSZ will place on this epoch.

in which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassive
black holes in galaxies. Nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision
triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration
of the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas and
dust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and UV
wavelengths. Eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and
expels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. Between buried and dead
phases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous
quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of
obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this
phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed
luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a
function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10
Myr for bright quasars in the optical B-band, in good agreement with empirical
estimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 Myr,
naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. However,
observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands
as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We
obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the
quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees
remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from
the SDSS for appropriate luminosity thresholds. (Abridged)

past 7 years been seen as an indication that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating. A new model cosmology, the ""fractal bubble model"", has been
proposed by one of us [gr-qc/0503099], based on the idea that our observed
universe resides in an underdense bubble remnant from a primordial epoch of
cosmic inflation, together with a new solution for averaging in an
inhomogeneous universe. Although there is no cosmic acceleration, it is claimed
that the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae data will nonetheless fit
the new model, since it mimics a Milne universe at low redshifts. In this paper
the hypothesis is tested statistically against the available type Ia supernovae
data by both chi-square and Bayesian methods. While the standard model with
cosmological constant Omega_Lambda = 1-Omega_m is favoured by a Bayesian
analysis with wide priors, the comparison depends strongly on the priors chosen
for the density parameter, Omega_m. The fractal bubble model gives better
agreement generally for Omega_m<0.2. It also gives reasonably good fits for all
the range, Omega_m=0.01-0.55, allowing the possibility of a viable cosmology
with just baryonic matter, or alternatively with both baryonic matter and
additional cold dark matter.

  For the outer disk, the abundance gradient for [Fe/H] deviates from the trend
defined near the solar neighborhood. Rather than declining with increasing
Galactocentric distance, [Fe/H] appears to reach a ""basement"" at [Fe/H]=-0.5
beyond R_GC = 10 to 12kpc. We find enhanced [O/Fe], [alpha/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] in

  An intriguing, but tentative, conclusion is that the outer disk open cluster
abundance ratios are consistent with the outer disk being formed via a merger
event. The basement in [Fe/H] and enhanced [alpha/Fe] suggest that the outer
disk formed from a reservoir of gas with a star formation history distinct from
the solar neighborhood. The open clusters may have formed as a result of star
formation triggered by a merger event in the outer disk. The ages of the outer
disk open clusters would then be a measure of when the merger occurred.

formation of high-mass stars. Modelling of these dense, dusty environments has
demonstrated that pumping by infrared radiation can account for the observed
masers. Collisions with other molecules in the ambient gas also play a
significant role, but have not been well modelled in the past. Here we examine
the effects on the maser models of newly available collision rate coefficients
for methanol. The new collision data does not alter which transitions become
masers in the models, but does influence their brightness and the conditions
under which they switch on and off. At gas temperatures above 100 K the effects
are broadly consistent with a reduction in the overall collision cross-section.
This means, for example, that a slightly higher gas density than identified
previously can account for most of the observed masers in W3(OH). We have also
examined the effects of including more excited state energy levels in the
models, and find that these play a significant role only at dust temperatures
above 300 K. An updated list of class II methanol maser candidates is
presented.

flows and discuss the observational implications of galactic black-hole
candidates and ultraluminous X-ray sources. When the mass accretion rate
exceeds the critical rate, then the shape of the disk is geometrically thick
due to the enhanced radiation pressure. The model spectra of supercritical
accretion flows strongly depend on the inclination angle. Because the outer
disk blocks the emission from the disk inner region for high inclination angle.
We also find that the spectral properties of low-inclination angle and low
accretion-rate disks are very similar to those of high-inclination and high
accretion rate disks. That is, if an object has a high inclination and high
accretion rate, such a system suffers from self-occultation and the spectrum
will be extremely soft. Therefore, we cannot discriminate these differences
from spectrum shapes only. Conversely, if we use the self-occultation
properties, we could constrain the inclination angle of the system. We suggest
that some observed high temperature ultraluminous X-ray sources have near
face-on geometry, i < 40, and Galactic black hole candidate, XTE J1550-564,
possesses relatively high-inclination angles, i > 60.

time-scale, cool by radiative losses due to synchrotron and Inverse Compton
processes. The model is applied to the radio/X-ray knots of several AGN. For
three of these sources we have analyzed long (> 40 ksec) Chandra observations
and report on constrains on the X-ray spectral indices. In the framework of
this model the AGN are inferred to sporadically eject relativistic blobs on
time-scales ranging from 10^{11} to 10^{12} secs for different sources. It is
shown that the collision time-scales can be longer than the age of the knot
and, hence, non-thermal electrons are continuously being injected into the
system. This continuous injection, in contrast to an instantaneous one time
injection, gives rise to a characteristic spectral break, rather than a
high-energy cutoff in the spectrum.

the Optical Luminosity Function (OLF) which we compare with other recent
estimates of the OLF for a variety of environments. The CIG redshift
distribution for n= 956 galaxies re-enforces the evidence for a bimodal
structure seen earlier in smaller samples. The peaks at redshift near 1500 and
6000km/s correspond respectively to galaxies in the local supercluster and
those in more distant large-scale components (particularly Perseus-Pisces). The
two peaks in the redshift distribution are superimposed on 50% or more of the
sample that is distributed in a much more homogeneous way. The CIG probably
represents the most homogeneous local field example that has ever been
compiled. Our derivation of the CIG OLF is consistent with other studies of the
OLF for lower density environments. This comparison via the Schechter parameter
formalization shows that: 1) M* increases with galaxy surface density on the

largest and most complete foundation for studies of isolated galaxies and is

high-resolution $N$-body/SPH simulation, we investigate the formation of an
intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) during the hierarchical formation of a
small spiral galaxy (with a total mass of $10^{10}M_{\odot}$) in the high-$z$
universe. We found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due
to the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is
$\approx 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. As a result of this accretion, an IMBH
with $\approx 10^{4}M_{\odot}$ can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy
at $z\sim 4$. We found that a central BH coevolves with the dark matter halo
from $z\sim 15$ to $z\sim 2$. The mass ratio of the BH to the dark matter halo
is nearly constant $\approx (1-3) \times 10^{-6}$ from $z\sim 10$ to $z\sim 2$.
This is because that change in the dark matter potential enhances star
formation in the central part of the galaxy, and as a result the BH evolves due
to mass accretion via the radiation drag. Therefore, our model naturally
predicts a correlation between massive BHs and dark matter halos. Moreover, it
is found that the final BH-to-bulge mass ratio ($\approx 5\times 10^{-5}$) in a
small spiral galaxy at high-$z$ is much smaller than that in the large galaxies
($\approx 10^{-3}$). Our results also suggest that the scatter in the observed
scaling relations between the bulge mass and black hole mass are caused by a
time lag between BH growth and growth of bulge. We also predict that the X-ray
luminosity of AGN is positively correlated with the CO luminosity in the
central region. By comparing our results with the properties of Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs), it is predicted that some LBGs have massive BHs of $\approx
10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}$.

induced by the radiation drag that is exerted on the interstellar matter by
stellar radiation in globular clusters. The radiation drag extracts angular
momentum from interstellar gas and thus allows the gas to accrete on to the
cluster center.By incorporating the realistic chemical evolution of globular
clusters, we scrutinize the efficiency of the radiation drag to assess the
total accreted mass. As a result, we find that if a globular cluster is more
massive than $\approx 6\times 10^{6}M_{\odot}$ in the present-day stellar
component, a massive BH with $>260M_{\odot}$ can form within it. But, the
BH-to-cluster mass ratio s considerably smaller than the BH-to-bulge mass ratio
($\approx 10^{-3}$) found in galactic bulges. The results are not sensitive to
the assumed stellar initial mass function and star formation rate in the
cluster, as long as the resultant color-magnitude relation, metallicity, and
mass-to-luminosity ratio satisfy those observed in globular clusters. Hence,
the putative linear relation between BH mass and bulge mass($M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm
bulge}$ relation) cannot be extrapolated to globular cluster systems. In the
present regime, we discuss the BH formation in M15, G1, $\omega$ Cen, the M33
nucleus, and the compact X-ray sources in M82. Finally, we argue observational
indications of the formation process of massive BHs in globular clusters. We
find that the final phase of BH growth due to the radiation drag can be
observed as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with $\sim 10^{41}{\rm erg} {\rm

energy to the ISM via jets is dominated by those of the black hole systems, in
contrast to the radiative input, which is dominated by accreting neutron stars.
Summing the energy input from black hole jets L_J in the Milky Way, we find
that it is likely to correspond to >1% of L_SNe, the time-averaged kinetic
luminosity of supernovae, and >5% of L_CR, the cosmic ray luminosity. Given
uncertainties in jet power estimates, significantly larger contributions are
possible. Furthermore, in elliptical galaxies with comparable distributions of
low mass X-ray binaries, but far fewer supernovae, the ratio L_J / L_SNe is
likely to be larger by a factor of ~5. We conclude that jets from X-ray

the potential impact of the intracluster gas. Here, we compare simulations of

thermally conducting gas, and with different implementations of the artificial
viscosity in the SPH simulations. Each cluster was simulated starting from the

study their strong-lensing cross sections computed by means of ray-tracing

turbulence that builds up, which means that the artificial viscosity plays an
important role. With the common viscosity implementation, adiabatic gas has
little effect on strong cluster lensing, while lower viscosity allows stronger
turbulence, thus higher non-thermal pressure and a generally broader gas
distribution which tends to lower lensing cross sections. Conversely, cooling
and star formation steepen the core density profiles and can thus increase the
strong-lensing efficiency considerably.

Since the LMC PL relation is extensively used in distance scale studies, the
non-linearity of the LMC PL relation may affect the results based on this LMC
calibrated relation. In this paper we show that this problem can be remedied by
using the Wesenheit function in obtaining Cepheid distances. This is because
the Wesenheit function is linear although recent data suggests that the PL and
the period-colour (PC) relations that make up the Wesenheit function are not.
We test the linearity of the Wesenheit function and find strong evidence that
the LMC Wesenheit function is indeed linear. This is because the non-linearity
of the PL and PC relations cancel out when the Wesenheit function is
constructed. We discuss this result in the context of distance scale
applications. We also compare the distance moduli obtained from
mu_0=mu_V-R(mu_V-mu_I) (equivalent to Wesenheit functions) constructed with the
linear and the broken LMC PL relations, and find that the typical difference in
distance moduli is ~ +-0.03mag. Hence, the broken LMC PL relation does not
seriously affect current distance scale applications. We also discuss the
random error calculated with equation mu_0=mu_V-R(mu_V-mu_I), and show that
there is a correlation term that exists from the calculation of the random
error. The calculated random error will be larger if this correlation term is
ignored.

drag effect. In the present scenario, the AGN luminosity-dominant phase (QSO

hydrodynamic model has been also applied to disk galaxies. It turns out that
the mass of a SMBH primarily correlates with a bulge component even in a disk

coupled non-linear matching conditions. This may be achieved in several ways,
thus leading to solutions in different regions of the phase diagram. In a

focus to the study of {\em progressive} and instantaneous attacks on {\em
reactive} grown and random PL networks, which can respond to attacks and take
remedial steps. In the process, we present several techniques that managed
networks can adopt to minimize the damages during attacks, and also to
efficiently recover from the aftermath of successful attacks. For example, we
present (i) compensatory dynamics that minimize the damages inflicted by
targeted progressive attacks, such as linear-preferential deletions of nodes in
grown PL networks; the resulting dynamic naturally leads to the emergence of
networks with PL degree distributions with exponential cutoffs; (ii)
distributed healing algorithms that can scale the maximum degree of nodes in a
PL network using only local decisions, and (iii) efficient means of creating
giant connected components in a PL network that has been fragmented by attacks
on a large number of high-degree nodes. Such targeted attacks are considered to
be a major vulnerability of PL networks; however, our results show that the
introduction of only a small number of random edges, through a {\em reverse
percolation} process, can restore connectivity, which in turn allows
restoration of other topological properties of the original network. Thus, the
scale-free nature of the networks can itself be effectively utilized for

adjustable cutoff parameter to ``regularise'' the model. Our treatment brings
out the precise relation between the worm like chain (WLC), the paraxial worm
like chain (PWLC) and the WLRC models. We describe the phenomenon of
``topological untwisting'' and the resulting collapse of link sectors in the
WLC model and note that this leads to a free energy profile {\it{periodic}} in
the applied link. This periodicity disappears when one takes into account the
topology of self avoidance or at large stretch forces (paraxial limit). We note
that the difficult nonlocal notion of self avoidance can be replaced (in an
approximation) by the simpler local notion of ``south avoidance'' in the WLRC
model. This gives an explanation for the efficacy of the approach of Bouchiat
and Mezard in explaining the `hat curves' using the WLRC model.
  We propose a new class of experiments to probe the continuous transition
between the periodic and aperiodic behavior of the free energy.

spin model with long-range and/or multi-spin interactions. It is also closely
related to the recently proposed ""Ginzburg-Landau"" theory for quantum phase
transitions of $s=1/2$ quantum spin systems on a 2D square lattice at zero
temperature. We numerically study the phase structure of the model by
calculating specific heat, spin correlations, instanton density, and
gauge-boson mass. The model has two phases separated by a critical line of
second-order phase transition; O(3) spin-ordered phase and spin-disordered
phase. The spin-ordered phase is the Higgs phase of U(1) gauge dynamics,
whereas the disordered phase is the confinement phase. We find a crossover in
the confinement phase which separates dense and dilute regions of instantons.
On the critical line, spin excitations are gapless, but the gauge-boson mass is
{\it nonvanishing}. This indicates that a confinement phase is realized on the
critical line. To confirm this point, we also study the noncompact version of
the model. A possible realization of a deconfinement phase on the criticality

of containers C1,C2,...,CN and tubes is a typical example of space that is

channels (DMC) is zero when channel capacity is below the code rate and
positive constant otherwise, that is, the Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT)
chart is a step function of channel quality, for any capacity achieving code.
It follows that, for a common class of iterative receivers where the error
correcting decoder must operate at first iteration at rate above capacity (such
as in turbo equalization, turbo channel estimation, parallel and serial
concatenated coding and the like), classical good codes which achieve capacity
over the DMC are not effective and should be replaced by different new ones.
Another meaning of the results is that a good code operating at rate above
channel capacity falls apart into its individual transmitted symbols in the
sense that all the information about a coded transmitted symbol is contained in
the corresponding received symbol and no information about it can be inferred
from the other received symbols. The binary input additive white Gaussian noise

totally distributed manner, where nodes do not have unique identities and make
decisions based only on local information, has applications in sensor,
peer-to-peer, and ad-hoc networks. The task of computing separable functions,
which can be written as linear combinations of functions of individual
variables, is studied in this context. Known iterative algorithms for averaging
can be used to compute the normalized values of such functions, but these
algorithms do not extend in general to the computation of the actual values of
separable functions.
  The main contribution of this paper is the design of a distributed randomized
algorithm for computing separable functions. The running time of the algorithm
is shown to depend on the running time of a minimum computation algorithm used
as a subroutine. Using a randomized gossip mechanism for minimum computation as
the subroutine yields a complete totally distributed algorithm for computing
separable functions. For a class of graphs with small spectral gap, such as
grid graphs, the time used by the algorithm to compute averages is of a smaller
order than the time required by a known iterative averaging scheme.

is of the order of the electroweak coupling at some high energy scale (either
$\sim 10^{16} GeV$ or $\sim O(TeV)$ . The present vacuum energy which is
consistent with a cosmological constant is related to $\Lambda_Z$ and one of

this connection enables us to find a local characterization of {\em conformally

terms of the vanishing of a rank three tensor $T_{abc}$. Similar local
characterizations are found for the most important particular cases such as

speculate with potential applications of the bi-conformal connection to the

exponential of the square root of $Q$. This result takes into account only the
average density of single particle (SP) levels near the Fermi energy. It
ignores two important effects, namely the discreteness of the SP spectrum, and
its fluctuations. We show that the discreteness of the SP spectrum gives rise
to smooth finite--$Q$ corrections. Mathematically, these corrections are
associated to the problem of partitions of an integer. On top of the smooth
growth of the many--body density of states there are, generically,
oscillations. An explicit expression of these oscillations is given. Their
properties strongly depend on the regular or chaotic nature of the SP motion.

  Science and Technology",,,,"physics.soc-ph",,"  In this paper we distinguish between top-performance and lower performance
groups in the analysis of statistical properties of bibliometric
characteristics of two large sets of research groups. We find intriguing
differences between top-performance and lower performance groups, but also
between the two sets of research groups. Particularly these latter differences
are interesting, as they may indicate the influence of research management
strategies. Lower performance groups have a larger scale-dependent cumulative
advantage than top-performance groups. We also find that regardless of
performance, larger groups have less not-cited publications. We introduce a
simple model in which processes at the micro level lead to the observed
phenomena at the macro level. Top-performance groups are, on average, more
successful in the entire range of journal impact. We fit our findings into a
concept of hierarchically layered networks. In this concept, the network of
research groups constitutes a layer of one hierarchical step higher than the
basic network of publications connected by citations. The cumulative
size-advantage of citations received by a group looks like preferential
attachment in the basic network in which highly connected nodes (publications)
increase their connectivity faster than less connected nodes. But in our study
it is size that causes an advantage. In general, the larger a group (node in
the research group network), the more incoming links this group acquires in a
non-linear, cumulative way. Moreover, top-performance groups are about an order
of magnitude more efficient in creating linkages (i.e., receiving citations)
than the lower performance groups.

each other in short-pulse fiber amplifiers. In particular, we consider
chirped-pulse fiber amplifiers at wavelengths for which the fiber dispersion is
normal. The nonlinear phase shift accumulated in the amplifier can be
compensated by the third-order dispersion of the combination of a fiber
stretcher and grating compressor. A numerical model is used to predict the
compensation, and initial experimental results that exhibit the main features
of the calculations are presented. In the presence of third-order dispersion,
an optimal nonlinear phase shift reduces the pulse duration, and enhances the
peak power and pulse contrast compared to the pulse produced in linear
propagation. Contrary to common belief, fiber stretchers can perform as well or
better than grating stretchers in fiber amplifiers, while offering the major
practical advantages of a waveguide medium. The relative benefits of a fiber
stretcher increase with increasing pulse energy, so the results presented here
will be relevant to fiber amplifiers designed for the highest pulse energies.

a nano-mechanical resonator (NAMR) by commonly coupling them to a charge qubit,
a Cooper pair box with a controllable gate voltage. Integrated in this quantum
transducer or simple quantum network, the charge qubit plays the role of a
controllable quantum node coherently exchanging quantum information between the
TLR and NAMR. With such an interface, a maser-like process is predicted to
create a quasi-classical state of the NAMR by controlling a single-mode
classical current in the TLR. Alternatively, a ""Cooper pair"" coherent output
through the transmission line can be driven by a single-mode classical
oscillation of the NAMR.

  patterns","3 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1016/j.physleta.2006.06.085",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a scheme to explore two-photon high-dimensional entanglement
associated with a transverse pattern by means of two-photon interference in a
beamsplitter. We find that the topological symmetry of the angular spectrum of
the two-photon state governs the nature of the two-photon interference. We
prove that the anti-coalescence interference is the signature of two-photon
entanglement. On the basis of this feature, we propose a special Mach-Zehnder
interferometer incorporated with two spiral phase plates which can change the
interference from a coalescence to an anti-coalescence type only for a
two-photon entangled state. The scheme is simple and straightforward compared
with the test for a Bell inequality.

"quant-ph/0504058","Spiridon Dumitru","S. Dumitru","On the uncertainty relations and quantum measurements:
  conventionalities, shortcomings, reconsiderations","44 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Unsolved controversies about uncertainty relations and quantum measurements
still persists nowadays. They originate around the shortcomings regarding the
conventional interpretation of uncertainty relations. Here we show that the
respective shortcomings disclose veridic and unavoidable facts which require
the abandonment of the mentioned interpretation. So the primitive uncertainty
relations appear as being either thought fictions or fluctuations formulae.
Subsequently we reveal that the conventional approaches of quantum measurements
are grounded on incorrect premises. We propose a new approach in which : (i)
the quantum observables are considered as generalized stochastic variables,
(ii) the view is focused only on the pre-existent state of the measured system,
without any interest for the collapse of the respective state, (iii) a
measurement is described as an input-output transformation which modify the
probability density and current but preserve the expressions of the operators.
The measuring uncertainties are evaluated as changes in the probabilistic
estimators of observables. Related to different observables we do not find
reasons of principle neither for uncertainties-connections nor for measuring
compatibility/incompatibility.

  Beams","submitted to journal on March 22,2005",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A new and simple quantum key distribution scheme based on the quantum
intensity correlation of optical twin beams and the directly local measurements
of intensity noise of single optical beam is presented and experimentally
demonstrated. Using the twin beams with the quantum intensity correlation of
5dB the effective bit rate of $2\times 10^7bits/s$ is completed. The noncloning
of quantum systems and the sensitivity of the existing correlations to losses
provide the physical mechamism for the security against eavesdropping. In the
presented scheme the signal modulation and homodyne detection are not needed.
